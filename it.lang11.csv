"149328292-0-2557","Truly heroic deeds were done this day, or so I've heard.",""
"149328292-0-2558","I'm glad you've returned. nnYou'll be disappointed to hear this, but it seems the Daedra are again preparing the summoning ritual in the temple.",""

"149328292-0-2590","You fools are beneath me. My shadows will contend with you. What did Lyranth promise you? Why aid that wretch? There are no spoils here but death. Her clan deserved their fate; their souls will serve me unendingly.",""

"149328292-0-2599","Thank you for bringing me Canuldil's note. At least I know what happened.nnDon't worry about me. We stocked enough supplies for both of us. With just me, I can hide here for a long time.",""
"149328292-0-2600","I can't believe this. All the other apprentices from the Mages Guild were told to evacuate the city. But my master has me running around here, testing the damn water!",""

"149328292-0-2615","My targets return. Pathetic fools!",""
"149328292-0-2616","I'll burn the flesh off your bones!",""
"149328292-0-2617","Fool. You'll die here!",""
"149328292-0-2618","The fool returns to face me yet again!",""

"149328292-0-2627","The veil will be torn. You will not stop us!",""
"149328292-0-2628","Come to feel my wrath again, fool?",""
"149328292-0-2629","Come to me, my lovely. The lady hungers!",""
"149328292-0-2630","So, you return. Your punishment awaits!",""
"149328292-0-2632","Stand and fight, prisoner! You serve the Lord-Warden, now!",""
"149328292-0-2633","I will make potent weapons from your organs.",""

"149328292-0-2646","What? You need something to do? nnTalk to General Nedras, Sergeant Shaghila, or just head out into the sewers. There's enemies in every corner of the city, and I give you permission to kill them all.",""
"149328292-0-2647","Banekin, heal me!",""
"149328292-0-2648","With everything going on out there, I'm just glad we found somewhere safe and dry.",""

"149328292-0-2650","Rise up, old bones!",""
"149328292-0-2651","I don't get why everyone thinks Imperial City is so great.nnThe sewers stink to Sovngarde, I never get to kill anything, and the mead is an affront to the gods.",""
"149328292-0-2652","Decent food, warm bedding—who needs it? I'm having the time of my life down here.nnYou need something?",""
"149328292-0-2653","Not exactly an impervious vault, I know. But beggers can't be choosers.",""
"149328292-0-2654","In these troubled waters, a good soldier needs heavy boots for better footing. nnWhy not weigh yourself down with my wares?",""
"149328292-0-2655","So many soldiers passing through, yet so little security. Ironic, yes?nnIf you store your things with Shamaea though, there's no need to worry. This one knows where to hide things.",""
"149328292-0-2656","My wares are selling faster than hot squirrel jerky in winter, and you know what that means?nnHigher prices! Still affordable for someone like you, I'm sure. Take a look. Just don't try to haggle with me.",""
"149328292-0-2657","Yes, yes, your possessions will be safe here. I have been asked that a hundred times today.",""
"149328292-0-2658","I am a cool Daedric dude shouting orders!",""
"149328292-0-2659","Thank you. I desperately need help. nnXivkyn swarm the city, weaking the veil that protects against Oblivion. They must be stopped!",""
"149328292-0-2660","Your help is appreciated. The Xivkyn will come back, though; we may need you again soon.",""
"149328292-0-2661","Aha! My experiment-tolerant friend! It is so good to see you. I have great news! nnWell, I suppose that depends on your point of view. The fact is that the Veilweavers have returned.",""
"149328292-0-2662","Thank you so much for bringing back my babies!nnIf we can escape this horrid place, the first thing I'll do is buy some leashes!",""

"149328292-0-2664","I don't mean to be rude, but I have a lot of work to do. A lot of repulsive work.nnDon't stray far though. I suspect I'll need more specimens soon.",""
"149328292-0-2665","Ah, my erstwhile assistant returns. Excellent.",""
"149328292-0-2666","Prepare for Holy Fire!",""
"149328292-0-2667","Be bathed in the Shadows of Oblivion!",""
"149328292-0-2668","Attention is not desirable in the CIty these days, but sometimes one must stir up trouble.",""

"149328292-0-2670","Welcome back. You ready to get into trouble?",""
"149328292-0-2671","You there. You must have a story. I doubt it is as dark and full of pain as mine.nnI've lost my son. I don't know if he's alive or dead. I'm sure he thinks me dead.",""

"149328292-0-2673","Father's alive and that's enough for now. Once he's better, we'll discuss his plans to escape the City. I'm never going to leave.",""
"149328292-0-2674","Hide, fool! The Daedra and their minions are everywhere.",""
"149328292-0-2675","Thank you for rescuing me. I must simply rest here for a moment, then I will depart.",""
"149328292-0-2676","I cannot imagine an Imperial City without its Elven Gardens.",""
"149328292-0-2677","I fear the Xivkyn will eventually return to resume their campaign of destruction. If it happens, I hope you too will return to stop them.",""
"149328292-0-2678","You have excellent timing, my friend. It seems the Xivkyn have returned and begun anew their campaign to burn everything in sight.",""
"149328292-0-2679","Your return gladdens Aishah's heart, but she see no opportunities right now. Perhaps later, Walker.",""
"149328292-0-2680","Aishah likes you. And for those she likes, she can always find new opportunities.",""
"149328292-0-2681","So … Daedra like Scarhea don't actually die, do they? They just go back to Coldharbour … you don't think it'll come back again, do you?nnIt better not.",""
"149328292-0-2682","Maybe the Eight haven't forgotten us after all. It's really strange that you just walked in … I don't know if it's destiny or just a coincidence.",""
"149328292-0-2683","Yes? What is it?",""
"149328292-0-2684","Your service to my family will not be forgotten. Thank you.",""
"149328292-0-2685","You've accomplished a great deal, friend. Take a rest. We will likely have need of you tomorrow.",""
"149328292-0-2686","That s'wit! I can't believe she expected me to come back and work for her.",""
"149328292-0-2687","You're back and Gryna isn't. So, you failed in the simple task I gave you. You're just lucky you don't work for me.",""
"149328292-0-2688","Those supplies will certainly taste better than our sandals. Thanks for bringing them!",""
"149328292-0-2689","Careful out there, soldier. The sewers are dangerous, and aboveground is worse!",""
"149328292-0-2691","I hear they're swimming in gold over in the Nobles District.",""
"149328292-0-2692","We should have allied with the Worm Cult ages ago.",""
"149328292-0-2693","Put my blade right through his belly. Served him right!",""
"149328292-0-2694","Did they take any of the Imperial Army to the Arena?",""
"149328292-0-2695","The Nord helmet has a spot, right under the chin, where you can slip the blade through.",""
"149328292-0-2696","I held off at least six of the bannermen while the others retreated.",""
"149328292-0-2697","It was comical. She popped her head out, and I put an arrow in her eye.",""
"149328292-0-2698","So the fool drew a dagger at ten paces! Last mistake he ever made.",""
"149328292-0-2699","Knitting a wound is hard, but it's better than animating dead flesh.",""
"149328292-0-2700","I always found these trees to be rather serene.",""
"149328292-0-2701","That Xivkyn just keeps looking at me. I feel like a mouse under the gaze of a housecat.",""
"149328292-0-2702","The city belongs to the Cult of the Black Worm, above and below.",""
"149328292-0-2703","Mournhold's sewers are far more sanitary.",""

"149328292-0-2705","The fools think we don't know about their sewer base. They'll learn soon enough.",""
"149328292-0-2706","Preserve the corpse, but not too much. A little rot goes a long way.",""
"149328292-0-2707","I like the sewers. The corpses keep better down here.",""
"149328292-0-2708","I detect a foul wind. Predators lurk, unseen.",""

"149328292-0-2989","I knew this would happen!",""
"149328292-0-2990","You have to pay a bounty because you're a bad person.",""
"149328292-0-2991","All right. You can go now.",""
"149328292-0-2992","Now I get to hit you!",""
"149328292-0-2993","You don't want to pick a fight with me. Pay your bounty or else.",""
"149328292-0-2994","Damn. I was hoping you'd run.",""
"149328292-0-2995","And I thought I wouldn't hit anything today!",""
"149328292-0-2996","My scales moisten in your presence. I desire much from you, but I must settle for your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-2997","I erect the spine of bashful farewell.",""
"149328292-0-2998","The wind of justice must blow.",""
"149328292-0-2999","Uhm ... excuse me. I'm going to have to ask you to pay off your bounty .... Or else?",""
"149328292-0-3000","Thanks .... Seriously. Thank you.",""
"149328292-0-3001","Oh, why me?",""
"149328292-0-3002","No one except you and me needs to know about this. Got it?",""
"149328292-0-3003","Plink, plink. Such a musical sound.",""
"149328292-0-3004","Should have paid the gold!",""
"149328292-0-3005","So, criminal, what appendage would you like me to remove? Or will you ruin my fun and pay your fine?",""
"149328292-0-3006","The bounty has been paid. Hurrah.",""
"149328292-0-3007","Ah, and now the fun begins!",""
"149328292-0-3008","Your illicit activities are remarkably noteworthy. I'm almost embarrassed to ask for your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3009","Consider your bounty paid in full.",""
"149328292-0-3010","But I didn't want to hurt you!",""
"149328292-0-3011","You thought you could flee? Everyone thinks they can flee. You won't believe how many get it wrong.",""
"149328292-0-3012","Don't do it again. Though I bet you will.",""
"149328292-0-3013","I have a runner!",""
"149328292-0-3014","One way or another, you'll pay for what you've done. Best to pay the bounty now.",""
"149328292-0-3015","It was inevitable, really.",""
"149328292-0-3016","It's never good to resist fate.",""
"149328292-0-3017","I owe you a bounty. No, that's not right. You owe me a bounty! Yes, that's it!",""
"149328292-0-3018","Good news! The bounty has been paid!",""
"149328292-0-3019","Cease and desist, evildoer!",""
"149328292-0-3020","Criminal. Pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3021","That's right.",""
"149328292-0-3022","Wrong choice!",""
"149328292-0-3023","I hate to ask, but ... if it's all right with you, of course ... could you please pay your bounty?",""
"149328292-0-3024","We're done here? Yes, I believe we are.",""
"149328292-0-3025","Might I trouble you to yield, please?",""
"149328292-0-3026","I guess you didn't see me there. Happens a lot. You still have to pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3027","Everything appears to be in order.",""
"149328292-0-3028","Now, this is too much excitement.",""
"149328292-0-3029","Excuse me. I ... I hate to be a bother, but I'm supposed to ask you to pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3030","I did it! I collected a bounty!",""
"149328292-0-3031","I wish it hadn't come to this!",""
"149328292-0-3032","The Eight may know you atoned for your crime, but I need to see your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3033","Praise the Eight! The bounty is paid!",""
"149328292-0-3034","Halt, scoundrel, or face judgment!",""
"149328292-0-3035","You don't want to be here. I don't want to be here. Just pay your bounty so we can get on with our lives.",""
"149328292-0-3036","Yeah, yeah. Just move along.",""
"149328292-0-3037","Just my luck!",""
"149328292-0-3038","Do you know how to pay your bounty, or are you as stupid as every other criminal I deal with?",""
"149328292-0-3039","Sometimes even the dumb ones surprise me.",""
"149328292-0-3040","The ignorant never learn!",""
"149328292-0-3041","I understand. Times are tough. But you still have to pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3042","See? That was easy.",""
"149328292-0-3043","I was having such a nice day!",""
"149328292-0-3044","Why would you do something like that? Do you enjoy paying bounties?",""
"149328292-0-3045","Honestly, the nerve of some people.",""
"149328292-0-3046","Stop that! Stop that at once!",""
"149328292-0-3047","Such sad business, collecting criminal bounties. Now pay up before I start weeping.",""
"149328292-0-3048","How sad. Your name has been cleared.",""
"149328292-0-3049","It's probably my fault.",""
"149328292-0-3050","This is a simple clerical matter. Pay your bounty and we can remove this blemish from your record.",""
"149328292-0-3051","Consider your debt to society paid in full.",""
"149328292-0-3052","I am within my rights to use force!",""
"149328292-0-3053","If you wanted to meet me, you could have asked. Now I have to make this official.",""
"149328292-0-3054","Maybe we'll meet later. We could ... talk.",""
"149328292-0-3055","I thought we had a good thing going!",""
"149328292-0-3056","Not much fun to walk around with a price tag on your head, is it? How about you pay up?",""
"149328292-0-3057","Good deal. On your way now.",""
"149328292-0-3058","You people never learn, do you?",""
"149328292-0-3059","To break the law is to demand more of destiny than one is due. There are consequences for such acts.",""
"149328292-0-3060","May the gods help you, my friend.",""
"149328292-0-3061","Stendarr's justice must be done.",""
"149328292-0-3062","Hello. Excuse me? Over here. I'm supposed to collect a bounty from you, I think.",""
"149328292-0-3063","I'm so glad that's done with.",""
"149328292-0-3064","Why does this always happen to me?",""
"149328292-0-3065","It's great to meet you! I wish it were under better circumstances. Alas, I must ask for your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3066","Much obliged! You're free to go.",""
"149328292-0-3067","And this was going so well!",""
"149328292-0-3068","There is a protocol that must be followed in these matters. It starts with you paying your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3069","For the record, your honor has been restored.",""
"149328292-0-3070","Such malfeasance cannot be ignored!",""
"149328292-0-3071","I don't have time for messing around. Pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3072","Good choice. Now get out of here.",""
"149328292-0-3073","I'm going to make this hurt!",""
"149328292-0-3074","Your reign of evil ends here, malefactor! Pay your bounty or suffer the consequences!",""
"149328292-0-3075","Hurrah! The bounty is paid in full!",""
"149328292-0-3076","Escape? What audacity!",""
"149328292-0-3077","I'm not looking for a fight, but I-I have to ask you to pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3078","Thank you. A lot.",""
"149328292-0-3079","Gall and pox, I hate this!",""
"149328292-0-3080","I'd love to just let you go, but that wouldn't be good for either of us. So pay your fine, all right?",""
"149328292-0-3081","Look how easy that was!",""
"149328292-0-3082","Why'd you go and do that?",""
"149328292-0-3083","Look, we all make mistakes. Pay the fine and we can put this ugly business behind us.",""
"149328292-0-3084","Quick and painless, right? Off ya go.",""
"149328292-0-3085","Oh, why'd you have to do that?",""
"149328292-0-3086","You can go no further unless you settle the bounty for your crimes.",""
"149328292-0-3087","That's that, then.",""
"149328292-0-3088","The painful approach, then!",""
"149328292-0-3089","Pay the bounty and you'll be on your way. Come, let's not make a scene.",""
"149328292-0-3090","Be on your way, then.",""
"149328292-0-3091","That was your last mistake!",""
"149328292-0-3092","You need to pay my tab. I mean, your bounty. Criminal.",""
"149328292-0-3093","You're a good kid.",""
"149328292-0-3094","You won't win this fight!",""
"149328292-0-3095","By the Three, my rights and duties. Ha! Right now my right and duty is to squeeze you for gold.",""
"149328292-0-3096","Hmm. Pleasure doing business.",""
"149328292-0-3097","I love a good chase!",""
"149328292-0-3098","You're a criminal? Really? I don't think so. Still, if you insist on paying a bounty, I'll accept it.",""
"149328292-0-3099","I doubt you'll try anything like this again.",""
"149328292-0-3100","I doubt you'll defeat me!",""
"149328292-0-3101","The choice is clear. Pay your bounty forthwith or suffer the consequences!",""
"149328292-0-3102","Go and transgress no more!",""
"149328292-0-3103","You motivate me to violence, cur!",""
"149328292-0-3104","We can do this the pay-your-fine way or the tear-you-to-pieces way. Your pick.",""
"149328292-0-3105","The boring choice, then.",""
"149328292-0-3106","I was hoping you'd do that!",""
"149328292-0-3107","I'm not surprised you turned out to be a criminal.",""
"149328292-0-3108","You paid? Surprising.",""
"149328292-0-3109","Criminals are all cowards!",""
"149328292-0-3110","Be a good scoundrel and pay your bounty. It's the right thing to do.",""
"149328292-0-3111","I love it when criminals pay!",""
"149328292-0-3112","If you get blood on my boots, I'll kill you twice!",""
"149328292-0-3113","Pay your bounty and we'll have no trouble.",""
"149328292-0-3114","Your compliance is appreciated.",""
"149328292-0-3115","I will end you!",""
"149328292-0-3116","Hands where I can see them. I believe you have a bounty to pay.",""
"149328292-0-3117","Very well. On your way then.",""
"149328292-0-3118","This is simply not proper!",""
"149328292-0-3119","This can't be right. You could never do that to a live guar. Going to strike that as an error ... now, for the rest of your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3120","Good. That's good.",""
"149328292-0-3121","I gave you a chance!",""
"149328292-0-3122","Another vagrant disgracing my streets. Typical. Just pay the bounty and move along.",""
"149328292-0-3123","Another happy customer. Huzzah.",""
"149328292-0-3124","Did you not notice my foul mood?",""
"149328292-0-3125","Just my luck, bumping into the likes of you. Know what this means? Just more dung to deal with.",""
"149328292-0-3126","Go on. No need to stand there gawking.",""
"149328292-0-3127","Why do I always get the violent ones?",""
"149328292-0-3128","I have no choice but to follow orders. You? I have no idea why you decided to enter a life of crime.",""
"149328292-0-3129","You paid, so move along.",""
"149328292-0-3130","Why do I always get the eager ones?",""
"149328292-0-3131","By Almsivi, I'll have your bounty or I'll have your hide.",""
"149328292-0-3132","Begone from my sight.",""
"149328292-0-3133","Is this how you choose to die?",""
"149328292-0-3134","Please! Don't attack. I'm just doing my job. Can you give me your bounty and let this go?",""
"149328292-0-3135","Oh! Thank the gods!",""
"149328292-0-3136","Please, don't hurt me!",""
"149328292-0-3137","You're just another lowlife fetcher who broke the law and got caught. Now you have to pay.",""
"149328292-0-3138","Now get lost, scum.",""
"149328292-0-3139","This should be easy!",""
"149328292-0-3140","Anyone who says crime doesn't pay hasn't seen me in action. My deals with criminals always turn a profit!",""
"149328292-0-3141","I was hoping for more, but this will do.",""
"149328292-0-3142","Why couldn't you just take the deal?",""
"149328292-0-3143","Pay the bounty or meet your end. Very painful ... much folding.",""
"149328292-0-3144","Sufficient.",""
"149328292-0-3145","A puzzling tactical choice!",""
"149328292-0-3146","If not for poor choices, this one thinks you would never make decisions. Pay up, yes?",""
"149328292-0-3147","Good decision. On your way now.",""
"149328292-0-3148","Don't say this one didn't warn you!",""
"149328292-0-3149","By order of the law, pay your bounty!",""
"149328292-0-3150","Very satisfactory.",""
"149328292-0-3151","Guards, to me!",""
"149328292-0-3152","I mean you no harm. But if you refuse to pay the bounty for your crimes, this one must fight you.",""
"149328292-0-3153","There is wisdom in your choice.",""
"149328292-0-3154","If that is your wish.",""
"149328292-0-3155","This one has a thing for criminals. That's why I got into this line of work. But I still need to collect your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3156","I hope that was good for you, too.",""
"149328292-0-3157","This one hates rejection!",""
"149328292-0-3158","Aren't you in trouble now? Fortunately, I can make trouble go away. I just need a little gold, yes?",""
"149328292-0-3159","This will do nicely.",""
"149328292-0-3160","There's nowhere you can hide from me!",""
"149328292-0-3161","This one wonders, will you pay your bounty or will you die?",""
"149328292-0-3162","This one always collects her bounties.",""
"149328292-0-3163","I love it when they try to run!",""
"149328292-0-3164","Allow me to introduce myself. I am the guard who will be collecting your bounty, yes?",""
"149328292-0-3165","The law forgives you, my friend!",""
"149328292-0-3166","Very well. Pain it is!",""
"149328292-0-3167","You don't look violent. That's good, as this one prefers to deal with civilized scoundrels.",""
"149328292-0-3168","Well, that worked out in everyone's favor.",""
"149328292-0-3169","I don't want to chase you!",""
"149328292-0-3170","This one thinks you ugly and stupid, like all muskarse criminals.",""
"149328292-0-3171","Leave now before I get angry.",""
"149328292-0-3172","This one hoped you'd refuse!",""
"149328292-0-3173","Please don't make this one get his fur dirty! Not for one so pathetic as you. Just pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3174","Go away now, smelly one!",""
"149328292-0-3175","Another rat to be rid of, then!",""
"149328292-0-3176","Halt, walker. It seems that your crimes have caught up with you. Time to pay the fine, yes?",""
"149328292-0-3177","This one thanks you for your cooperation.",""
"149328292-0-3178","Then I'm obliged to use force!",""
"149328292-0-3179","You have a bounty to pay. This one takes it straight to the guard commander. Promise!",""
"149328292-0-3180","Sleek. Now walk on.",""
"149328292-0-3181","Where do you run, dung-eater?",""
"149328292-0-3182","I hope you reach for coin, and not a weapon. Paying the bounty is much easier.",""
"149328292-0-3183","Easy, yes? You are free to go.",""
"149328292-0-3184","That was not a request!",""
"149328292-0-3185","This one believes you should be punished, since you were stupid enough to get caught.",""
"149328292-0-3186","Move along or I'll charge you again.",""
"149328292-0-3187","I hoped you wouldn't listen to reason!",""
"149328292-0-3188","Bounty. Now.",""
"149328292-0-3189","Good.",""
"149328292-0-3190","Not another step!",""
"149328292-0-3191","Let's not overcomplicate this. You committed a crime and got caught. Pay your bounty and you can go.",""
"149328292-0-3192","All right. I'll be on my way then.",""
"149328292-0-3193","I can't let you walk away!",""
"149328292-0-3194","I understand completely. Slip a little extra into your payment and I'll forget I ever saw you.",""
"149328292-0-3195","Criminal? I see no criminal here.",""
"149328292-0-3196","Then we work it out in battle!",""
"149328292-0-3197","Pay the bounty and get out of my way.",""
"149328292-0-3198","Stupid criminal.",""
"149328292-0-3199","Ugly and dumb, eh?",""
"149328292-0-3200","I've had a hard day. Just pay your bounty and let's be done with this business.",""
"149328292-0-3201","My tired feet thank you for cooperating.",""
"149328292-0-3202","Don't make me chase you, felon!",""
"149328292-0-3203","Pay or die, criminal!",""
"149328292-0-3204","The penalty has been paid!",""
"149328292-0-3205","That's your last mistake!",""
"149328292-0-3206","You're going to pay off your bounty, right? I'd hate to bloody such a pretty face.",""
"149328292-0-3207","See? Easy. Now keep that nose clean.",""
"149328292-0-3208","Such a waste!",""
"149328292-0-3209","Troll's blood! You owe a bounty? I'll happily accept payment to take care of that.",""
"149328292-0-3210","Another happy customer!",""
"149328292-0-3211","The horker wants to fight? Gladly!",""
"149328292-0-3212","You owe a bounty for your crimes, and I'll accept not a coin less.",""
"149328292-0-3213","You are now authorized to go.",""
"149328292-0-3214","Duty demands I use force!",""
"149328292-0-3215","I need some gold. For … for your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3216","You did good, pup.",""
"149328292-0-3217","I fight best when I'm drunk!",""
"149328292-0-3218","I don't have time for any nonsense. Pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3219","Good choice. Now go away.",""
"149328292-0-3220","This doesn't improve my mood!",""
"149328292-0-3221","No need to worry. Just pay your fine and be on your way.",""
"149328292-0-3222","Thank you for being reasonable.",""
"149328292-0-3223","Even I have limits!",""
"149328292-0-3224","You've broken the law. Now it's time to ... wait, what time is it? Time to pay, that's it!",""
"149328292-0-3225","Oh, thank the Eight! I mean ... good.",""
"149328292-0-3226","Oh dear. Stop!",""
"149328292-0-3227","Don't be a horker. Just pay your bounty and be done with it.",""
"149328292-0-3228","Nice doing business with you.",""
"149328292-0-3229","No one ever wants to pay!",""
"149328292-0-3230","Great news! You get to pay your debt to society in gold! Could be worse, right?",""
"149328292-0-3231","Excellent! It's been a pleasure.",""
"149328292-0-3232","Ah well. Can't win them all!",""
"149328292-0-3233","Well, look at you! I'm sure we can work something out so you can put this business behind you.",""
"149328292-0-3234","I regret that I must go back to my patrol. Maybe later?",""
"149328292-0-3235","You ruined such a nice time!",""
"149328292-0-3236","Uh, what is it you did again? No matter. Just pay the bounty and we're fine.",""
"149328292-0-3237","Um, what was this for?",""
"149328292-0-3238","I think I have to kill you now!",""
"149328292-0-3239","I don't care what you did or who you did it to. Just give me the gold, and I'll look the other way.",""
"149328292-0-3240","Just keep walking then.",""
"149328292-0-3241","Have it your way!",""
"149328292-0-3242","I'm here to help you. Nah, not really. I just want to collect your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3243","I live to serve.",""
"149328292-0-3244","You realize, this means war!",""
"149328292-0-3245","Hey! Yeah, you! I saw what you did. Pay the fine or face the consequences!",""
"149328292-0-3246","Hrmph. Now get lost.",""
"149328292-0-3247","I warned you!",""
"149328292-0-3248","You got a bounty to pay, runt. And no funny business. Someone's gonna count it.",""
"149328292-0-3249","Golly, this is heavy.",""
"149328292-0-3250","Oh, you're gonna get it!",""
"149328292-0-3251","You're just going to go back to breaking the law, I know. But I still need to get your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3252","I guess I need to turn this in.",""
"149328292-0-3253","Can't say I'm surprised!",""
"149328292-0-3254","Argh! I hate paperwork! Look, just pay your fine and we'll forget all about this.",""
"149328292-0-3255","That's right, you paid!",""
"149328292-0-3256","I stink at this job!",""
"149328292-0-3257","There's no point in making me wait. Pay the bounty or face the consequences.",""
"149328292-0-3258","You did well to pay me, criminal.",""
"149328292-0-3259","You should have paid!",""
"149328292-0-3260","Should've skipped that last shot of Ungorth. I see three criminals. One of you, give me a bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3261","You're smart. I like that.",""
"149328292-0-3262","All right. Stand still, then!",""
"149328292-0-3263","I feel all woozy when you're around. I'll ask for your bounty so we can spend more time together.",""
"149328292-0-3264","A shame. I don't want to say goodbye.",""
"149328292-0-3265","I was hoping for a different kind of contact!",""
"149328292-0-3266","We make the strongholds we live in. Yours has a foundation that's cracked and rotten.",""
"149328292-0-3267","You're free. For now.",""
"149328292-0-3268","If you escape, someone else will find you!",""
"149328292-0-3269","Another stupid bounty. What's the point ....",""
"149328292-0-3270","Yeah, fine. Now get lost.",""
"149328292-0-3271","Typical!",""
"149328292-0-3272","Got yourself into some trouble, eh? Give me your bounty. I'll sort it out ... trust me.",""
"149328292-0-3273","Smart. Next time, don't get caught.",""
"149328292-0-3274","Ha, you asked for it!",""
"149328292-0-3275","Someone said something about wine. No, that's not right. You owe a fine! That's it!",""
"149328292-0-3276","See you later, lawbreaker.",""
"149328292-0-3277","Now this I understand!",""
"149328292-0-3278","You thought you could get away. Why do they always try to get away?",""
"149328292-0-3279","Finally. Someone sensible.",""
"149328292-0-3280","You won't get away, weakling!",""
"149328292-0-3281","By blade and blood, halt villain and hand over your bounty!",""
"149328292-0-3282","A pleasure doing business with you!",""
"149328292-0-3283","I'm no easy prey, villain!",""
"149328292-0-3284","Am I standing too close? Too bad, Elf-breath! I want your bounty and I want it now.",""
"149328292-0-3285","Just my luck. You paid.",""
"149328292-0-3286","Finally! Now I get to hit something!",""
"149328292-0-3287","I respectfully request you shut your mouth and pay your fine.",""
"149328292-0-3288","I knew you'd cooperate.",""
"149328292-0-3289","Lawbreaker, stand down!",""
"149328292-0-3290","The journals of justice tell many tales about what befalls criminals who refuse to make payment.",""
"149328292-0-3291","This will suffice.",""
"149328292-0-3292","Criminals never cease to surprise me!",""
"149328292-0-3293","In my land, crimes are paid for in flesh and blood. Fortunately for you, we deal in gold here.",""
"149328292-0-3294","Next time you will not be so fortunate.",""
"149328292-0-3295","I take such pleasure in destroying you!",""
"149328292-0-3296","In the name of the law, make restitution, infidel dog!",""
"149328292-0-3297","I am satisfied with your penance.",""
"149328292-0-3298","You dare turn your back to me?",""
"149328292-0-3299","I hope I am not disturbing you. It appears you've committed a crime, and I must collect a bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3300","Much gratitude.",""
"149328292-0-3301","You should have complied!",""
"149328292-0-3302","Bounty. Now.",""
"149328292-0-3303","Hrmph.",""
"149328292-0-3304","You coward!",""
"149328292-0-3305","I simply wish to collect the bounty for your crimes, but I will fight if you prefer.",""
"149328292-0-3306","The wise choice is always the best choice.",""
"149328292-0-3307","When we draw weapons, everyone loses.",""
"149328292-0-3308","In exchange for a mere handful of gold, I can make your troubles go away.",""
"149328292-0-3309","Mark this one paid in full.",""
"149328292-0-3310","You wish to flee? How cute!",""
"149328292-0-3311","Hand over the bounty. I'm not asking twice.",""
"149328292-0-3312","That's right.",""
"149328292-0-3313","You have a problem now!",""
"149328292-0-3314","Neither of us wants a fight. So how about you pay the bounty for your crimes?",""
"149328292-0-3315","Right. Move along, then.",""
"149328292-0-3316","Don't be unreasonable!",""
"149328292-0-3317","No more games. Your bounty. Now.",""
"149328292-0-3318","Good. Now go.",""
"149328292-0-3319","So be it!",""
"149328292-0-3320","Desist from your crimes and pay restitution.",""
"149328292-0-3321","Satisfactory.",""
"149328292-0-3322","You are too bold for your own well-being!",""
"149328292-0-3323","Let's put this unfortunate business behind us, friend. Pay your bounty and you're free to go.",""
"149328292-0-3324","Perfect. Stay out of trouble now.",""
"149328292-0-3325","There's no need for this!",""
"149328292-0-3326","I refuse to work up a sweat for someone as pathetic as you. Just pay your bounty and go away.",""
"149328292-0-3327","The infidel dog has paid the bounty!",""
"149328292-0-3328","You're hardly worthy!",""
"149328292-0-3329","Duty demands I request you pay your bounty. It also demands I warn you that refusal would be unwise.",""
"149328292-0-3330","Long may you prosper, former criminal.",""
"149328292-0-3331","I find no joy in this!",""
"149328292-0-3332","I hope that's gold and not a weapon you're reaching for. Paying is much easier than the alternative.",""
"149328292-0-3333","That was easy. You're free to go.",""
"149328292-0-3334","I warned you!",""
"149328292-0-3335","You have failed!",""
"149328292-0-3336","Buying or selling?",""
"149328292-0-3337","Coins burning a hole in your pouch?",""
"149328292-0-3338","Can I interest you in something?",""
"149328292-0-3339","It's about damn time someone showed up. We can't have these Daedra taking over our city. nnI'm glad to see you're stepping up to rectify the situation.",""
"149328292-0-3340","My gods-damned parents sent you, didn't they? Fobbing bastards said they were coming back for me. nnI knew they were lying. The only thing they care about is saving their own arses.",""
"149328292-0-3341","You are a credit to your alliance, wayfarer, and a friend to this city. I hope you will stay until the city has been reclaimed.",""
"149328292-0-3342","I wasn't expecting to see you back here so soon. You're a busy little bastard, aren't you?",""
"149328292-0-3343","I fear that General Pollius may not have the heart to do what is necessary. These Legion Zero traitors are not our friends. Not any more. We do not have the luxury of mercy.",""
"149328292-0-3344","The Bloodworks Drainage. That's where we should be.",""
"149328292-0-3345","My thirst cannot be slaked on daedrats alone.",""
"149328292-0-3346","I may serve Molag Bal now, but I will always honor Malacath.",""
"149328292-0-3347","How long must we hunt? Are we not to be rewarded for our service?",""
"149328292-0-3348","I would reign supreme in the arena.",""
"149328292-0-3349","Master Otholug is our chieftain.",""
"149328292-0-3350","Molag Bal recognizes our strength. We no longer need Malacath.",""
"149328292-0-3351","We are no longer pariahs, but the blessed children of Molag Bal.",""
"149328292-0-3352","Blood is one thing, but this one's paws cannot abide such filth.",""
"149328292-0-3353","There's no good line of sight here.",""
"149328292-0-3354","If we plan this right, we can have a little target practice.",""
"149328292-0-3355","This place is unsanitary. I cannot work in these conditions.",""
"149328292-0-3356","Deep in the Alessian Catacombs. Whatever it is, it's ugly.",""
"149328292-0-3357","I swear, fool--I will slice your hand right off.",""
"149328292-0-3358","Demonstrate what happens when one challenges the Xivkyn.",""
"149328292-0-3359","You're expected to sacrifice your current form to keep the gates.",""
"149328292-0-3360","Our victory is on the horizon.",""
"149328292-0-3361","The worms offend me with their weakness.",""
"149328292-0-3362","I will flank them when they appraoch.",""
"149328292-0-3363","The meat of the mortals will decorate my implements.",""
"149328292-0-3364","The Dark Lord has sent word. Burn it. Burn it all.",""
"149328292-0-3365","I care not for the concerns of a lowly Dremora.",""
"149328292-0-3366","It's an insult—the filth and these petty  mortals scurrying at my feet.",""
"149328292-0-3367","This mortal legion serves well, better even than some of the Dremora.",""
"149328292-0-3368","I sense your presense, mortal. Engage me if you wish, but know this—I've never been defeated.",""
"149328292-0-3369","There are still many mortals in these sewers. A purge is required.",""
"149328292-0-3370","This mortal land is too colorful for my taste.",""
"149328292-0-3371","This mortal land is too colorful for my taste.",""
"149328292-0-3372","Halt at once!",""
"149328292-0-3373","The eye of the law is all-seeing.",""
"149328292-0-3374","Well … you paid your bounty. I suppose I can be seen speaking with you.",""
"149328292-0-3375","I keep my nose in my own business.",""
"149328292-0-3376","You tried to kill someone!",""
"149328292-0-3377","Help!",""
"149328292-0-3378","Gods, what a terrible thing!",""
"149328292-0-3379","So barbaric.",""
"149328292-0-3380","Murderer! Get away from me!",""
"149328292-0-3381","Wouldn't be wise for us to talk.",""
"149328292-0-3382","Stay away!",""
"149328292-0-3383","I didn't see anything, I swear. I'm blind as a bat.",""
"149328292-0-3384","Don't pull anything, or I'll tell the Guard.",""
"149328292-0-3385","There's a thief among us.",""
"149328292-0-3386","Unholy creature!",""
"149328292-0-3387","W-w-werewolf!",""
"149328292-0-3388","Hmm. I must have left it in that tree.",""
"149328292-0-3389","Touch me again and I'll take your finger!",""
"149328292-0-3390","Think you can just walk right in? No you can not.",""
"149328292-0-3391","That's it. You've forced me to call the Guard.",""
"149328292-0-3392","Fine. I'll let it go, this time.",""
"149328292-0-3393","Stop right there, outlaw!",""
"149328292-0-3394","The Guard has no tolerance for criminals.",""
"149328292-0-3395","The Eight frown on criminal activity. Just a thought.",""
"149328292-0-3396","Do you think I care what you do?",""
"149328292-0-3397","Why would you do that?",""

"149328292-0-3406","That doesn't belong to you!",""
"149328292-0-3407","Bloodsucking fiend!",""
"149328292-0-3408","Arkay have mercy--it's a werewolf!",""
"149328292-0-3409","Oh no! I should have left it at home!",""
"149328292-0-3410","Hands off, thief!",""
"149328292-0-3411","You can't just walk in here.",""
"149328292-0-3412","That's it. You've forced me to call the Guard.",""
"149328292-0-3413","Just don't make that mistake again.",""
"149328292-0-3414","Stop right there!",""

"149328292-0-3417","Hmph. So uncivilized.",""
"149328292-0-3418","Stop this instant!",""
"149328292-0-3419","Help me!",""
"149328292-0-3420","By the Stars, what have you done?",""
"149328292-0-3421","Do you think I won't report that? Guard!",""
"149328292-0-3422","What savagery!",""
"149328292-0-3423","This will have to wait until you clear your bounty.",""
"149328292-0-3424","Stay back!",""

"149328292-0-4113","What in Y'ffre's name are you doing?",""

"149328292-0-4149","Don't take another step.",""
"149328292-0-4150","Hm. If you were about to break the law, I'd have no idea.",""

"149328292-0-4950","I'm far too important to care what you do.",""
"149328292-0-4951","Why must everyone be so violent?",""
"149328292-0-4952","Someone get over here!",""

"149328292-0-4969","My patience only extends so far.",""
"149328292-0-4970","You've cleared your name, so I guess I can do business with you.",""

"149328292-0-5850","Stop! That's an order!",""
"149328292-0-5851","Don't try it. I'm not a guard because of my winning personality.",""

"149328292-0-6405","I don't deal in relics or anything that smells of the blood-curse.",""
"149328292-0-6406","Look what the desert winds blew in! Welcome, friend!",""
"149328292-0-6407","My, you've been busy! Let us do business, my friend.",""
"149328292-0-6408","No one brings me anything good anymore. Perhaps you'll change all that?",""
"149328292-0-6409","I grow weary of moving the same old goods. Have you brought me something new?",""
"149328292-0-6410","Great, another customer! What have you brought me?",""
"149328292-0-6411","I can't wait to see what you have. I'm a-tingle with anticipation!",""
"149328292-0-6412","I try to keep my dealings with common criminals to a minimum.",""
"149328292-0-6413","I do hope you have some quality merchandise. My last client was a disappointment.",""
"149328292-0-6414","After we conclude our business, you must have a drink!",""
"149328292-0-6415","In honor of the Konunleikar, I'm offering a number of specials today.",""
"149328292-0-6416","Aren't you a tall glass of mead! I hope you came to see me.",""
"149328292-0-6417","I admit it. I'm attracted to the darker side of life. It's why I got into this business.",""
"149328292-0-6418","Trying to move your ill-gotten gains? Fine, show me.",""
"149328292-0-6419","No time for chatter. Show me the goods.",""
"149328292-0-6420","Been dipping our hands into strange cookie jars, have we? Show me what you have.",""
"149328292-0-6421","I can move anything, but I specialize in the finer things.",""
"149328292-0-6422","Don't tell me where the goods came from. This one doesn't need to know!",""
"149328292-0-6423","You weren't followed, were you? Good … good, good.",""
"149328292-0-6424","I'm in the orphaned goods business. I find new homes for lost items.",""
"149328292-0-6425","If they wanted to keep those things, they wouldn't have let them get stolen.",""
"149328292-0-6426","Don't like my prices? Good luck trying to sell that stuff elsewhere.",""
"149328292-0-6427","I'll move hot goods for you, but my rates are final.",""
"149328292-0-6428","Ooh. Making trouble, are we? Wonderful.",""
"149328292-0-6429","Don't worry. This will be our little secret.",""
"149328292-0-6430","Don't say I never gave you anything. Actually, don't say I gave you anything. To anybody.",""
"149328292-0-6431","I never saw you. You never saw me. You get me?",""
"149328292-0-6432","I'm not fond of the way these Enforcers do business, but I'm not required to look up to these clods.",""
"149328292-0-6433","Let's see what you've got. We'll do our best to get it back to its rightful owners.",""
"149328292-0-6434","You Enforcers are great. I'm thinking about leaving the Guard and joining up!",""
"149328292-0-6435","What can I help you with today, good Enforcer?",""
"149328292-0-6436","Some Enforcers treat me like a glorified clerk, but my job is important, too.",""
"149328292-0-6437","I hope you have that contraband in order. It makes my job so much easier.",""
"149328292-0-6438","Ah, Enforcer! Always happy to help!",""
"149328292-0-6439","I'll personally make sure these things are returned to their owners.",""
"149328292-0-6440","Confiscated goods. They're what I live for.",""
"149328292-0-6441","Any chance you recovered something interesting on your latest adventure?",""
"149328292-0-6442","Well, look at you! I hope you're here to see me, Enforcer.",""
"149328292-0-6443","I may work for the Guard, but I find myself attracted to the Enforcer attitude. It's so … cavalier.",""
"149328292-0-6444","Let's get this over with, Enforcer. Some of us have actual work to do.",""
"149328292-0-6445","No time for chit-chat. What can I do for you?",""
"149328292-0-6446","Some of us have to follow rules and regulations. The drink helps.",""
"149328292-0-6447","If you buy me a drink after my shift, I'll let you in on a few secrets about Guard patrols.",""
"149328292-0-6448","Got contraband? Show me what you have and we'll talk reward.",""
"149328292-0-6449","Present any confiscated goods and I'll see about your reward.",""
"149328292-0-6450","Hmm. Enforcers. Always looking for easy coin.",""
"149328292-0-6451","There are better ways to keep order than paying Enforcers for contraband.",""
"149328292-0-6452","Please, don't crowd me. One item at a time, so I can note it in the record.",""
"149328292-0-6453","Have no fear, I carefully appraise each item of contraband and derive a fair reward.",""
"149328292-0-6454","I pay top coin for contraband. I wouldn't dream of shorting you and pocketing the difference.",""
"149328292-0-6455","Money for stolen items, eh? Not a bad racket.nnContraband, I mean. Money for contraband.",""
"149328292-0-6456","If you have contraband, I have coin!",""
"149328292-0-6457","You bring me the contraband, and I'll provide the gold. Easy as that!",""
"149328292-0-6458","Impressive. So, you killed criminals to confiscate this stuff? Scary.",""
"149328292-0-6459","You have contraband for me? Because I can't give you reward if you don't have contraband.",""
"149328292-0-6460","Enforcers are so brave. I could never face down criminals every day like you do.",""
"149328292-0-6461","Oh yes, this one will give everything back to its rightful owner. Everything.",""
"149328292-0-6462","Returning stolen items is a great service. Thank you for your efforts.",""
"149328292-0-6463","If there were more honest Enforcers like you, crime would no longer be a problem.",""
"149328292-0-6464","Ah, friend! May I call you friend? You must be here about the opportunity.",""
"149328292-0-6465","Ah, you've returned! I knew you would. I had a feeling about you. Are you ready to take advantage of that opportunity now?",""
"149328292-0-6466","Just leave me. I appreciate you killing the bastards, but I couldn't escape even if I wanted to. I'm done for.",""
"149328292-0-6467","Ah, friend! May I call you friend? You've seen how the Enforcers live. Now let me tell you about a real opportunity.",""
"149328292-0-6468","Ah, you've returned! I knew you would. I had a feeling about you. You know that the opportunities are so much better on this side of the law, don't you?",""
"149328292-0-6469","So you decided to see what life was like on the other side of the law? That's no life, trust me. The Enforcers pay better and there's much less chance you'll get arrested.",""
"149328292-0-6470","Good luck out there, Enforcer. Give those outlaws a good drubbing for me.",""
"149328292-0-6472","Do not distract me. An Enforcer must always be vigilant.",""
"149328292-0-6473","Stop, criminal scum! Nobody breaks the law on my watch. Pay the fine, or I'll cut you open.",""
"149328292-0-6474","Submit to the Three, the spirits and thy lords, or you will pay with your blood.",""
"149328292-0-6475","I'll be watching you.",""
"149328292-0-6476","You dare oppose Imperial might?",""
"149328292-0-6477","Cherish my mercy, citizen. It is a rare thing.",""
"149328292-0-6478","Go. Now.",""
"149328292-0-6479","You cannot escape the righteous!",""
"149328292-0-6480","Cause no more trouble. We're watching you … scum.",""
"149328292-0-6481","You cannot end my pain.",""
"149328292-0-6482","You there! Interested in hearing about something new?",""
"149328292-0-6483","We've lost everything, everything but our lives. And in a place like this, even those have little value.",""
"149328292-0-6484","I just can't stop wondering—when did it all start to fall apart?nnI've served on the Elder Council for years. I've seen Emperors come and go, but I took it for granted that the Imperial City would be safe, that the citizens would be safe ….",""
"149328292-0-6485","I represent the Daggers. Maybe you've heard of us? My brothers are gadgeteers and I'm here to secure a contact with the Enforcers.nnWe've got a trap that didn't work too well against harpies, but how many outlaws do you know that can fly?",""
"149328292-0-6486","Outlaws will dine upon my justice this day, but they won't get any dessert!",""
"149328292-0-6487","So, stopped any interesting criminals lately? Got exciting stories to tell?",""
"149328292-0-6488","Did I tell you how I took down seven outlaws with a single arrow? It's all a matter of timing and angles. And waiting for just the right amount of breeze.",""
"149328292-0-6489","My, you put the rest of these so-called Enforcers to shame! Your bearing, that scrumptious grin playing across your lips … it makes me want to do something illegal just so you'll notice me.",""
"149328292-0-6490","I can't believe they let me join the Enforcers. I'm so excited! I can't wait to catch my first criminal.",""
"149328292-0-6491","No criminal has ever escaped my wrath. I'm just that good.",""
"149328292-0-6492","It is the duty of the chronicler to ensure our system of justice maintains its high ethical standards. That's why we watch and report on what we see. nnMost Enforcers bring honor to their profession, but there are a few rotten eggs in the nest.",""
"149328292-0-6493","I'm on the trail of a necromancer with certain … proclivities. Been traveling Tamriel looking for ""fresh corpses.""nnDisgusting.",""
"149328292-0-6494","The Commander told me it wasn't his idea to make me an Enforcer. I think he's just being modest, though.",""
"149328292-0-6495","Is there a reward for providing information about potential criminals?nnTake my neighbors, for instance. I'm certain they're up to all sorts of illegal activity, in that ramshackle eye-sore they call a home.",""
"149328292-0-6496","Most of these other Enforcers are small time. Me, I must have taken down hundreds of criminals.nnJust last year, I stopped an armed robbery with nothing but a broken lockpick and some torchbug guts.",""
"149328292-0-6497","Is there a reason you're standing close and breathing on me? Some Enforcers may like that kind of thing, but I'm not one of them.",""
"149328292-0-6498","Are they holding you here, too? They think I know something about a fence. I told them I'd seen the ghostfence, once. Now they won't let me out of their sight!nnThese Enforcers are heartless—the lot of them!",""
"149328292-0-6499","What did the law ever get me? A few scraps from the tables of the nobility?nnThe way I see it, they want us to skim off the top. Otherwise, they'd pay us more.",""
"149328292-0-6500","I provide special equipment for the Enforcers. Gear that isn't completely tested—or even safe, for that matter.nnBut when it works, it's a wonder to see!",""
"149328292-0-6501","The Dark Den sent us to keep Enforcer spirits high. Sort of a thank you from the Lord and Lady of the Den.nnIt's the least we can do for those keeping us safe from all those ruffians and hooligans.",""
"149328292-0-6502","They call me the Green Hood. I didn't ask for this. But sometimes the world needs a champion who can step up and do the right thing.nnI'm not saying I'm that hero, but I do my best.",""
"149328292-0-6503","Thane Mera isn't happy, but how are we supposed to remain sober when there's a Konunleikar going on?nnBesides, I do some of my best enforcing when I'm ineb— intox— when I'm drunk!",""
"149328292-0-6504","Are you an Enforcer? I've been trying to lodge a complaint for hours now, but nobody will listen!nnI want to put a bounty on my worthless son-in-law. That sluggard refuses to get a job. If that isn't a crime, I don't know what is!",""
"149328292-0-6505","Sometimes I can hardly believe the amount of time I wasted, stealing scraps and picking fights in the street. I'm lucky to have lived this long, really.",""
"149328292-0-6506","It's hard to earn a living when the Commander won't let me have a real weapon. Can't be too careful, he says. Not since the ""mammoth trunk incident,"" he says.nnWho knew the sword was so sharp? You make one mistake and it follows you forever!",""
"149328292-0-6507","Finish me, scum. End this … this farce. If you don't, those skulking Imperial scouts will.",""
"149328292-0-6508","Its humiliating! I came here to make amends and turn myself in. But these Enforcers won't even listen to me. Told me my bounty was too insignificant!nnWho do I have to murder to surrender around here?",""

"149328292-0-6511","Dead, alive … who cares? Only thing that matters is the sweet sound of gold clinking in my pocket.",""
"149328292-0-6512","What is wrong with you people? No-Ears George killed my father in cold blood, for naught but a pony and a saddle. I wish someone would listen to me!",""
"149328292-0-6513","Are you with the Enforcers? Have you found my goods amongst the contraband? I really need them returned, or my shop is ruined!nnHow can an honest merchant make a living with all these thieves running around? If I had the gold, I'd hire a guard!",""

"149328292-0-6515","I told him it could not be. We are from opposite banks of the same river, you see. The current is too powerful for us to overcome.",""
"149328292-0-6516","I employ the latest alchemical and arcane techniques to solve crimes and capture my bounties.nnMy fellow Enforcers find my methods strange, but they can't argue with the results. I always get my prey.",""
"149328292-0-6517","Criminals are a scourge on the face of the Summerset Isles. Is it any wonder we have Daedric Princes invading willy-nilly, when we tolerate such forces of chaos in our society?",""
"149328292-0-6518","I am here to register a formal complaint. Too many times, certain overzealous Enforcers have caused grievous bodily injury to innocents. They must know the people of Auridon shall not stand for it.",""
"149328292-0-6519","The only way to deal with a bounty is to eliminate it—with extreme prejudice. Otherwise, the criminal scum just commits the same crime again.nnMy way improves things for everyone. Well, except for the criminal.",""

"149328292-0-6522","These new Enforcers! So young, so naive! In my day, we didn't have to wait for bounties to take action. We stopped the real crimes before they occurred!nnBut now we have rules, regulations. Such a sad state of affairs.",""
"149328292-0-6523","I'm looking for a Dark Elf named Mel Adrys. Have you seen him? We came here hunting vampires together and he just ditched me.",""
"149328292-0-6524","Not all crimes are equal. Some were committed by devious masterminds of the magical arts. It's my job to read the traces of spells and track down the culprit.",""
"149328292-0-6525","I seem to have misplaced my list of bounties for the day. Again.nnHave you seen a crumpled sheet of parchment with a beverage stain? Slightly torn on one corner? Well, if you spot it, please let me know.",""
"149328292-0-6526","It wasn't enough that they killed my husband and my son. They didn't stop when they killed my dog, my cat, and my bantam guar.nnNo, they had to crush my prize-winning pumpkins as well.",""
"149328292-0-6527","Oh dear. You can't expect me to solve any crimes until I've had at least a snifter of something bracing. Need to keep the mental machinery lubricated.",""
"149328292-0-6528","It's true. I'm a master of disguise. When a job requires subterfuge and guile, I'm the one the Enforcers call. And they pay handsomely to acquire my talents. I'm in very high demand!",""
"149328292-0-6529","Oh, don't mind me, I'm just hoping to get a glimpse of my little kitty-wittens. I'm sure you've heard of him. Razum-dar? He called me ""sweetmeat"" once!",""

"149328292-0-6531","No, I'm not taking any more jobs. Don't need to. Finally made enough coin to retire. It's nothing but the good life for me from here on out.",""
"149328292-0-6532","Don't mind me. I've been tracking bounties for three days straight. I almost had them a few times, but this group is tricky. So I came in here for a moment's rest. If I doze off, give me a poke, all right?",""
"149328292-0-6533","Yes, I served in the Alliance war. Then they said I was too ""insubordinate."" Whatever that means.nnGlad I'm rid of them. Enforcing pays better, anyway.",""
"149328292-0-6534","""You're too old-fashioned,"" they said. ""The world's moved on,"" they said. ""You can't just put an arrow in a kid's eye because he stole a cheese wheel,"" they said.",""

"149328292-0-6539","Yes, I'm that Efreghar. Accidentally burn down one tree in Valenwood and it follows you everywhere! You'd think no one ever mistakenly cast a firebolt among the trees before. One or two lousy trees. Or twenty.nnStupid Green Pact.",""
"149328292-0-6540","If you know of any work, I'm all ears. I was part of a crew going to Sanguine Barrows, but our boss got cold feet and cancelled the job. I was really looking forward to extracting corpses from that graveyard.",""

"149328292-0-6542","I'm only hiding out here because I was set-up. Driven out of house and home by pernicious rumors.",""

"149328292-0-6545","I sell hundreds of poisons a year, and just because one ends up in the goblet of King Fahara'jad's taster, I'm some kind of criminal?",""
"149328292-0-6546","I'm not in this for the gold. I'm going to be the most famous thief in all of Tamriel! More famous even than Morella the Cruel.nnI just need to steal something special, something that will make me a legend. Let me know if you have any leads.",""
"149328292-0-6547","You look like a real outlaw … dangerous, desperate. I like dangerous.nnSo, what do you say? Want to find a dark corner and show me how dangerous you really are? Come on … you know you want to.",""
"149328292-0-6548","If you'd seen what I've seen, you'd do what I did.",""
"149328292-0-6549","Have you read the tales of the Green Hood? The masked Argonian hero?nnWell, I've been thinking. If there can be a heroic do-gooder, why not a masked villain? Eh? Now I just need to come up with a code-name to call myself!",""
"149328292-0-6550","I'm innocent I tell you, innocent! It wasn't me. I could never commit such a heinous crime! It was the tailless Argonian, it must have been!nnBut will the Guard listen to me? No! I'll have to find that Argonian myself.",""
"149328292-0-6551","Uh-uh. No. You did not see me here. I am invisible, and I am staying put.",""
"149328292-0-6552","Don't mind me. I'm just laying low until my next contract arrives.nnBut don't ask me any questions. If you knew who I really work for, I'd have to kill you. Literally.",""
"149328292-0-6553","We have an arrangement, the clerk and I. I provide information about my fellow nobles, their comings and goings, their valuables. Then I get the first opportunity to purchase the fruit of that seed. And at a special price, no less!",""
"149328292-0-6554","Ah, don't worry. It's just an illusion gone wrong. I'm not really a talking skeleton. nnNo, that would be preposterous. How would that even work? I mean—no windpipes.",""
"149328292-0-6555","I knew it was a Nord insult, but I never thought it was actually illegal! I refused to drink their foul mead and now I've been accused of ""milk-drinking?""nnAbsurd, I know, but I plan to remain here until the Konunleikar comes to an end.",""
"149328292-0-6556","If you like what you see and have gold to spare, I'm sure we could come to some sort of mutual arrangement. I'm off-duty, so to speak, but I'm sure I could be coaxed into service for the right … motivation.",""

"149328292-0-6558","Most of the riffraff down here seeks some amount of fame and fortune. I'm not like these hooligans. I steal for one reason and one reason only—I'm a collector. If I do wind up selling something, it's just to finance the next item for my collection.",""
"149328292-0-6559","Probably better to keep your distance. Bad luck follows me like a bull netch follows a betty. I can't even consider stealing something without the Guard showing up.nnIf I was even half-way decent at anything else, I'd quit this life in a heartbeat.",""
"149328292-0-6560","I wish all these criminals would leave my final resting place in peace. It's rude to just move in and set up shop like this.",""

"149328292-0-6562","So I had a little run-in with this farming village in the hills. They were so delicious.",""
"149328292-0-6563","When someone needs muscle for a job, they call on me. I've crossed swords with everything from guards and soldiers to monsters and Daedra, and I lived to tell the tale.nnIf you need an army, hire me and my crew. We're the best there is.",""
"149328292-0-6564","Stupid guar. Doesn't listen to a thing I say.",""

"149328292-0-6575","I'm a guard, but don't worry. I have no love of the law. As long as your patron keeps me supplied with gold and glitter, I'll make sure the rest of the Guard never touches this place.",""
"149328292-0-6576","So I told him, I said, how come when the queen sends her armies into war, that's noble, but when I burn down the barracks with everyone inside, that's a crime?",""
"149328292-0-6577","I guess you'd say I clean up messes. Make certain problems go away. I specialize in bloodstains, if you get my meaning.",""

"149328292-1-2582","How about you take a look at my wares?",""
"149328292-1-2583","You'll need equipment. Just so happens I have some I could sell you.",""
"149328292-1-2584","General Aklash keeps finding excuses to keep me from going out on patrol. Something tells me she prefers to watch me patrol back and forth in here.",""

"149328292-1-2606","You'll regret coming here, mortal!",""

"149328292-1-2608","Back again, little rat?",""
"149328292-1-2609","If you've come to kill me, please make it quick.",""

"149328292-1-2919","May your nose remain cleansed.",""
"149328292-1-2920","Poor choice, knave!",""
"149328292-1-2921","You are a criminal. You owe a bounty. Pay me and perhaps your deplorable condition will improve.",""
"149328292-1-2922","A bounty paid? Who would have thought it?",""
"149328292-1-2923","Let your death be on your own head!",""
"149328292-1-2924","On the matter of your criminal behavior, I will gladly accept your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-2925","Another bounty dealt with. What a good day!",""
"149328292-1-2926","I did not want it to come to this!",""
"149328292-1-2927","Bounty? Do I owe you a bounty? No, no, that cannot be right. It must be the other way around.",""
"149328292-1-2928","Crime? I have no idea what you mean.",""
"149328292-1-2929","This is probably all your fault!",""
"149328292-1-2930","You are making my head pound, criminal! Just pay your bounty and away with you!",""
"149328292-1-2931","Another criminal has purchased justice.",""
"149328292-1-2932","I am in no mood for your shenanigans!",""
"149328292-1-2933","Your illicit activities have a cost, lawbreaker, and that cost is judgment!",""
"149328292-1-2934","Perhaps there is hope for you.",""
"149328292-1-2935","You would run from justice? Never!",""
"149328292-1-2936","I will not read your charges. You would doze off before I finish. Pay your bounty and be on your way.",""
"149328292-1-2937","Thank you for making restitution.",""
"149328292-1-2938","You made me raise my voice, felon!",""
"149328292-1-2939","I caught you. Just pay me the bounty. I will bring it to the ... appropriate parties.",""
"149328292-1-2940","A little light. Eh, it will do.",""
"149328292-1-2941","Foolish. Very foolish.",""
"149328292-1-2942","Yesterday, a criminal tried to run. Had to take his feet. Not pleasant! Why not just pay the bounty?",""
"149328292-1-2943","There you go. A clean slate.",""
"149328292-1-2944","Oh well. This is what they pay me for.",""
"149328292-1-2945","Justice can be invigorating if you pay your bounty with a smile!",""
"149328292-1-2946","See? Was that so bad?",""
"149328292-1-2947","Now we must fight. A shame!",""
"149328292-1-2948","Another day, another witless oaf disrupting the peace .... Pay your bounty or suffer the consequences.",""
"149328292-1-2949","Do not let me see you again.",""
"149328292-1-2950","Impudent swine!",""
"149328292-1-2951","Real law enforcement is so boring. Why stop crimes when you can just stand around demanding bounties?",""
"149328292-1-2952","Great. Let's do this again some time.",""
"149328292-1-2953","Suicide by Guard? So be it!",""
"149328292-1-2954","I'm not a judge or a jury. I'm just here to collect your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-2955","I suppose we're done here. Move along.",""
"149328292-1-2956","One of us will regret this!",""
"149328292-1-2957","Your crime is like a blockage in the river of your soul. I can clear it up if you pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-2958","Every time a debt is paid, a torchbug sings.",""
"149328292-1-2959","You were hatched from a rotten egg!",""
"149328292-1-2960","Your crimes are known. Pay the bounty or suffer the fangs.",""
"149328292-1-2961","Good. Now, don't make ripples.",""
"149328292-1-2962","Now I'm angry!",""
"149328292-1-2963","Why did you have to break the law? Now you have to pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-1-2964","What's this? Oh, the bounty. Right!",""
"149328292-1-2965","I'll tell my superior about this!",""
"149328292-1-2966","You break the law, I break your jaw. Unless you pay the bounty of course.",""
"149328292-1-2967","No snappy come-back? Too bad.",""
"149328292-1-2968","Finally, some action!",""
"149328292-1-2969","You're a criminal. And I'm not as thunk as you drink I am. Wait ....",""
"149328292-1-2970","Bounty collected! Drinks are on me. No, not your drink ....",""
"149328292-1-2971","Now you've done it!",""
"149328292-1-2972","Have you seen an outlaw around here? I'm supposed to collect a bounty, but I can't seem to ... oh, it's you!",""
"149328292-1-2973","Crime? What crime? You're free to go.",""
"149328292-1-2974","Didn't I ask for your surrender?",""
"149328292-1-2975","You should be careful. I'm an egg on a precipice and I'm about to crack!",""
"149328292-1-2976","Paid in full. Good, good. Paid in full.",""
"149328292-1-2977","You crossed the wrong guard, felon!",""
"149328292-1-2978","Well met! I know you plan to pay your fine. I'm here to accommodate your needs.",""
"149328292-1-2979","A pleasure clearing your record.",""
"149328292-1-2980","I tried to be nice about this!",""
"149328292-1-2981","I do hope you're not a violent sort. I much prefer to deal with civilized lawbreakers.",""
"149328292-1-2982","Another bounty paid in quick fashion.",""
"149328292-1-2983","Fleeing was a grievous error!",""
"149328292-1-2984","Uh, yeah, that's right. I represent the town guard. So, uh, pay the bounty, all right?",""
"149328292-1-2985","Don't tell anyone you saw me, all right?",""
"149328292-1-2986","Can't we work something out?",""
"149328292-1-2987","Sometimes the law moves at the speed of mud flowing uphill. If you pay now, I'd be grateful.",""
"149328292-1-2988","I knew you were going to cooperate.",""
"149328292-1-2989","Why did you try to run?",""
"149328292-1-2990","You did some crime. Now you pay a bounty.",""
"149328292-1-2991","What's this for? Oh yeah.",""
"149328292-1-2992","Should have paid the bounty!",""
"149328292-1-2993","Go ahead. Don't pay your bounty. That would make my day. I'm just itching to hit something.",""
"149328292-1-2994","Criminals have no spine.",""
"149328292-1-2995","You're leaving? Over my dead body!",""
"149328292-1-2996","I am drawn by your musk, but also by my duty. Please. Do not make me scar such a pretty face.",""
"149328292-1-2997","Farewell, luscious flower.",""
"149328292-1-2998","The grass waves in the wind. I do not.",""
"149328292-1-2999","I don't mean to--I mean, I know you're busy--but you have a bounty on your head that needs paying.",""
"149328292-1-3000","Oh good. I was worried that would go roots up.",""
"149328292-1-3001","Stop! I--I mean it!",""
"149328292-1-3002","Want to see a trick? You give me gold, and I forget I ever saw you.",""
"149328292-1-3003","Pleasure doing business.",""
"149328292-1-3004","You suicidal, or just crazy?",""
"149328292-1-3005","I prefer you don't pay your bounty. Then, according to the law, the bone breaking can begin.",""
"149328292-1-3006","Your slate's clean, but I'll be watching.",""
"149328292-1-3007","Yield, or I'll scoop out your brains!",""
"149328292-1-3008","You have turned deplorable into an art form! I'm not worthy to collect a bounty from you.",""
"149328292-1-3009","I wish you well with your newfound freedom.",""
"149328292-1-3010","I thought we had an understanding!",""
"149328292-1-3011","You're not going to try something, are you? Look, just pay your bounty and be on your way.",""
"149328292-1-3012","On your way. Try not to do it again.",""
"149328292-1-3013","You won't get far!",""
"149328292-1-3014","Justice catches up with us all eventually. Do yourself a favor and pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3015","Smart move. It's unwise to resist fate.",""
"149328292-1-3016","It had to end this way: you versus me.",""
"149328292-1-3017","I've come to collect something. Give me a moment. Oh, yes! The bounty! For your crimes and all.",""
"149328292-1-3018","Your slate is clean, so I guess we're done here.",""
"149328292-1-3019","This is your last warning! No, this is!",""
"149328292-1-3020","You're a lawbreaker, and I'm the law. Now pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3021","Move along.",""
"149328292-1-3022","To arms!",""
"149328292-1-3023","I wonder ... if it's not too much trouble ... could I get you to pay your bounty now?",""
"149328292-1-3024","Bounty paid in full? How ... unexpected.",""
"149328292-1-3025","I must insist you surrender!",""
"149328292-1-3026","The Anti-Criminality Act, Section II, Subsection B states: Criminals must pay a bounty commensurate to their crimes.",""
"149328292-1-3027","Good. Now to file the paperwork.",""
"149328292-1-3028","Fleeing a crime is also illegal!",""
"149328292-1-3029","Are you the violent sort? You don't look violent. I really hate dealing with violent criminals.",""
"149328292-1-3030","That worked out better than usual.",""
"149328292-1-3031","Try not to hurt me too badly!",""
"149328292-1-3032","By Y'ffre's lush branches, justice is a spiritual experience! Will you pray with me and pay your fine?",""
"149328292-1-3033","The gods smile on those who pay their debts!",""
"149328292-1-3034","Yield, villain, or suffer mightily!",""
"149328292-1-3035","Look, I've heard it all before. Just pay your bounty and be on your way.",""
"149328292-1-3036","Good. Off with you. Keep your nose clean.",""
"149328292-1-3037","I'm not even on duty!",""
"149328292-1-3038","I usually deal with a higher class of criminal, but I suppose I can accept your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3039","I applaud your good sense! The bounty is paid!",""
"149328292-1-3040","Make no mistake, you'll regret this!",""
"149328292-1-3041","Listen, I don't want to be the bad guy here. Just pay the bounty and everyone's happy.",""
"149328292-1-3042","Great. Now, we can all get some rest.",""
"149328292-1-3043","Let's get this over with!",""
"149328292-1-3044","How did you hope to get away with this? Are you from the moons?",""
"149328292-1-3045","Huh. I thought you weren't going to pay.",""
"149328292-1-3046","I gave you a chance!",""
"149328292-1-3047","Sometimes I wonder, what's the point? You're just going to go out and break the law again.",""
"149328292-1-3048","It's just a matter of time, but you'll be back.",""
"149328292-1-3049","I knew this would happen.",""
"149328292-1-3050","I believe we can clear up this situation as soon as you pay the proper bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3051","I have cleared your record and restored your good name.",""
"149328292-1-3052","Resist and this will go harder on you.",""
"149328292-1-3053","Let's play a little game. I catch you and collect your bounty. Then you. Catch. Me.",""
"149328292-1-3054","Pleasure doing business with you.",""
"149328292-1-3055","So you want to play rough, do you?",""
"149328292-1-3056","Wouldn't it be great to just start over with a clean slate? All you have to do is give up the gold.",""
"149328292-1-3057","I think that went well for both of us.",""
"149328292-1-3058","Last mistake you'll make!",""
"149328292-1-3059","You have strayed from the path of virtue, but you can still find your way back. Pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3060","I will pray for your redemption.",""
"149328292-1-3061","I will pray for your soul.",""
"149328292-1-3062","I can't help but notice you're armed. Um … would you be willing to pay your bounty?",""
"149328292-1-3063","Thank the Divines! You paid!",""
"149328292-1-3064","Stop, criminal! Please stop!",""
"149328292-1-3065","You've shown us what a tremendous criminal you are--now show us what an upstanding citizen you can be!",""
"149328292-1-3066","Thank you! It was a pleasure.",""
"149328292-1-3067","You're smarter than this!",""
"149328292-1-3068","Every crime carries a cost. Lucky for you, I am a duly appointed bounty collector.",""
"149328292-1-3069","In accordance with the law, your bounty has been paid.",""
"149328292-1-3070","I will note this in your record!",""
"149328292-1-3071","You're stuck, criminal. Cornered. So pay the bounty and I'll let you move on.",""
"149328292-1-3072","Hmph.",""
"149328292-1-3073","You're not going anywhere!",""
"149328292-1-3074","Your deplorable actions have a cost, and that cost is justice!",""
"149328292-1-3075","Go and steal no more, felon!",""
"149328292-1-3076","Escape is not an option!",""
"149328292-1-3077","Please. This doesn't have to get ugly. Just pay your bounty and we can both walk away.",""
"149328292-1-3078","Gods. That was easier than I thought.",""
"149328292-1-3079","Oh gods! I don't want to die.",""
"149328292-1-3080","You made a mistake. Things happen. Let me help you clear this up. Can you pay your fine?",""
"149328292-1-3081","Don't you feel better now?",""
"149328292-1-3082","Well, if you want a fight ....",""
"149328292-1-3083","There's no need for violence. Simply pay the bounty and you're free to go. Easy, right?",""
"149328292-1-3084","Excellent. Now you be smart, all right?",""
"149328292-1-3085","This could have been so easy!",""
"149328292-1-3086","Just a minute. Your crimes are known here, and I would see your bounty collected.",""
"149328292-1-3087","All right. Carry on.",""
"149328292-1-3088","You're forcing my hand!",""
"149328292-1-3089","I don't care why you did it. Pay your bounty and you're free to go.",""
"149328292-1-3090","Try not to do it again, would you?",""
"149328292-1-3091","You shouldn't have done that!",""
"149328292-1-3092","I can tell you're full of crime. Give me some coin, Crimey. I'll let you go, I swear.",""
"149328292-1-3093","On your way, then.",""
"149328292-1-3094","I've fought better than you!",""
"149328292-1-3095","We can sweep all this down the kwama hole for the right price ....",""
"149328292-1-3096","Better not have short-changed me.",""
"149328292-1-3097","Brave! Stupid, but brave.",""
"149328292-1-3098","You don't look like you can afford to pay your bounty. No way you have enough gold.",""
"149328292-1-3099","I suppose you're free to go now.",""
"149328292-1-3100","I suppose you are a criminal after all!",""
"149328292-1-3101","No one escapes justice, you malcontent! Now pay your bounty!",""
"149328292-1-3102","Another contrite criminal makes amends!",""
"149328292-1-3103","Have at thee, villain!",""
"149328292-1-3104","There's nothing I'd like more than to gut you, but I'm supposed to ask you to pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3105","Fine. But next time I won't be so nice.",""
"149328292-1-3106","You're not going anywhere!",""
"149328292-1-3107","Pay the bounty ... if scum like you even has that kind of money.",""
"149328292-1-3108","This money's filthy.",""
"149328292-1-3109","Another runner. What did I expect?",""
"149328292-1-3110","Yes, I know. I make this uniform look good. Now stop staring and pay me your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3111","Now see. That wasn't so bad!",""
"149328292-1-3112","And now the inevitable begins!",""
"149328292-1-3113","Your bounty now, if you please.",""
"149328292-1-3114","Thank you.",""
"149328292-1-3115","You defied the law for the last time!",""
"149328292-1-3116","Let us do this by the rules. Pay your bounty and you can remain free.",""
"149328292-1-3117","Go on. I don't want to be seen with you.",""
"149328292-1-3118","You should have submitted!",""
"149328292-1-3119","Please, no explanations. I don't care why you did what you did. I just need you to pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3120","Almsivi be praised.",""
"149328292-1-3121","You brought this on your own head!",""
"149328292-1-3122","A dark day indeed when I have to deal with the likes of you. Pay your bounty and leave me be.",""
"149328292-1-3123","Next time, commit your crimes elsewhere.",""
"149328292-1-3124","Why do they always want to fight me?",""
"149328292-1-3125","Yet another useless s'wit of a criminal to waste my time. Give me the bounty and go.",""
"149328292-1-3126","Please. Just obey the law from now on!",""
"149328292-1-3127","You people make me mad!",""
"149328292-1-3128","Neither of us is happy with this situation. Just pay your bounty and we can be on our way.",""
"149328292-1-3129","The scales have been balanced.",""
"149328292-1-3130","I knew I should've brought my other weapon!",""
"149328292-1-3131","Your deeds are an affront to the gods! Pay the bounty or die.",""
"149328292-1-3132","Go, and turn away from your error.",""
"149328292-1-3133","Gods have mercy on this fool!",""
"149328292-1-3134","I'm not here to threaten you, so let's just keep this friendly. Can I take your bounty?",""
"149328292-1-3135","Wait. You're actually giving in? That's great!",""
"149328292-1-3136","No, please! I want my mother!",""
"149328292-1-3137","Scum like you belongs on the bottom of my boot. Irks me just to look at you. Just pay and go.",""
"149328292-1-3138","Fine. Now get your stink away from me.",""
"149328292-1-3139","You're hardly worth the effort!",""
"149328292-1-3140","This is your lucky day! Pay me your bounty and I'll make sure no one bothers you again.",""
"149328292-1-3141","Bounty? Sure, we can call it that.",""
"149328292-1-3142","Why do criminals never trust me?",""
"149328292-1-3143","The criminal mind rarely learns--justice always comes calling.",""
"149328292-1-3144","A predictable result.",""
"149328292-1-3145","The criminal is a boundless enigma!",""
"149328292-1-3146","This one knows how you suffer, always on the run. Pay your bounty and this can all be over.",""
"149328292-1-3147","This one appreciates your good sense.",""
"149328292-1-3148","This one expected you to do that!",""
"149328292-1-3149","You've been caught committing crimes against society. You will pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3150","You are right with the law once more.",""
"149328292-1-3151","Don't you dare run from me!",""
"149328292-1-3152","This does not need to escalate. Simply pay the bounty and you'll go free.",""
"149328292-1-3153","Peace. Your debt is paid.",""
"149328292-1-3154","It is unwise to flee.",""
"149328292-1-3155","This one likes dealing with the lawless types. Pay your bounty and then we can discuss your punishment, yes?",""
"149328292-1-3156","Stay fragrant, my criminal.",""
"149328292-1-3157","So you want to play hard to get?",""
"149328292-1-3158","A criminal caught in the act. Such a dilemma. But I can help, for the right price.",""
"149328292-1-3159","I knew you'd come around.",""
"149328292-1-3160","You're trying to run? How cute!",""
"149328292-1-3161","You were bad, so now you must pay, yes?",""
"149328292-1-3162","Go. But try not to get caught again, yes?",""
"149328292-1-3163","This one won't warn you again, criminal!",""
"149328292-1-3164","This one is pleased to meet such a distinguished scoundrel. Will you pay your bounty now?",""
"149328292-1-3165","The law accepts your restitution, friend!",""
"149328292-1-3166","I challenge you, criminal!",""
"149328292-1-3167","This one apologizes in advance, but the question must be asked. Will you pay your bounty?",""
"149328292-1-3168","You paid your bounty? Well done!",""
"149328292-1-3169","Why wouldn't you surrender?",""
"149328292-1-3170","Pay your bounty or give this one a reason to hurt you. Perhaps this one needs no reason, yes?",""
"149328292-1-3171","What? Your bounty's paid. Move along.",""
"149328292-1-3172","No surrender? Then let us dance!",""
"149328292-1-3173","You think you're so smart, yes? Not smart enough, it seems. Come now, make this easier for everyone.",""
"149328292-1-3174","Bleh! This one needs a bath!",""
"149328292-1-3175","Smelly and stupid? So be it!",""
"149328292-1-3176","Our laws demand a coin-settlement to clear your name. Render payment or things will go badly for you.",""
"149328292-1-3177","Your compliance is appreciated.",""
"149328292-1-3178","You elect to fight? So be it!",""
"149328292-1-3179","This one is a guard, truly! Look at my fancy uniform! So hand over your bounty or ... uhm ... justice!",""
"149328292-1-3180","Yes, this will do nicely.",""
"149328292-1-3181","You will pay dearly for that!",""
"149328292-1-3182","Crime has consequences, lawbreaker. I will have that bounty now.",""
"149328292-1-3183","This one thanks you for your cooperation.",""
"149328292-1-3184","Was I not clear? Surrender!",""
"149328292-1-3185","Pay your bounty or I break your legs. Maybe an arm, if you cause me trouble.",""
"149328292-1-3186","This one will be watching you, felon.",""
"149328292-1-3187","Violence? My second favorite activity!",""
"149328292-1-3188","Pay up, muskarse.",""
"149328292-1-3189","Now go.",""
"149328292-1-3190","You're dead!",""
"149328292-1-3191","This isn't about innocence or guilt. You have a bounty for crimes committed and I must collect it.",""
"149328292-1-3192","I appreciate you taking this so well.",""
"149328292-1-3193","So be it!",""
"149328292-1-3194","A little corruption never hurt anyone, but I still need to collect your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3195","Go and break no laws. You're free.",""
"149328292-1-3196","Violence? I can do violence!",""
"149328292-1-3197","What's that smell? Oh yeah, a stinking criminal. Pay the bounty. And take a bath.",""
"149328292-1-3198","Worthless scum.",""
"149328292-1-3199","Guess I have to kill you now!",""
"149328292-1-3200","My feet hurt, villain. Pay and be about your business.",""
"149328292-1-3201","You paid your bounty and are free to go.",""
"149328292-1-3202","Don't make me beat you, thief!",""
"149328292-1-3203","Pay or suffer, villain!",""
"149328292-1-3204","The felon has made restitution!",""
"149328292-1-3205","Die, rogue!",""
"149328292-1-3206","What's this, a ne'er-do-well out on the prowl? Come now, you've got bills to pay.",""
"149328292-1-3207","Well played. Now scoot.",""
"149328292-1-3208","It's your funeral, sweetroll!",""
"149328292-1-3209","I love dealing with the criminal element. Will you pay your bounty and clear your record?",""
"149328292-1-3210","Another bounty, cheerfully collected!",""
"149328292-1-3211","You want a fight? Very well!",""
"149328292-1-3212","You have been accused of a crime and I am authorized to demand you pay bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3213","The law is satisfied.",""
"149328292-1-3214","I am now authorized to attack!",""
"149328292-1-3215","Give me some gold and I'll let you off the hook, no questions asked.",""
"149328292-1-3216","Off you go, friend.",""
"149328292-1-3217","I'm not drunk enough for this!",""
"149328292-1-3218","You know what would make my foul mood even worse? If you decide not to pay your bounty!",""
"149328292-1-3219","You disappoint me, lawbreaker.",""
"149328292-1-3220","You've angered the mammoth, troll-bait!",""
"149328292-1-3221","No need for concern. Pay the bounty and your name will be cleared.",""
"149328292-1-3222","You did good, settling your affairs.",""
"149328292-1-3223","All right, you'll pay in blood!",""
"149328292-1-3224","I've come to ask ... I mean, demand your bounty. Yeah, demand. So pay up ... please?",""
"149328292-1-3225","Great! Thank you. Seriously ... thank you.",""
"149328292-1-3226","Wait! We can still work this out!",""
"149328292-1-3227","Don't tell me your story. I don't want to hear it. I just want to collect your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3228","I expect we'll see each other again.",""
"149328292-1-3229","Didn't want to kill you, but oh well!",""
"149328292-1-3230","Paying a bounty's not so bad. Think of it as unintended charity. The people thank you! Honestly!",""
"149328292-1-3231","Painless, eh? Now, off you go.",""
"149328292-1-3232","We're fighting? Well, all right!",""
"149328292-1-3233","Where have you been hiding all my life? If we clear your name, maybe we can talk of other things.",""
"149328292-1-3234","I'll see you again, my little snowball.",""
"149328292-1-3235","I didn't want it to come to this!",""
"149328292-1-3236","Looks like you broke some law or other. I believe this means you have to pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3237","That's right. I think.",""
"149328292-1-3238","You'll never get away with ... whatever you did!",""
"149328292-1-3239","Don't mess with me. Captain's breathing down my neck to collect a bounty, and you're the one.",""
"149328292-1-3240","Far as I'm concerned, this didn't happen.",""
"149328292-1-3241","No wonder you got caught!",""
"149328292-1-3242","You don't have to pay a bounty. Your name is clear and you're free to go. Ha! No, really, pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3243","We should do this again sometime.",""
"149328292-1-3244","Death by justice? So that's your game!",""
"149328292-1-3245","Nice try, runt! Now you can pay the bounty in coin or teeth--what's it gonna be?",""
"149328292-1-3246","Good. Now get out of my sight.",""
"149328292-1-3247","You asked for it!",""
"149328292-1-3248","You dumb or something? Only dumb folks do crime. Now pay up!",""
"149328292-1-3249","Good. Now beat it.",""
"149328292-1-3250","Where do you think you're going?",""
"149328292-1-3251","You'll run, I'm sure. But I still have to ask you to pay the fine.",""
"149328292-1-3252","That's over with then.",""
"149328292-1-3253","This again!",""
"149328292-1-3254","Hold on. I have your name right here. Somewhere. Stupid bounty sheets! Always getting mixed up!",""
"149328292-1-3255","I hope that's enough to cover the fine.",""
"149328292-1-3256","That's it! I quit! After this fight.",""
"149328292-1-3257","The law is an army. Resist and it will overwhelm you. So pay me your bounty ... or prepare for battle.",""
"149328292-1-3258","Your record is clear. For now.",""
"149328292-1-3259","A fool and his head are soon parted!",""
"149328292-1-3260","Oh, that's handy. I just spent my last gold at the tavern. Your bounty will buy me another drink.",""
"149328292-1-3261","All right. Maybe just one more drink ....",""
"149328292-1-3262","Stay still and let me hit you!",""
"149328292-1-3263","You smell amazing. Please pay your bounty so I don't have to hurt your pretty face.",""
"149328292-1-3264","Farewell, luscious tuber!",""
"149328292-1-3265","I'd hoped we could come to a different arrangement!",""
"149328292-1-3266","Pay your bounty or don't. It's all the same in the end.",""
"149328292-1-3267","I expect we'll see each other again.",""
"149328292-1-3268","Your fate is sealed, lawbreaker!",""
"149328292-1-3269","All right, you did the crime so now you've got to pay the fine. Like it matters ....",""
"149328292-1-3270","Hrmph. Whatever.",""
"149328292-1-3271","Ugh, I don't need this!",""
"149328292-1-3272","You left witnesses. Amateur mistake--and it's going to cost you.",""
"149328292-1-3273","Good. Now get lost.",""
"149328292-1-3274","Dumb, dumb, dumb!",""
"149328292-1-3275","For a criminal, you don't seem like such a bad person. Can I collect your bounty now?",""
"149328292-1-3276","Why'd you give me all this gold again?",""
"149328292-1-3277","Finally! I love this part!",""
"149328292-1-3278","I catch everyone who runs. Except for the one last night. But you're slower--I'd catch you.",""
"149328292-1-3279","On your way. Don't let me see you again.",""
"149328292-1-3280","Toothless dog! You'll pay for that!",""
"149328292-1-3281","We had a fine chase, but the time has come to pay for your crimes!",""
"149328292-1-3282","I look forward to collecting from you again!",""
"149328292-1-3283","You really think you can beat me?",""
"149328292-1-3284","I can take your bounty, or I can take your head. I'll even let you choose.",""
"149328292-1-3285","Thanks for nothing, coward.",""
"149328292-1-3286","I hope you fight better than you smell.",""
"149328292-1-3287","Bounty. Pay me. Now.",""
"149328292-1-3288","Well done, insect. Go, fly away.",""
"149328292-1-3289","This is on your head!",""
"149328292-1-3290","The criminal mind is incapable of learning from past mistakes. So I am here to remind you to pay up.",""
"149328292-1-3291","I predicted this result.",""
"149328292-1-3292","I predicted this result!",""
"149328292-1-3293","I will slice the skin from your bones if you decide not to pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3294","Next time I shall require blood as well as gold.",""
"149328292-1-3295","This won't take long, scum!",""
"149328292-1-3296","Your crimes have been recognized. Now pay your bounty as required.",""
"149328292-1-3297","You are back in the law's good graces.",""
"149328292-1-3298","How dare you flee from the law!",""
"149328292-1-3299","Peace to you. I entreat you to abandon this criminal lifestyle. Pay the bounty and go free.",""
"149328292-1-3300","Your compliance avails you well.",""
"149328292-1-3301","You chose this path, not I!",""
"149328292-1-3302","You're caught. Pay up.",""
"149328292-1-3303","Go.",""
"149328292-1-3304","Wrong answer!",""
"149328292-1-3305","The shifting sands slip through my fingers, and so can you if you pay your fine.",""
"149328292-1-3306","Go in peace, my friend.",""
"149328292-1-3307","I will defeat you, lawbreaker!",""
"149328292-1-3308","Face facts. You were caught in the act. But I can help clear your name ... for a price.",""
"149328292-1-3309","Cross this one off my list.",""
"149328292-1-3310","Resistance. How unfortunate!",""
"149328292-1-3311","Pay the bounty or I'll beat you senseless. I might beat you senseless anyway.",""
"149328292-1-3312","Smart.",""
"149328292-1-3313","You'll be slain on sight!",""
"149328292-1-3314","I'm not one of those hard-edged angry guards. I know it's hard out there. But the law's the law.",""
"149328292-1-3315","Thank you kindly.",""
"149328292-1-3316","Cease and desist!",""
"149328292-1-3317","Too slow--and it will cost you.",""
"149328292-1-3318","Hmph. Off with you.",""
"149328292-1-3319","Prepare to die!",""
"149328292-1-3320","Remit the bounty for your transgressions immediately.",""
"149328292-1-3321","A wise choice.",""
"149328292-1-3322","That was poorly considered!",""
"149328292-1-3323","You're better than this, friend. Here--just pay your fine. You'll feel a lot better, trust me.",""
"149328292-1-3324","Excellent. Thanks for cooperating.",""
"149328292-1-3325","Take a breath and reconsider this!",""
"149328292-1-3326","Oh, look. A criminal genius. I'd be impressed, but you look so … ordinary. Now pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-1-3327","The son of a goblinspawn has paid in full.",""
"149328292-1-3328","Another cur wants to fight!",""
"149328292-1-3329","Abide me, wayfarer, and pay your bounty. It is the right thing to do.",""
"149328292-1-3330","Peace be upon you, released one.",""
"149328292-1-3331","Let this be on your head!",""
"149328292-1-3332","Crime has consequences, lawbreaker. I will take that bounty now.",""
"149328292-1-3333","Thank you for being so cooperative.",""
"149328292-1-3334","Your mistake is your undoing!",""
"149328292-1-3335","Your suffering is over fool, die!",""
"149328292-1-3336","It costs you nothing to look.",""
"149328292-1-3337","I've got just what you need.",""
"149328292-1-3338","Looking for a bargain?",""
"149328292-1-3339","Well aren't you a sight for some tired, old eyes? Where in Oblivion is the city guard? nnThere are all these troublemakers causing trouble out in the streets. Are you going to tell them to settle down?",""
"149328292-1-3340","Oh! Here comes the cavalry! My father swore he'd come back for me—just went to get the horses, he said, fobbing bastard.nnI bet he left me on purpose. Only now he feels guilty, so he sent you, didn't he?",""
"149328292-1-3341","I hear you put the girl Voria's mind at ease in the Elven Gardens. Thank you for doing that. If we can improve things, even a little bit at a time, hope will return.",""
"149328292-1-3342","I heard a commotion coming from the Arena District. I might just have to sneak over there and see what's going on.",""
"149328292-1-3343","I have seen the thralls of Molag Bal before, but the magics driving Legion Zero are a mystery to me. I find myself at a loss.",""
"149328292-1-3344","I follow the Bloodmist Master. I do not question his choices.",""
"149328292-1-3345","I will not go hungry.",""
"149328292-1-3346","There may still be good prey up in the city.",""
"149328292-1-3347","These Covenant Orcs are cowards and fools.",""
"149328292-1-3348","The blood of the Daedra is foul, and they can return for revenge.",""
"149328292-1-3349","Mmm. Cat-flesh. Khajiit blood is so sweet.",""
"149328292-1-3350","Once my training is complete, the ways of the Blood Mist are mine.",""
"149328292-1-3351","I swear myself to no husband. I serve the Bloodmist Master.",""
"149328292-1-3352","The daedrats taunt me. This one refuses to give in to temptation.",""
"149328292-1-3353","Whatever became of that General?",""
"149328292-1-3354","When I find who's fouled my canteen, they're getting an arrow in the neck.",""
"149328292-1-3355","What do you mean? I'm the best soldier in the squad.",""
"149328292-1-3356","Do you think they'll make us go to Coldharbour? I hate those portals.",""
"149328292-1-3357","A provincial soldier heard me, but she's dead now, so no worries.",""
"149328292-1-3358","Hold fast, kyn. The mortals approach.",""
"149328292-1-3359","The breaches must hold.",""
"149328292-1-3360","Death is a mercy to them.",""
"149328292-1-3361","Bring me their fears, and I will exploit them.",""
"149328292-1-3362","Beware the counter-attack.",""
"149328292-1-3363","Like our Dark Lord, I punish the weak and reward the strong.",""
"149328292-1-3364","Bested in combat by a mortal? Surely you are making a joke.",""
"149328292-1-3365","Bring it to me. Let me look into its eyes.",""
"149328292-1-3366","Empires rise and fall, but the sewers remain.",""
"149328292-1-3367","These Dremora are naught but a poor imitation of Lord Dagon's servants. We are Molag Bal's true children.",""
"149328292-1-3368","The mortal need for sanitation is quaint.",""
"149328292-1-3369","We crack the center of the Mundus, split the veil wide, and Coldharbour will swallow it whole.",""
"149328292-1-3370","We hold the capital. When do we strike at the provinces?",""
"149328292-1-3371","We hold the capital. When do we strike at the provinces?",""
"149328292-1-3373","I'm watching you, troublemaker.",""
"149328292-1-3375","Not my problem.",""
"149328292-1-3376","Put that weapon away!",""
"149328292-1-3377","Guard!",""
"149328292-1-3378","I can't believe you did  that!",""
"149328292-1-3379","Ugh, a common criminal.",""
"149328292-1-3380","There's a killer on the loose!",""

"149328292-1-3384","What exactly do you think you're doing?",""
"149328292-1-3385","You just stole that. I saw you!",""
"149328292-1-3386","There's a vampire among us!",""

"149328292-1-6448","Gold for contraband. Simple as that.",""
"149328292-1-6449","The Guard pays top coin for contraband. We call it a ""finder's fee.""",""

"149328292-1-6455","Wouldn't I like to bash a few criminals over the skull, like you do. Must be nice, emptying their pockets.",""
"149328292-1-6456","I don't know how we kept the peace without you Enforcers around!",""
"149328292-1-6457","You're doing good work, Enforcer. Theft and murder have no place in society!",""
"149328292-1-6458","Um, right. Gold for contraband. You don't have to tell me twice.",""
"149328292-1-6459","All those criminals you kill … it must weigh on you Enforcers.nnI, uh, I didn't mean anything by that. Do you have any contraband?",""

"149328292-1-6469","Honestly, I'm not angry. I'm disappointed. I know it can be hard to walk the narrow precipice of lawfulness, but I thought we were friends.",""

"149328292-2-3233","No one as attractive as you could be a criminal! Let me help you clear your record, all right?",""
"149328292-2-3236","Stop, criminal. Pay the bounty or ... or ... I always forget what comes next.",""
"149328292-2-3239","The law says I have to stop you, but that's it. Just give me the money and you can keep walking.",""

"149328292-2-3254","Why do I always have to deal with the ugly criminals? Just pay your bounty and get lost.",""
"149328292-2-3257","Do I look like I'm the patient sort to you? Then why haven't you paid your bounty yet?",""
"149328292-2-3260","Mauloch's nethers! This is some drinking game. A bottle of ale after every bounty? Here we go again.",""
"149328292-2-3263","For a criminal, I find you rather attractive. I wish we could meet under different circumstances.",""
"149328292-2-3266","The criminal breaks the law. The guard demands a bounty. It's all so … trivial. But you still owe a bounty, criminal.",""
"149328292-2-3269","Pay up, chump. I don't set the fines, I just collect them. So complain to someone else.",""
"149328292-2-3272","Nobody breaks the law around here without consulting me first. Remember that next time. Now pay up.",""

"149328292-2-3281","Poor decisions often war with common sense. Time to declare a cease fire and pay your bounty!",""
"149328292-2-3284","Are you going to cry, you tuskless runt? That gold better not be soggy when you pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-2-3287","Quiet, you honorless cur! I want your bounty and I want it now.",""
"149328292-2-3290","The book of law sets clear guidelines on what's next. You pay your bounty or you face the axe.",""
"149328292-2-3293","I will cut the eyes from your head and toss them to the dogs if you decide not to pay your fine.",""
"149328292-2-3296","This is not a request. Make restitution for your crimes. Now.",""
"149328292-2-3299","It's not my wish to punish you, only to collect what the law demands.",""
"149328292-2-3302","Going somewhere? You've got a fine to pay.",""
"149328292-2-3305","I have nothing to prove. You have everything to lose. Better to pay your fine and be done with it.",""
"149328292-2-3308","I love catching the ones who deem themselves clever. It amuses me to make them pay.",""
"149328292-2-3311","Do you know what I do to criminals who don't pay their bounty? You don't want to.",""
"149328292-2-3314","This will all go down a lot easier if neither of us gets emotional. Just pay the fine.",""
"149328292-2-3317","I've come for your bounty. Pay it or die.",""
"149328292-2-3320","Cease your wrongdoings, scoundrel. A bounty has been levied on your misbegotten head.",""

"149328292-2-3332","I've come to collect your bounty, criminal. Resist me at your own peril.",""
"149328292-2-3335","You have been weighed and judged. Now die!",""

"149328292-2-3342","Your little general's been real quiet ever since you captured the district. nnI guess he got what he wanted and dropped me like a sack of spoiled meat. I hate it when men do that to me.",""
"149328292-2-3343","This corruption must be cleansed. I'll burn this whole city down if that's what it takes. Better to burn than be ruled by Daedra.",""

"149328292-3-794","My mother told me not to go to sea!",""
"149328292-3-795","Well done, penitent. Go now with speed.",""
"149328292-3-796","We should never have done this.",""
"149328292-3-797","If Shaman Chirah has his way, we'll be free.",""

"149328292-3-802","What? What is it?",""
"149328292-3-803","I'll get Tanion for this. He set me up!",""
"149328292-3-805","Secure the mine and kill these interlopers!",""
"149328292-3-806","Begone, outsiders.",""
"149328292-3-807","It's time to take action! I'm sick and tired of these Red Rook bandits!",""
"149328292-3-808","We were separated from the elders. I hope they are safe.",""
"149328292-3-810","It burns! My skin … it's on fire!",""
"149328292-3-811","Aldcroft must fall! For claw and fang!",""

"149328292-3-816","I'll dye the ground red with your blood!",""
"149328292-3-818","I heard that you and that adorable Tamien Sellan are responsible for saving Crosswych.",""
"149328292-3-819","Thank you, friend!",""
"149328292-3-820","I think it's time to pack up and move to Daggerfall. That should be safer than Crosswych, I imagine.",""
"149328292-3-821","Not much here, is there?",""
"149328292-3-822","We're keeping any on things here for now.",""
"149328292-3-823","Watch yer step, there's slime everywhere.",""
"149328292-3-824","We don't need any more refugees here. If you can't pay your way, move on.",""
"149328292-3-825","She's taking on water, captain! Crew to the pumps!",""
"149328292-3-826","Aldcroft isn't safe, friend. If you decide to go farther I can't guarantee you'll come back with all your parts still attached.",""
"149328292-3-827","Ah, my sleek friend.",""
"149328292-3-828","Heita-Meen is looking into these murders personally. You have my word.",""
"149328292-3-829","We've got the bastards on the run now!",""
"149328292-3-830","Quit slouching, you pitiful excuse for a soldier!",""
"149328292-3-831","The Worms are desperate. Honrich Tower is their last stand.",""
"149328292-3-832","That's Jorunn's hand-picked champion. Crushed the Worm Cult at Honrich Tower.",""
"149328292-3-833","The Reachmen overran Shor's Stone and Fallowstone! They're all over the Rift!",""
"149328292-3-834","People who go to Lost Prospect don't come back.",""
"149328292-3-835","I know you. You stopped the Worm Cult at Lost Prospect. Thank you.",""
"149328292-3-836","What's happening at Skald's Retreat? Is it really cursed?",""
"149328292-3-837","I heard about the nightmare at Skald's Retreat. I'm glad you dealt with it.",""
"149328292-3-838","You were the one who helped Vigrod retake Fallowstone Hall! Bless you!",""
"149328292-3-839","The Three fill the world, like the land, sea, and sky.",""
"149328292-3-840","Move it, move it, move it!",""
"149328292-3-841","Why are old ruins always so dangerous?",""
"149328292-3-842","You make it look so easy.",""
"149328292-3-843","I'll bet the draugr gave those Worms a fight when they broke into Taarengrav.",""
"149328292-3-844","There's the one who fought beside the Companions at Taarengrav! Crushed those cultists like the worms they are!",""
"149328292-3-845","Something stirred up the giants in the hills near Treva's Farm. I wonder what.",""
"149328292-3-846","They say a hero fought a giant chieftain in the hills near Treva's Farm. I wish I could've seen that!",""
"149328292-3-847","Challenges of strength and prowess. Trials of endurance and willpower. Even tests of the mind. The contests at Geirmund's Hall determine the greatest champions among the Nords.",""
"149328292-3-848","Thane Vigrun sure knows how to throw a party.",""
"149328292-3-849","Take a good long look. I'll be here all day.",""
"149328292-3-850","Not so tough in a fair fight, are you?",""
"149328292-3-851","Huh?",""
"149328292-3-852","What's that? I hear rumblings from their leaders. There are so many twists and turns in this humble narrative.",""
"149328292-3-854","By her command!",""
"149328292-3-855","Keep up the slaughter. The champions will arrive soon. The Altmer champion, in particular, has been here a very long time.",""
"149328292-3-856","Let's have some fun.",""
"149328292-3-857","Hear that? The champions are coming! Do you have strength enough remaining to kill three more of these disgusting humans?",""
"149328292-3-860","Now I do my part!",""
"149328292-3-861","Why can't I find my home? This is maddening. I've been looking for so long.",""
"149328292-3-862","Hungry. Need meat.",""
"149328292-3-863","This is a military camp, not fit for the likes of you. Be on your way, little one.",""
"149328292-3-864","My brother was sent off to battle against the Ebonheart Pact, and I am assigned to escort a diplomat to Stormhaven? This is not what I expected when I signed on to serve in King Fahara'jhad's army.",""
"149328292-3-865","I never really considered Sir Edmund as a leader, but now I think he might be the right man for the job.",""
"149328292-3-866","Thank you for releasing us!",""
"149328292-3-867","Where is everyone? There should be more people here.",""
"149328292-3-868","I don't think any of you are walking out of here alive.",""
"149328292-3-869","You're either brave, or stupid.",""
"149328292-3-870","More food for my little ones.",""
"149328292-3-871","I'll live a good life. I promise.",""
"149328292-3-873","Looks like we're adding more bones to these ruins.",""
"149328292-3-874","Nobody's going to save you here.",""
"149328292-3-875","Shalidor seems vexed. It's a pity Sheogorath denied the arch-mage the joy of translating these tomes himself.",""
"149328292-3-880","A hundred mewling kittens make less noise than you!",""
"149328292-3-881","Hurry, I'm slipping away!",""
"149328292-3-883","Thank you, friend!",""
"149328292-3-891","You will never again plague my people!",""

"149328292-3-895","Meddlesome wretch!",""
"149328292-3-896","That was a great tune.",""
"149328292-3-897","Get that door open! We must signal the fleet!",""
"149328292-3-899","I'm right you know! You'll see—when they plunder our town!",""
"149328292-3-900","This is bad. This is all bad. What's happening to us.",""
"149328292-3-901","The only Drublog I want to see are dead ones.",""
"149328292-3-902","May your eggs be abundant and your nest damp!",""
"149328292-3-903","Will do.",""
"149328292-3-904","Sharp Claws, let's see this done!",""
"149328292-3-905","The sea calls to this one. Feel the call of Jone and Jode.",""
"149328292-3-906","Bring me a proper lover's gift. Bring me the Dream Shard.",""
"149328292-3-909","Deposit the essences you have. Only then can you gain more.",""
"149328292-3-911","The lesser souls make my attraction spell useless against the greater soul. You'll need to deposit them first.",""
"149328292-3-922","Practice now, talk later! Take this seriously!",""
"149328292-3-923","I don't have time for pickpockets. Stay back!",""
"149328292-3-925","Let me try something else. That wasn't really to my taste.",""
"149328292-3-926","I really wouldn't talk about that. It's just inviting trouble.",""
"149328292-3-928","I'll hold the shield as long as I can!",""
"149328292-3-929","I can't believe you defeated us. What a sorry day for the Sentinels.",""
"149328292-3-930","We have to hold here until the relic is ours!",""
"149328292-3-931","They're worse than the Colovians were! Begone spirits!",""
"149328292-3-932","Darkness comes.",""
"149328292-3-937","Watch your back in the ruins, comrade. Dwarven constructs show no pity, remorse, or fear.nnThey cannot be stopped unless they are destroyed.",""
"149328292-3-938","This one has not been to a Dwarven ruin in some time. It is not a problem for Aelif. The steam ruins her fur. The noise hurts her ears. nnIt's better that you go, comrade.",""
"149328292-3-939","I hope this will be enough.",""
"149328292-3-944","I can never find sleep. And thus, never can you!",""
"149328292-3-945","20% chance I say this line!",""
"149328292-3-947","Hey, when's the next high tide?",""
"149328292-3-948","Talons are ever sharp!",""
"149328292-3-949","Eyes in the dark.",""
"149328292-3-950","Stay safe, citizen!",""
"149328292-3-951","Another day of just scraping by. nnI thought Wind Keep was going to be my opportunity to make some decent gold. So much for that idea.",""
"149328292-3-952","I think I might buy one of Raolin Munier's pigs. I've just been having this craving for bacon lately.",""
"149328292-3-953","Wood Elf is the new look this year.",""
"149328292-3-955","Just finished cleaning in here. No drawer left unturned.",""
"149328292-3-956","Yes, yes. We stuff the …nnOh! And then we put that into … Oh my yes. Sounds delicious!",""
"149328292-3-957","Intruders! End them. We don't have time for this.",""
"149328292-3-960","Do you think your friends will help you now?",""
"149328292-3-962","You certainly have a lot of ideas.",""
"149328292-3-965","Redguards, ha! I'm sick of the lot of you!",""
"149328292-3-966","For you.",""
"149328292-3-969","How long do we have to go through with this?",""
"149328292-3-970","This is the last batch of sugar. Kill them!",""
"149328292-3-971","Young men and women often come to the cathedral to soothe their aching hearts. Let them beware Dibella. The fire in her eyes has a way of attracting the lonely and the lover alike.",""
"149328292-3-975","This is not so high! I've been on ships with higher masts.",""
"149328292-3-977","Perhaps we've had our fill of excitement for now.",""
"149328292-3-979","My little brother ran off and joined the Supernal Dreamers. I'm disappointed, but I sure hope he isn't caught and brought here.",""
"149328292-3-980","I guess there aren't any Supernal Dreamers left to execute. I hear some hero-type wiped out every camp in Stormhaven.",""
"149328292-3-981","I thought Crosswych was done for until you showed up.",""
"149328292-3-984","I think we sent a message to the Red Rooks or anyone else who thinks they can cause trouble in Crosswych.",""
"149328292-3-985","That's not your brew, friend.",""
"149328292-3-988","Stormhaven is doomed! Mark my words! The Covenant will be our downfall!",""
"149328292-3-990","Designs are coming to me faster than I can write them all down!",""
"149328292-3-994","I will take your shell, mortal!",""
"149328292-3-995","You Altmer sure can't handle your drink.",""
"149328292-3-997","… and they burned! The fire was so hot, I couldn't save them!",""
"149328292-3-998","An ugly lot, these cultists.",""
"149328292-3-999","The general's orders are to be ready to move out. And no, I don't know where.",""
"149328292-3-1000","You fought well.",""
"149328292-3-1001","What are you looking at?",""
"149328292-3-1002","Good show!",""
"149328292-3-1003","What is it?",""
"149328292-3-1006","Aetherius calls for you.",""
"149328292-3-1007","No entry.",""
"149328292-3-1012","It's finally gone! I need a minute to catch my breath and then I'll meet you at the ritual site.",""
"149328292-3-1013","I've had a few too many, already.",""
"149328292-3-1016","Why so much fear? She's just a woman … who may break my heart and ruin my life.",""
"149328292-3-1019","Thank you so much! Thank you! Thank you!",""
"149328292-3-1029","Get away from me. The others attack if they think we're planning something.",""
"149328292-3-1030","This one must beg your aid.",""
"149328292-3-1034","Nobody disturbs the masters!",""
"149328292-3-1035","Don't let them reach Lord Winterbourne!",""
"149328292-3-1043","Some of you may wonder what I've learned since meeting the elder Spinners of Silvenar, and you need not worry. My research has shown their ""prophecies"" to be nothing more than conjecture and finely spun lies!",""
"149328292-3-1044","You remind me of someone I met once. I was on a pirate ship. Tied to the mast. Long story.",""
"149328292-3-1045","Keep your blade ready.",""
"149328292-3-1046","My blade's getting dull. One of the worst things about being Queen.",""
"149328292-3-1052","This can't go on. The Red Rooks can't take over Crosswych. It's just not right!",""
"149328292-3-1053","I prefer to be able to walk the streets without getting harassed by despicable thugs.",""
"149328292-3-1055","You stepped onto the wrong beach.",""
"149328292-3-1061","Drag these intruders back to the ship.",""
"149328292-3-1062","Mathiisen steel is the best in Auridon. Perhaps the best in the south. Well worth the trip, most days.",""
"149328292-3-1063","This one is trying to think of what she will do with all the coin she earns from Mathiisen. Moons bless the one who freed the city from that scum!",""
"149328292-3-1064","Why would the Divines allow something like this to happen to my village? To Shattered Grove?",""
"149328292-3-1065","Mara, your love is like a spring. Your waters have cleansed Shattered Grove.",""
"149328292-3-1066","The Skywatch Defiance Festival! The greatest party of the year!",""
"149328292-3-1067","The Defiance festival goes on, but Kinlady Estre stripped of her noble rank!",""
"149328292-3-1068","That one came down from Phaer. Sounds like a plague has hit the town pretty bad.",""
"149328292-3-1072","I like Daggerfall. Always something going on in a city of this size.",""
"149328292-3-1073","Looking for information about Daggerfall? nnAsk someone else.",""
"149328292-3-1076","I can feel you.",""
"149328292-3-1077","If there's hope for my ma, there's hope for you! Keep it up!",""
"149328292-3-1079","Keep your weapons sheathed and we won't need to have words.",""
"149328292-3-1080","I live to nourish another day.",""
"149328292-3-1085","I'm not done, just catching my breath. Go on!",""
"149328292-3-1086","It has been some time since my claws were last tested. Will this be the next?",""
"149328292-3-1087","I hate spriggans. Trees with eyes. And they make such strange noises.",""
"149328292-3-1088","Strike us, and we turn with the blow. Immerse us, and we do not drown. Surround us, and we swim free.nnSo we live. So we have always lived.",""
"149328292-3-1089","I think we can deal with a few trolls. Who's with me? Anyone? No? All right then, never mind.",""
"149328292-3-1090","Your claws are the sharper. May they see only peace.",""
"149328292-3-1091","Let's hurry!",""
"149328292-3-1092","Don't make me come in!",""
"149328292-3-1093","You really don't want to mess with me!",""
"149328292-3-1094","Don't bet in the arena. The games are fixed. I learned it the hard way.",""
"149328292-3-1095","The skies part and light shines through!",""
"149328292-3-1096","Maybe I could take a short nap, somewhere Shagrod won't find me.",""
"149328292-3-1097","These robes have been passed down from the kings of old. Try not to get blood on them.",""
"149328292-3-1098","We won, didn't we? Tell me we won.",""
"149328292-3-1099","If you don't need healing, don't waste my time now.",""
"149328292-3-1101","We welcome our Bosmer and Khajiiti allies into the Thalmor!",""

"149328292-3-1112","What's that? You're choking? Too bad, you little baby! Finish that pie!",""
"149328292-3-1120","I'll never swear allegiance to your kind.",""

"149328292-3-1127","A mission accomplished and the Dominion cause advanced! Excellent, but there is always more to be done.",""
"149328292-3-1129","It is a long path we walk. Your mission has taken us one step farther.",""
"149328292-3-1132","The more you achieve for the Pact, the more we ask of you. It is an honor to serve with you!",""
"149328292-3-1134","Grand Warlord Zimmeron will hear of your success, warrior!",""
"149328292-3-1136","Yes, you've done well. When you're done congratulating yourself, there's plenty more to be done.",""
"149328292-3-1137","I would be proud to bare steel alongside you, warrior. Continue your efforts for the Covenant!",""
"149328292-3-1138","I don't think I can take much more of this. I can't sleep. I can't think. And the food tastes terrible.",""
"149328292-3-1139","I'm so tired. But I can't go to sleep. I heard if you fall asleep in Coldharbour, you never wake up.",""
"149328292-3-1140","I felt good about that. Didn't you? Let's keep moving.",""
"149328292-3-1141","Now, I know some of you are wondering why I ban Necromancy in my classroom. Trust me. The smell alone is worth steering clear.",""
"149328292-3-1146","Not the kagouti! Not again!",""

"149328292-3-3113","You are free to go, as soon as you pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3116","You're caught, so it's time to behave yourself. Let's keep this civil.",""
"149328292-3-3119","One day I'll meet an outlaw who pays a bounty without complaint. Will this be the day?",""
"149328292-3-3122","Bah! All criminals are craven cowards and you're no different! Will you pay in gold or blood?",""
"149328292-3-3125","Oh, Dumac take you! I can't tell you how this grates on my patience. Pay your bounty and begone!",""
"149328292-3-3128","Stop in the name of the law! What? We have to say that. It's in the regulations.",""
"149328292-3-3131","The bounty is an opportunity for you to set yourself right with me and with the gods.",""
"149328292-3-3134","Look, I'm only asking because my captain will kill me if I don't. Can I collect your bounty please?",""
"149328292-3-3137","I think we should execute criminals on sight, but my captain won't allow it.  He wants your bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3140","You need to clear your record and I need to pay my rent, so turn over your bounty, if you please.",""
"149328292-3-3143","The criminal's dilemma is easily resolved. Pay the bounty and live to defy the law another day.",""
"149328292-3-3146","Guilty? Innocent? This one couldn't care less. I'm just here to collect your bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3149","I am the law in this place and you will pay the bounty for your crimes.",""
"149328292-3-3152","Evil deeds always come back to haunt you. This bounty is the least of your worries.",""
"149328292-3-3155","Lucky for you, this one likes to toy with her prey. After I collect your bounty, of course.",""
"149328292-3-3158","You think you're clever, hm? Not clever enough to avoid getting caught. Looks like you owe a bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3161","You were caught with your hand in the moon-sugar jar again, weren't you?",""
"149328292-3-3164","This one detests being a hagraven, but you do have a bounty hanging over your head. Will you pay?",""
"149328292-3-3167","This one smells fear. Oh, wait. That is me. Well, at least one of us has the proper attitude.",""
"149328292-3-3170","This one will stand very close and breathe on you until you pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3173","Dark moons and dull claws! This one is so tired of confronting criminals! Pay your gold and go away.",""
"149328292-3-3176","A bounty has been placed on your person in accordance with local law. This one is here to demand payment.",""
"149328292-3-3179","This one loves justice. And gold. Lucky me, I will claim both!",""
"149328292-3-3182","You have two options: pay the bounty or face a beating. This one knows which he would choose.",""
"149328292-3-3185","I'm not responsible for accidents that happen to those who won't pay their bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3188","Stop and pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3191","Some guards might try to squeeze extra gold out of you, but all I ask is that you pay what you owe.",""
"149328292-3-3194","I like you, thief. Give me your gold and you'll be free and clear.",""
"149328292-3-3197","Didn't your mother teach you right from wrong?",""
"149328292-3-3200","Come, wrongdoer, pay up and be quick about it.",""
"149328292-3-3203","Your compensation, now!",""
"149328292-3-3206","Crime never pays, sweetheart. That's why I got into law enforcement. Now, let's talk bounties, shall we?",""
"149328292-3-3209","Hi! I'm here for your bounty. Come on, pay up! You certainly look like you can afford it.",""
"149328292-3-3212","There is no clemency for criminals here. You must pay your bounty, or I will use force.",""
"149328292-3-3215","If you don't pay your bounty, I'll make you sing drinking songs with me.",""
"149328292-3-3218","My patience wears thin and my pockets are empty. Will you pay your bounty now?",""
"149328292-3-3221","It's nothing to be proud of, but it isn't the end of the world, either. Just pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3224","All right, lawbreaker, time to pay for your crimes. You are going to pay, right?",""
"149328292-3-3227","Don't give me a reason to hurt you. Just pay your bounty and be on your way.",""
"149328292-3-3230","The bad news is that you have to pay a fine. The good news is I'm going to get a promotion!",""
"149328292-3-3233","I'd pay the bounty for you if I could, but such favors are frowned upon by my superiors.",""
"149328292-3-3236","There's a reason I approached you ... Oh! I remember. You're a bad person. You need to pay a fine!",""
"149328292-3-3239","Look. If the captain weren't riding my arse, I wouldn't care, but I have to ask for your bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3242","You know what? You're such a good sort that I think I'll pay your bounty for you. That was a joke.",""
"149328292-3-3245","Fun time's over, you goblin-kissing bastard! Pay the bounty or this law-dog is going to chew you up!",""
"149328292-3-3248","Thought you were gonna get away, eh? You're dumber than I am!",""
"149328292-3-3251","Trust me, I enjoy this even less than you do. Pay the fine.",""
"149328292-3-3254","Great! Another criminal who hasn't paid the bounty! This is your chance to settle up, troll-breath!",""
"149328292-3-3257","The sword of justice cuts clean and true. Pay your bounty or bleed, criminal.",""
"149328292-3-3260","Watch yourself. I'm faster after a couple drinks. If you're smart, you'll just pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3263","You're too beautiful to be a criminal. I could help you make amends, if you're interested in such things.",""
"149328292-3-3266","Pay your bounty or die. There are no other options open to you.",""
"149328292-3-3269","Another day, another low-life. Just pay up. I've got better things to do than waste time with you.",""
"149328292-3-3272","Pay up, scum.  Don't worry--I guarantee that at least some will make it to your victims.",""
"149328292-3-3275","You were naughty. Now you owe a bounty. Says so right here.",""
"149328292-3-3278","It doesn't matter if you run. I'm not alone ... we'll all chase you down.",""
"149328292-3-3281","Every guard in the region wants to meet you, and I'm the lucky one to catch you first! Now, about your bounty ....",""
"149328292-3-3284","Oh boo hoo! Tell me another sob story, you spineless goat! I want your bounty and I want it yesterday!",""
"149328292-3-3287","Tell your excuses to someone who cares. I only want your bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3290","You face the same predicament as every other criminal. But it all goes away if you pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3293","They will sing of your crimes and the spectacular way you died, provided you do not pay me.",""
"149328292-3-3296","Pay or die, criminal. You have no other options.",""
"149328292-3-3299","There's no need for us to be enemies. I'm sure you had your reasons. But I must collect the bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3302","Don't think of running. It's time to pay.",""
"149328292-3-3305","Stay calm, my friend. I only ask that you pay your bounty and you can be on your way.",""
"149328292-3-3308","I'm just going to keep taunting you until you pay your fine.",""
"149328292-3-3311","Pay the fine or I'll have your skin for a cloak.",""
"149328292-3-3314","I'm sorry, but what you did was against the law, and now I need to collect a bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3317","Your crime spree is through. I'll have your bounty now.",""
"149328292-3-3320","You are found in violation of the criminal statutes of this fair land. You must pay a bounty.",""
"149328292-3-3323","Deep down you're a good person--I can tell. Here's your chance to prove it.",""
"149328292-3-3326","Blood and blades! I am so tired of confronting criminals! Pay your gold and go away.",""
"149328292-3-3329","Rejoice, criminal, for I have come to clear your name! Make recompense for your bounty, please.",""
"149328292-3-3332","There are always options. Pay your bounty or face a beating. Which will you choose?",""
"149328292-3-3343","I have to believe that more of our brothers and sisters found refuge out there. If only we could make contact! We may have the numbers to turn the tide.",""
"149328292-3-3358","Failure will not be accepted!",""
"149328292-3-3359","The mortals must not be allowed to disturb the connection!",""
"149328292-3-3360","Mortals must not breach the realm. Failure will be punished.",""
"149328292-3-3361","Make them believe that they have won, and they will never attack.",""
"149328292-3-3362","Any kyn who allows a breach will be destroyed … permanently.",""
"149328292-3-3363","Soon the Grand Gateway will be permanent, and the city will be Molag Bal's new capitol.",""
"149328292-3-3364","May a thousand thousand more of these animals fall to my blades.",""
"149328292-3-3365","We are to burn the Elven Gardens. Have we enough Atronachs?",""
"149328292-3-3366","By sword and flame, we will cleanse this sewer.",""
"149328292-3-3367","I pity the Dremora. They cannot comprehend the majesty of the Xivkyn.",""
"149328292-3-3368","It is often difficult to discern which mortals serve us and which we destroy.",""
"149328292-3-3369","The simple depravity of the daedrat is admirable, in its own way.",""
"149328292-3-3370","Scamps! I need more scamps!",""

"149328292-4-3275","Bounty? Don't know anything about that. They told me to collect restitution for your crimes. Shiny gold restitution.",""

"149328292-4-3281","A mistake, a misunderstanding, a lapse in judgment ... yes, yes. Now make it all go away and pay your fine.",""

"149328292-5-2915","Gracious--we've been busy haven't we? Well, I'm afraid the party is over. Pay up or else.",""
"149328292-5-2918","Scoundrel! You shall answer to the fullest extent of the law!",""
"149328292-5-2921","Pay your fine and perhaps we can do something about the deplorable state of your existence.",""

"149328292-5-2939","The more I am paid, the less I remember. You do want me to forget this, don't you?",""
"149328292-5-2942","When I first saw you, I thought ... where do I know you from? Then I remembered--you are a criminal.",""
"149328292-5-2945","I am sure nobody will think less of you once you pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-2948","Halt, you low-born cur. There is a bounty on your head and I will see it paid in full.",""
"149328292-5-2951","I love collecting bounties. I always wanted to be a poorly dressed, underpaid tax-collector.",""
"149328292-5-2954","Pay your bounty and no one will get hurt. Except me. Trouble at home, you know?",""
"149328292-5-2957","Let me help you clear your soul. Hand over your bounty and I'll put in a good word next time I pray.",""
"149328292-5-2960","The people call for justice ... and restitution. Pay your bounty and you may escape my wrath.",""
"149328292-5-2963","You're a very bad person, and I'm ... I'm going to take your bounty, all right?",""
"149328292-5-2966","I'm here to collect--your bounty or your head. You strike me as the 'bounty' type. More's the pity.",""
"149328292-5-2969","I was on a break, having a few drinks, when I noticed your criminal face.",""
"149328292-5-2972","Now I remember ... you're guilty! I suppose I need to demand your payment now.",""
"149328292-5-2975","My last prisoner? Stabbed himself in the back, after roughing himself up a bit. Hint, hint.",""
"149328292-5-2978","I must insist you pay your bounty. Justice shall be served.",""
"149328292-5-2981","Do not be deceived by my scholarly manner. I am quite capable of dealing with delinquent criminals.",""
"149328292-5-2984","We could've been good friends, if you hadn't been such a bad person.",""
"149328292-5-2987","Neither of us wants to be here, but here we are. So, can I collect your bounty now?",""
"149328292-5-2990","Why did you do such a bad thing?",""
"149328292-5-2993","I dare you to run. No, please. I'd like that.",""
"149328292-5-2996","You are a shining fish caught in a foul current, but you can still return to the river's flow.",""
"149328292-5-2999","We don't want any more trouble. Just pay your bounty and move on.",""
"149328292-5-3002","A little theft here and there, fine. But you just crossed the line.",""
"149328292-5-3005","The law wants justice. Me? I want to open you up and root around in your innards. Or you can pay.",""
"149328292-5-3008","As much as I respect everything you've done, I must ask you to pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3011","You really thought you would escape? Huh. I suppose we can't all be sensible.",""
"149328292-5-3014","In a sense, we're all prisoners of fate. Your fate is to pay a fine.",""
"149328292-5-3017","Surrender, culprit, or suffer my wrath! That was a bit much, wasn't it? I should have just asked for your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3020","That's it. Pay up.",""
"149328292-5-3023","Um, could I bother you to pay your bounty? That would be so much better than the alternative.",""
"149328292-5-3026","I don't want any trouble from you. Just pay the bounty and be on your way.",""
"149328292-5-3029","Excuse me. I think you owe a bounty. For crimes committed in the recent past. Allegedly. I think.",""
"149328292-5-3032","The gods will judge you eventually, but today you must contend with the law.",""
"149328292-5-3035","Just pay the fine and get lost, all right? I'm off in an hour and I've had a long day.",""
"149328292-5-3038","Just as I expected. Another foolish criminal who needs to be punished. Now pay your fine, you cad!",""
"149328292-5-3041","I guess I have to make you pay a fine now.",""
"149328292-5-3044","Why not gamble? You'll have a better chance of success than a life of crime.",""
"149328292-5-3047","There's no point in trying to escape. There are more guards after you than there are trees in the forest.",""
"149328292-5-3050","I can make all your legal troubles go away. For the usual bounty, of course.",""
"149328292-5-3053","What an exhilarating chase! Now give me your bounty and maybe I'll let you catch me.",""
"149328292-5-3056","I'm not here to lecture or moralize about what you did. I'm just here to collect the bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3059","Your transgressions have caught up with you. The wise course would be to pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3062","Look, I'm not a brave guard. I just want to do my job and get out of here. I hope you understand.",""
"149328292-5-3065","My helm's off to you! It's rare that I catch such a talented criminal. A pity you must pay the fine.",""
"149328292-5-3068","We will not deviate from the prescribed method of recompense. Criminal bounties must be paid in gold.",""
"149328292-5-3071","I hate people. When you commit a crime, I have to deal with people. See where this is going? Pay up.",""
"149328292-5-3074","There is nowhere you can run that I will not follow, rogue! Pay your bounty!",""
"149328292-5-3077","Um. You're a criminal, so I guess that means I have to stop you. Please just be nice about this.",""
"149328292-5-3080","You're a good person. I can tell. Now prove it and pay your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3083","Looks like you've got a bounty to pay off. But you can't put a price on a clean slate, am I right?",""
"149328292-5-3086","There's no talking yourself out of this one. You committed a crime and got caught.",""
"149328292-5-3089","We know what you've done. Pay your bounty and we'll leave you be.",""
"149328292-5-3092","I'd let you off, but I still need to pay my tab. You need to hand over your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3095","Dragging your feet isn't going to make this any easier, f'lah. I've got all the time in the world.",""
"149328292-5-3098","Everybody wants to pay me a bounty. It must be my face. It has that 'you can trust me' quality.",""
"149328292-5-3101","What audacity! What utter gall! I'll have no more of it. Just pay your fine and be gone!",""
"149328292-5-3104","I've seen cliff-racers that are scarier than you. Pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3107","The criminals around here used to have class. Now it's all dirt and bloodstains.",""
"149328292-5-3110","Can we be quick about this? I have another engagement and I hate to keep her waiting.",""
"149328292-5-3113","You owe a bounty and I'm here to collect.",""
"149328292-5-3116","It saddens me how many people commit crimes. I hope you're ready to make amends.",""
"149328292-5-3119","Wait, you're not who I .... No matter, turns out there's a bounty on your head as well. Pay up, then.",""
"149328292-5-3122","There's a bounty on your head and I'll see it paid in full. Might even bring a smile to my face.",""
"149328292-5-3125","Another fetcher? How many of you are there? Let's get it over with. Hand over your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3128","It's been a long day, so let's keep this short. Will you pay your bounty now?",""
"149328292-5-3131","Freedom can be bought, but forgiveness must be earned, criminal.",""
"149328292-5-3134","I can tell you're used to getting what you want. So ... do you want to give me your bounty?",""
"149328292-5-3137","It's a travesty that criminals walk free instead of being kept as slaves. Ah, the old days. Now, your bounty?",""
"149328292-5-3140","My orders are to collect your bounty. What happens after I take your gold is none of your concern.",""
"149328292-5-3143","I don't hold your malformed sense of morality against you, but I'm afraid you must pay a fine.",""
"149328292-5-3146","Come, fragrant one. You know you'd much rather deal with me than with one of the other guards.",""
"149328292-5-3149","Desist at once from your criminal acts! Pay the bounty or face the decisive claws of justice.",""
"149328292-5-3152","Justice is impersonal. You committed a crime. Now you must pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3155","This one would like to get to know you better. A lot better. But first, your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3158","I can clear your name, but it will cost you.",""
"149328292-5-3161","Try to run, clawless one. I dare you!",""
"149328292-5-3164","Good citizen, this one insists that you surrender and make restitution for your crimes.",""
"149328292-5-3167","Payment would be an acceptable alternative to fighting, yes?",""
"149328292-5-3170","This one loves it when they refuse to pay the bounty. I keep my claws sharp for just such occasions!",""
"149328292-5-3173","The moons have gifted this one with sharp eyes and fast feet, yes? You are caught, you dungy fool.",""
"149328292-5-3176","By the dictate of the guard-commander, I have come to claim your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3179","It is better to claim bounties than pay them, yes? This one would know.",""
"149328292-5-3182","The law is not without mercy. Pay the bounty and you're free to go. Simple, yes?",""
"149328292-5-3185","Pay your bounty, corrupt one. Or refuse, if you prefer, so I can gut you like a fish.",""
"149328292-5-3188","No sudden moves. Pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3191","You don't have to confess anything. You just have to pay the gold and your name is cleared.",""
"149328292-5-3194","We have a common purpose, friend. You want the law to leave you alone and I want your gold.",""
"149328292-5-3197","What's that? Too stupid to know the law? I don't doubt it. But you still have to pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3200","There's no reason for this to get ugly, milk-drinker.",""
"149328292-5-3203","Pay your bounty, villain!",""
"149328292-5-3206","Looks like you've been naughty--and not in the good way. Now it'll cost you.",""
"149328292-5-3209","You have a criminal record. I can help with that! I'll gladly accept payment to make this go away.",""
"149328292-5-3212","The suggested action is that you pay the fee for your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3215","I may be ineb … intox … I may be drunk, but I am no criminal. I don't think. Now pay up!",""
"149328292-5-3218","What happens next is up to you. If you pay your fine, this all goes away. I prefer the other option.",""
"149328292-5-3221","This doesn't have to be difficult. Pay the bounty and I'm on my way.",""
"149328292-5-3224","Look, I know you have better things to do, but can you just pay your bounty?  Please?",""
"149328292-5-3227","You need to pay your bounty. There really isn't any other option.",""
"149328292-5-3230","Don't look so glum. Justice is great if you give it a chance! Pay and you'll feel better, trust me!",""
"149328292-5-3233","I love rabbit meatballs! Do you love rabbit meatballs? Pay your fine and we may one day eat together.",""
"149328292-5-3236","Stop criminal. If you try to run ... something bad will probably happen. Uh, can't remember.",""
"149328292-5-3239","Well what do we have here? Looks like a fugitive from the law. Come on now. Cough up that bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3242","Greetings! I'll be your bounty collector today. I accept gold, and gold, and, well, gold! Pay up!",""
"149328292-5-3245","You're caught! Pay the fine or I start throwing punches!",""
"149328292-5-3248","Hold it, you law-breaking bastard! You've got a bounty that needs paying. With gold I mean.",""
"149328292-5-3251","It could be worse, I guess. Still, you're in a lot of trouble.",""
"149328292-5-3254","Halt and don't move! I mean, you can move a little. To pay your bounty, I guess.",""
"149328292-5-3257","Do I look like I care about innocence or guilt? All I care about is receiving your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3260","I told him ... I have a job to do! And it's the truth. See? Here I am, doing it. Give me your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3263","A blade cuts whatever it touches. Just like you. I guess I should keep my distance.",""
"149328292-5-3266","Time heals nothing, cheaters never prosper, and crime doesn't pay. It's obvious, really.",""
"149328292-5-3269","Why put people in jail when you can just bleed them for gold, right? What a racket.",""
"149328292-5-3272","Want some advice? If you don't want to get caught, become a guard. Speaking of getting caught ....",""
"149328292-5-3275","You know what happens to criminals? They pay their bounties or they die. Really! That's what happens.",""
"149328292-5-3278","You made me run, in this armor? Next time, I'll pick you off at range.",""
"149328292-5-3281","We have our roles to play--you, the criminal, and I, the hero. Well, the hero who collects your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3284","I'm going to count to three and then I want your bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3287","Pay your bounty or I will hurt you.",""
"149328292-5-3290","I realize that your kind can't help itself. So if you pay your fine I'll let you walk away.",""
"149328292-5-3293","You've seen all the scum missing their left hands? That was me. So pay your bounty, or I'll start calling you Lefty.",""
"149328292-5-3296","Rejoice, infidel dog! I am here to collect your bounty and clear your name.",""
"149328292-5-3299","We all have our bad days. I understand. Nevertheless, the law is the law.",""
"149328292-5-3302","You break the law, you pay the fine. Simple.",""
"149328292-5-3305","The seeds of crime grow bitter fruit. Let me help you make restitution.",""
"149328292-5-3308","Let us play a game! I can portray the guard and you the criminal. Now, shall I beat you until you pay your fine?",""
"149328292-5-3311","Your first mistake was committing a crime on my watch. You don't get a second.",""
"149328292-5-3314","When you consider it, the bounty is a reasonable price to pay for your crimes.",""
"149328292-5-3317","You owe us a debt. We will have it in gold or blood. Choose.",""
"149328292-5-3320","You have been caught in commission of illegal acts. Pay the bounty.",""
"149328292-5-3323","Crime is beneath you, friend. Pay the bounty so you can get back to proper heroics!",""
"149328292-5-3326","By my father's head, another infidel dog stands before me? Will this one pay its bounty?",""
"149328292-5-3329","Know, O criminal, that your transgressions have been recorded. A simple payment will clear your name.",""
"149328292-5-3332","I will gladly accept your bounty. You do plan on paying your bounty, correct?",""
"149328292-5-6397","Someone was here just yesterday looking for this. My client will be very pleased to know you found it.nnSorry, all I've got to pay you with is gold.",""
"149328292-5-6398","I've been looking for this forever. You have no idea how much I appreciate the effort you took to return this to me. So kind.nnLet me give you this in exchange. Let's call it a little reward.",""
"149328292-5-6468","Friend! How long has it been? No, no, just put that Enforcer garbage out of your head and let me remind you about the opportunity waiting for you here.",""
"149328292-5-6469","Trust me. I've been on both sides of the law myself. It's no life, being hunted all the time, stealing for your meals. Much better to be an Enforcer—let others do the stealing for you!",""
