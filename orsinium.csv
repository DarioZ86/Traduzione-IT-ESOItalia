"149328292-0-6977","<screams as they are picked up by a harpy and flown away>",""
"149328292-0-6978","If you see a bat, and it's holding a baby, that's … my … baby!",""
"149328292-0-6979","Hold it. We've got company.",""
"149328292-0-6980","I'm happy to help these poor monks. I can always use a few more blessings.",""
"149328292-0-6981","Locked! Okay, I'll just be a moment!",""
"149328292-0-6982","I summon your death!",""
"149328292-0-6983","Anything you'd care to … stow in our vaults?",""
"149328292-0-6986","I watch the horses more closely than my children.",""
"149328292-0-6987","I have all the style materials you need under one roof!",""
"149328292-0-6989","I usually ply my trade for half-wits, but not today. I can tell you're a connoisseur.",""
"149328292-0-6990","No thievery in my shop. If you aren't here for supplies, you must go.",""
"149328292-0-6991","I have art to make. What do you want?",""
"149328292-0-6992","If you're in Abah's, you're either desperate or stupid. So? Which is it?",""
"149328292-0-6994","My records are meticulous. I know exactly what is stolen each week!",""
"149328292-0-6995","I can handle my rotmeth. After a nap, it will all balance out.",""
"149328292-0-6996","You looking for magical trinkets? Staves, gems, enchanted jewelry?",""
"149328292-0-6997","The interior designs of my leathers are … quite prurient. Absolutely no returns.",""
"149328292-0-6998","Huh.",""
"149328292-0-6999","Who … who sent you? No, no. Don't tell me.",""
"149328292-0-7000","Let's go find some treasure!",""
"149328292-0-7001","There's a huge selection of drinks here. Still can't pass up anything other than a good red wine though.",""
"149328292-0-7002","Turap'su prays that these monks can shake off the Bent Dance. If they don't … this one must do what is necessary.",""
"149328292-0-7003","Teifi travels with the Twilight Cantors. Most of the time, it is a joy. But not this time.",""
"149328292-0-7004","What can I get you? If you want. You aren't required to buy anything.",""
"149328292-0-7005","No discount for bringing your own hammock.",""
"149328292-0-7006","The warehouse is filled with smoke!",""
"149328292-0-7007","Nope!",""
"149328292-0-7008","Ah! Don't hit me!",""
"149328292-1-6878","Nothing happened. If you must guess, at least try to guess correctly.",""
"149328292-1-6879","The mammoth are sparse here. Have you noticed? Their population dwindles.",""
"149328292-1-6880","The soldiers will send me back to the wild if they spot me. Do me a favor and keep your mouth shut.",""
"149328292-1-6881","Slay the mortals! Leave none alive!",""
"149328292-1-6883","I might try a helping.",""
"149328292-1-6884","I used to think she was a roadside cook … not an artist with an oven.",""
"149328292-1-6885","Look, little beasts! More toys!",""
"149328292-1-6886","Be praised! More blood for the feast!",""
"149328292-1-6890","Molag Bal will be pleased that we continue his work!",""
"149328292-1-6891","This quarry will make a fine hunt!",""

"149328292-1-6897","Behold my lovely roiling cloud! I shall await you there.",""
"149328292-1-6898","I will scorch you to ash!",""
"149328292-1-6899","Now for the final phase. Watch as I absorb all the power I need!",""
"149328292-1-6900","Blood and meat, that's all you are to me.",""
"149328292-1-6902","Worm! I'll swallow you whole!",""
"149328292-1-6903","You are just a pest to be swatted away!",""
"149328292-1-6904","Got you now, weakling!",""
"149328292-1-6905","Enough! You try my patience. Take this!",""
"149328292-1-6907","You shall fry in your own skin!",""
"149328292-1-6908","Pain! Pain! PAIN!",""
"149328292-1-6909","Burn! Burn! Burn!",""
"149328292-1-6910","You'll die—like all the others.",""
"149328292-1-6911","Now you shall taste the lightning!",""
"149328292-1-6912","Think you can take me? You're wrong!",""
"149328292-1-6913","The light will not save you!",""
"149328292-1-6914","You are not worthy to gaze upon her!",""
"149328292-1-6916","I challenge you!",""
"149328292-1-6917","Time to prove what they say of you!",""
"149328292-1-6920","You don't have the guts!",""
"149328292-1-6922","This will sizzle your spine!",""
"149328292-1-6923","Ha ha ha! Bring me another!",""
"149328292-1-6924","Mortals! So predictable!",""
"149328292-1-6925","The ritual, interrupted, is nearly complete. You will be my final test.",""
"149328292-1-6926","The ritual is complete! Know my true wrath!",""
"149328292-1-6927","Supplies are now reaching the city on a regular basis. Maybe now our basic city functions will get repaired.",""
"149328292-1-6931","Are we lost? It feels like we're lost. I'll … you know, I'll just follow you.",""
"149328292-1-6932","Pathetic.",""
"149328292-1-6933","This one does not mind the cold. It keeps the goods fresh, yes?",""
"149328292-1-6935","Be careful out there, friend. Just look what the mountain did to me! Actually don't look. It's, uh … it's far too gruesome!",""
"149328292-1-6937","I've followed the researchers for months. They feed me and let me sleep in the equipment tent.nnI should probably ask for a job, but I don't want to ruin a good thing.",""
"149328292-1-6938","Dig in. It's all fresh.",""
"149328292-1-6939","All the cups are freshly scrubbed. Just like all records of Varen Aquilarios.",""
"149328292-1-6940","This one sells no skooma. It is a vicious rumor! Everyone knows to go to <<1>>'s cousin for that.",""
"149328292-1-6941","Shouldn't have stocked that much armor. Busted the wagon on my way in. Care to lighten the load?",""
"149328292-1-6943","Do you feel the more gold you come across, the more problems you see? This one does not! Let us deal.",""
"149328292-1-6944","Paupers beware! No haggling!",""
"149328292-1-6945","A lament: The Mane has not been by this sale season. As many shames as moons.",""
"149328292-1-6946","A lament: Never have I once successfully sold an item to King Emeric. Said he, ""One crown is enough.""",""
"149328292-1-6948","This one knows, in Summurset, often gold is set aside in favour of crystals or artworks. Not so here! She only loves gold.",""
"149328292-1-6949","Jades, precious stones, Hist-amber, all of these things from Blackmarsh have no appeal for this one. Gold! She hungers for gold.",""
"149328292-1-6953","This one does not accept barter of favors or threats. Gold, only.",""
"149328292-1-6954","This one does not accept barter of moon sugar or skooma. Gold, only.",""
"149328292-1-6955","There is a phrase we have heard before — ""Skyrim for the Nords"". What of Skyrim's riches? Can they be for others?",""
"149328292-1-6956","This one does not accept barter of arms or armor. Gold, only.",""
"149328292-1-6958","A good day. A good day to spend all of your money! Or just much of it.",""
"149328292-1-6959","A fine night, to drink, or dance, or spend a tidy sum on only the very finest of things.",""
"149328292-1-6960","Do you dream of being pursued by hunters, longing for your hide? Dream instead of riches!",""
"149328292-1-6961","Let us deal, yes? But we leave the bats and such things at home.",""
"149328292-1-6963","The Madgod would encourage you to spend on trifles such as an acreage of cheese or shoes made of live cats. He and we are nothing alike. Spend here!",""
"149328292-1-6964","We know, gold is meaningless when one could die tomorrow in another, stranger, dungeon rife with peril. Spend your money here instead!",""
"149328292-1-6966","Though this one hungers for gold, she does worry after the needs of the individual. Take care of yourself.",""
"149328292-1-6967","In all of your time adventuring, what is the size of your hoard? Unburden and unpack! Give me your money!",""
"149328292-1-6968","One suspects, if you are so affluent as to afford these goods, you may have had a somewhat dodgy inheritance.",""
"149328292-1-6972","Your shipment makes standing here all day worthwhile.",""
"149328292-1-6975","The cod are running thick this year. They're a little scrawny, but I make it up in volume.",""
"149328292-1-6977","<screams as they are picked up by a harpy and flown away, second version>",""
"149328292-1-6978","I'm sorry I was late, but a bat … made off … with the baby. How do you tell someone that? Hoo, I could go for some skooma!",""
"149328292-1-6979","Quiet. Someone's close.",""
"149328292-1-6980","I wish I had some autumn-honey tea to sell. These Twilight Cantors are going to sing themselves hoarse.",""
"149328292-1-6981","Got this one, too! See you inside!",""
"149328292-1-6982","After I kill you, I shall animate your corpse!",""
"149328292-1-6984","Our vault is secure. Despite the rumors.",""
"149328292-1-6985","No complaints about the prices. I won't haggle.",""
"149328292-1-6986","I'd never eat from a feed bag, but it seems so … efficient.",""
"149328292-1-6987","You should avoid <<1>>, the blacksmith. He is a known cheat.",""
"149328292-1-6989","My condition is expensive to maintain. It's why I charge a premium to the idiots.",""
"149328292-1-6990","I won't tolerate thieves. Show me your coin, or show me your back.",""
"149328292-1-6991","No, I don't follow the Green Pact. And it's none of your bloody business why.",""
"149328292-1-6994","I don't forget my best customers. Nor do I forgive their debt.",""
"149328292-1-6995","Last night I thought the sky had four moons. A few mugs later, it was back to two.",""
"149328292-1-6996","I can supply you with magical supplies. If you're in the market. And discreet.",""
"149328292-1-6997","You should never forgo undergarments when wearing my leathers. All sales are final.",""
"149328292-1-6998","Hm.",""
"149328292-1-6999","Just say what you need and go. I can't be seen talking to you.",""
"149328292-1-7000","I hope the treasure is still there.",""
"149328292-1-7001","You know who has good cheese? Them Nords from Skyrim. Heard it was Mammoth's cheese. Goes great with a good red.",""
"149328292-1-7002","Give these monks a wide berth, walker. They still dance the Bent Dance.",""
"149328292-1-7003","Can Teifi help you find anything? This one is anxious to keep busy.",""
"149328292-1-7004","Pick your poison! Er, I don't sell actual poison. It's an expression.",""
"149328292-1-7005","I charge extra for each pet. And lice are pets.",""
"149328292-1-7006","Fire! Smoke!",""
"149328292-1-7007","No trespassing!",""
"149328292-2-6614","It looks like … yes, the challenger is trying again!",""
"149328292-2-6705","Isn't this great? You know you love it!",""
"149328292-2-6860","I never thought an Orcish city would have so many books! Perhaps our people really have turned a corner.",""
"149328292-2-6877","Fancy a fresh meal? Why not make your own? I've got everything you could need.",""
"149328292-2-6878","Remember, each bas-relief told a different part of the full story.",""
"149328292-2-6879","I miss Eastmarch, but the hunting here is so much better.",""
"149328292-2-6882","I'd like a chance to sample <<1>>'s latest dish!",""
"149328292-2-6884","We believed in her cooking before anyone else. Well, I did. I don't know about you.",""
"149328292-2-6891","Soon I'll taste your heart's blood!",""
"149328292-2-6892","Yar gor garag!",""
"149328292-2-6893","Yara ar yorag!",""
"149328292-2-6894","Fire will consume you!",""
"149328292-2-6895","We will make this quick.",""
"149328292-2-6896","You can die. We Daedra cannot!",""
"149328292-2-6898","I'll turn you to soot and cinders!",""
"149328292-2-6900","Your death means nothing to me.",""
"149328292-2-6903","You make it almost too easy!",""
"149328292-2-6906","Foolish creature! You only delay the inevitable.",""
"149328292-2-6907","This one is the true champion here!",""
"149328292-2-6908","Now you will suffer!",""
"149328292-2-6909","Grovel, and I'll kill you quickly!",""
"149328292-2-6910","You dare not touch the flames.",""
"149328292-2-6911","Now you will feel pain!",""
"149328292-2-6912","Die, Nirnspawn!",""
"149328292-2-6913","Bah! Our supply of webs is endless!",""
"149328292-2-6914","By the scales of the queen!",""
"149328292-2-6916","Stand and fight me!",""
"149328292-2-6917","I shall not be denied a good death!",""
"149328292-2-6919","You are my opponent?",""
"149328292-2-6921","Every tale they tell of you is a lie!",""
"149328292-2-6922","I've had enough of your insolence!",""
"149328292-2-6923","Fool! What else could you expect?",""
"149328292-2-6924","There could be no other end.",""
"149328292-2-6925","With my power, the Reach will attain the Ruby Throne once more!",""
"149328292-2-6926","Thank you, blessed mothers, for the gifts you give me!",""
"149328292-2-6927","The city is simply beautiful. It seems the king will leave a lasting legacy after all.",""
"149328292-2-6932","Disgraceful.",""
"149328292-2-6933","Alas, this one has no coats to sell—but there are other ways to keep warm, yes?",""
"149328292-2-6934","Somebody get me a stiff drink and a crutch before I start cracking skulls!",""
"149328292-2-6935","Are you headed back to the city? I need to see a healer. I'm in real pain here.",""
"149328292-2-6938","Don't think too hard about how it's made. Just eat.",""
"149328292-2-6939","You won't find better drinks. Unless you locate the Clockwork City.",""
"149328292-2-6940","Wrothgar is too cold, and Alik'r is too hot. This one spends time in both—it is the only way to find balance.",""
"149328292-2-6943","This one prefers gold to green baubles or blue stones. To crowns, to silver, platinum, and all other things. Gold is all that matters.",""
"149328292-2-6944","For a short time only! Priceless treasures could be yours!",""
"149328292-2-6956","The Orsimer have so long been trod upon by others, beaten down to rise again. Why not show them all — with your riches?",""
"149328292-2-6972","This will help the people of Orsinium.",""
"149328292-2-6974","The Orcs aren't all that excited about a Nord-run business inside the city walls, so they pushed us to the outskirts. Just as well. My customers like the quiet.",""
"149328292-2-6975","Way I hear it, the king's got a real taste for salmon. 'Course there's not much the king doesn't have a taste for, am I right?",""
"149328292-2-6976","You  break a barrel open, it comes out of your pay.",""
"149328292-2-6978","Look for a baby with a bat in its mouth! That's mine ….",""
"149328292-2-6979","Is someone listening?",""
"149328292-2-6980","It's a good thing I arrived when I did. These monks are in very poor shape.nnYou look a bit bedraggled as well. Can I help you find anything?",""
"149328292-2-6982","You can die. We Daedra cannot!",""
"149328292-2-7000","My father really buried his loot far away from the city.",""
"149328292-2-7001","I've known Falorah at least for half of her life. I am her cousin after all.",""
"149328292-2-7002","It is hard to watch, yes? We have given the monks moonsugar tonic and offered prayers in their name, but the rest …? The rest it up to them.nnTurap'su hopes that he will not have to bloody his sword.",""
"149328292-2-7003","What can Teifi get you? This one's stock is meager, but the Cantors have blessed every piece.",""
"149328292-2-7007","Go away!",""
"149328292-3-6614","Pay attention, you Daedra—it's never the same twice!",""
"149328292-3-6705","Ah, violence! It's just like a ballet, only with blood!",""
"149328292-3-6836","Got the best goods from all over Tamriel! Take a look.",""
"149328292-3-6878","Not everyone fully grasps the intricacies of solving puzzles. But go ahead and give it another try.",""
"149328292-3-6882","<<1>>'s cooking is the talk of Orsinium!",""
"149328292-3-6884","If we keep eating here, how will we fit into our armor?",""
"149328292-3-6892","Gar yarag go!",""
"149328292-3-6893","Aga yara yor!",""
"149328292-3-6895","Come closer, sweet thing!",""
"149328292-3-6898","Feel my burning rage!",""
"149328292-3-6900","My axe will make quick work of you.",""
"149328292-3-6907","This one's spells are supreme!",""
"149328292-3-6909","I'll scorch the skin from your bones!",""
"149328292-3-6913","Think that light can protect you? Not for long!",""
"149328292-3-6914","At the queen's command! Kill!",""
"149328292-3-6922","I'll slaughter you!",""
"149328292-3-6925","You have no love for my kind. I have none for yours. Come, let us complete the ritual.",""
"149328292-3-6932","Idiot.",""
"149328292-3-6933","Feel free to examine my goods. Yes, take a nice, long look.",""
"149328292-3-6943","Here to buy, to spend freely, or merely to talk? Talk without trade is vexing to some, you know.",""
"149328292-3-6944","Come, raise your gold, your money! Raise your riches!",""
"149328292-3-6972","These will be very useful in Cyrodiil!",""
"149328292-3-6976","We have a lot to move today, so no dogging it!",""
"149328292-3-6979","Hold up. We're not alone.",""
"149328292-3-6980","Quite a view, ay? Alas, there's no time to enjoy it. A merchant's work is never done.nnSpeaking of which, what can I do for you?",""
"149328292-3-7000","Let's get out there as soon as we can!",""
"149328292-3-7001","I don't really know much about this Cosh character, but Falorah seems to trust him enough to marry him. I guess that has to be good for something.",""
"149328292-3-7003","Teifi has traded in the shadow of many temples. This one is the spookiest.",""
"149328292-3-7006","<Cough> I'm getting out of here!",""
"149328292-3-7007","You are not allowed here!",""
"149328292-4-6609","Sanguine's red hat! What a blow!",""
"149328292-4-6614","And the challenger returns for another try!",""
"149328292-4-6656","May the harpies pick at your bones, blasphemous fools!",""
"149328292-4-6704","Did you see that? That's action!",""
"149328292-4-6705","The Maelstrom Arena! There's nothing like it in all Oblivion!",""
"149328292-4-6793","I am reborn. The master bids it, and I obey.",""

"200879108-0-40642","Well, it wouldn't surprise me. He can be very agitating.nnBut whatever's going on in there, I'm sure that Narsis Dren has the situation well in hand.",""
"200879108-0-40659","Well, we were supposed to wait until the nests were destroyed before heading inside to find the source of the briarhearts. But the Winterborn, they found us. Overwhelmed the soldiers. nnI ran. I'm not proud of it, but I'm alive. That's what matters.",""
"200879108-0-40698","Bazrag and the other clan chiefs know King Kurog all too well. They expect him to attack and kill the heretics, just as the heretics will kill the hostages.nnInnocent lives will be lost and blame will fall squarely on Kurog's shoulders.",""
"200879108-0-40700","Look, I just got back from a tour in Daggerfall and I'm still trying to figure this city out. It's a damn maze!nnI heard there might be a way back in, but the soldiers I sent to look for it haven't reported in yet.",""
"200879108-0-40719","High Priestess Solgra and our brothers and sisters in Trinimac.nnThe fanatics gathered us up and forced us in here. But Solgra, she isn't one to put up with such nonsense. She put a blade into one of them and ran into the back to help the others.",""
"200879108-0-40745","Yeah, maybe. This was our first time out on our own and things didn't go as planned.nnI'm responsible for what happened. Durga's death is on my shoulders. And on the Riekrs. But I don't want to lose any more of my friends.",""
"200879108-0-40746","With all the outsiders coming to Wrothgar, we wanted to prove our worth. Show we can handle ourselves. Gather meat, furs. Provide for the clan.nnNever expected to get ambushed by Riekrs, though. With your help, maybe we can make this right.",""
"200879108-0-40749","I know it sounds strange, but the Riekrs behaved like a raiding party. I even saw their leader bark commands in some gibberish language.nnIf I don't salvage this, make things right, I'll bring shame to my mother. She's the hunt-wife of our clan.",""
"200879108-0-40752","They headed toward the cave up in the cliffs the last time I saw them. Right after that Riekr got the drop on me.nnShould've been back by now. Maybe you can find them? I'll make my way back to the camp. As soon as my ears stop ringing.",""
"200879108-0-40756","That makes two of us. But I'm more concerned about my little brother. He ran off to find our friends with only his stupid cat to help him.nnLook, if you can convince Zhasim to get his arse out of there, I'd be grateful. Just watch out for the Riekrs.",""
"200879108-0-40757","Tracked? I guess so. They weren't really trying to hide their path. Unfortunately, they were waiting for us just outside the cave.nnSpeaking of which, did you happen to run into a big Orc named Murukh? One of the Riekrs cracked a rock on his head.",""
"200879108-0-40759","That Orgotha, always thinking! She'll make a great hunt-wife one of these days!nnI'm sure the Riekr leader is somewhere inside. Just find my brother and the others before you rile up the blue buggers. All this fighting is still kind of new to us.",""
"200879108-0-40770","That's what I'm doing! But I lost track of Zubesha and Thereg when Winks got away from me. And there are an awful lot of Riekrs in here.nnIf you find the hunters, I'll look for Winks. Sound good to you?",""
"200879108-0-40791","Possibly. Winks can slip through the smallest openings. But she could be in here somewhere. It's a big room. nnIf one of those Riekrs hurts my cat, they'll taste my blade.",""
"200879108-0-40830","They're wearing Orc armor, wielding Orc weapons, and their tusks have a jaunty tilt to them. I don't know, why would I think they're Orcs?nn<<1>> can tell you more. Can't believe I'm glad <<2>> brought him along.",""
"200879108-0-40848","Truly? Sounds like you could teach my clan a thing or two about holding a grudge.nnI have to ask about <<1>>. When you found him, was it … did he suffer?",""
"200879108-0-40849","Orsinium, most likely. If all I recovered is a tale of woe and terror, I might as well use it to earn some drinks. Walk where the echateres walk, my friend.nnUnless they have the flux. Then walk two paces to the right. Trust me on this.",""
"200879108-0-40851","Damn. You don't hold back, do you?nnStill, it sounds like he fought to the last. If he was an Orc, I'd petition to bury him at Sorrow. He should be honored for his sacrifice.",""
"200879108-0-40864","I will. Eventually. Maybe. I mean, look around!nnThese people are injured! What happens if the Winterborn come back? Someone has to protect them, keep them from being picked off one by one. Anyway, I'll keep them safe while you help Chief Bazrag.",""
"200879108-0-40866","They did. They've always been good to me. The hearth-mother. My brother Avreg. Osgotha and others. I'm an Orc, even if I don't look like one.nnBut … maybe my parents were rescued! Let's look for more clues. Maybe my Khajiit family is still alive!",""
"200879108-0-40880","The Agra Crun is all around, hidden in plain sight. In Orsinium, for example, waits one of the most powerful of our order.nnTake the scroll to Kroma, but keep it safe until you reach her. The Trinimac cult wants the truth destroyed at any cost.",""

"200879108-0-40889","Truly? Perhaps we can still recover the supplies the clans need to survive the winter. The decision to invite outsiders to our land has already reaped untold benefits!nnTell me, where have the Winterborn hidden the supplies?",""
"200879108-0-40896","I can tell you how long it takes steel to melt. You want old stories? Go ask a poet.",""
"200879108-0-40897","<<1>> thinks she's steel in a world full of iron. For all the king blusters, she'd challenge him at every turn. Her little sister is content to just run a forge—easy choice.nnAlso, I punched his mother.",""
"200879108-0-40905","Invaders from the Reach, the Winterborn. They're following a mad warlord named Urfon Ice-Heart on some insane quest to take our land. But we're not going to let that happen. We've got something the Reachmen don't. A secret weapon.nnOur echatere!",""
"200879108-0-40911","He's a chief! In charge of an Orc clan or something.nnIf you ask me, he's got more than a chip on his shoulder. It's a whole damn mountain! I don't think he's a big supporter of King Kurog, but he saved us before he went to help the peasants.",""
"200879108-0-40926","Well, look upon my husband and weep, for his next journey is to the Ashen Forge.",""
"200879108-0-40952","I'll live. But you need to find Zubesha. The Riekr chieftain dragged her off. Something bad is going to happen to her, I just know it.",""
"200879108-0-40982","If you're brave enough, talk to Lazghal and do whatever she asks. If you can finally get her to stop yelling at me, I'll go and listen to whatever Kurog wants to say.",""
"200879108-0-41012","Thirty years into the siege of Old Orsinium, <<1>> challenged <<2>> to determine its fate. As the defenders watched the duel, Shinji's Order of Diagna slipped inside and opened the city doors. My people were slaughtered.nnAnd then … it's unclear.",""
"200879108-0-41023","There are catacombs nearby with similar stonework to this tomb, but they're crawling with Winterborn. Try there—look for a monument stone of some kind.",""
"200879108-0-41029","I guess we could take him to High Priestess Solgra. She did send us to save him, after all.nnI'm sure I can sneak him into the city, as long as he cooperates and doesn't do anything stupid or anything.",""
"200879108-0-41036","It was, until a few minutes ago. Another king—that Breton king, Joile—just sent me a letter. Told me my fool brother <<1>> died to Breton forces at Orsinium.nnBut then he turned it into a job offer.",""
"200879108-0-41055","It was just following its nature. When I rebuilt it I altered it to be my assistant. The perfect helper as it were. I think it rolled into the camp to help the hunters do—well, whatever it is hunters do. Don't you understand? This is terrific news!",""
"200879108-0-41059","Shatul travels with the echatere. We have no prisons, just the Code of Malacath.nnIf you wrong another in the clan, you have two choices—pay in gold, or pay in blood.",""
"200879108-0-41063","It's nothing. Well … <<1>> went missing that night. When I caught her out in the snow, I heard someone singing.nnIt sounded like <<2>>, but I didn't stay to listen. If the chief's hunt-wife wants to sing alone at night, that's her business.",""
"200879108-0-41065","Oh? About what?",""
"200879108-0-41089","The king will know the truth. This is <<1>>'s tomb, and altering any piece of it will mar his legend. The king won't dare touch <<2>>'s remains—especially not once I write Sentinel with the news.nnLet the kings argue with each other, if they must.",""
"200879108-0-41180","More than enough to serve brain pockets at the competition!nnI do believe I perfected the recipe with my earlier batch. Would you care for a taste? They're especially crisp!",""
"200879108-0-41182","Isn't it juicy? The grass casing draws the bile from the brain mash, which gives it a good snap.nnThis is an old recipe from Shatul. They travel well, and the <<z:1>> is a natural preservative.",""
"200879108-0-41183","Just a taste? It would help me know if it was ready for competition.",""

"200879108-0-41197","<<1>> poisons her mind with denial. I refuse to pay for a crime I did not commit.",""
"200879108-0-41198","I will not dishonor my husband's memory by fighting you.nnBut if I stay, <<1>>'s grief will turn to hate. I … I will leave the clan.",""
"200879108-0-41199","Giving away your own coin so <<1>> can gain satisfaction? This isn't your affair. Why would you do this?",""
"200879108-0-41201","Then we shall fight. Meet me by the river, so I can feed it with your blood.",""
"200879108-0-41206","Since you're paying for it, I don't see why not. It's good, strong stuff.",""
"200879108-0-41209","Perfect! Ventricle pie requires the freshest ingredients. <<Cmz:1>> don't exactly keep unless you bake them quickly.nnI have one last slice from my previous attempt. You're welcome to it!",""
"200879108-0-41211","I'm not asking you to eat the whole thing. But if you don't mind, I'd like to know if it's good enough to round out a meal.",""
"200879108-0-41213","Surprising, isn't it? A bit nutty from the moss, but the intestinal quiche contrasts well with the vascular cream pockets. Chewy, too!nnIn the halls of Old Orsinium, no meal was complete until they served ventricle pie.",""
"200879108-0-41237","Dig in! The lichen is key to the broth. You may notice the tomato base draws out the subtler taste of the truffles.",""
"200879108-0-41238","Bear meat is usually disgusting, but those of northern Wrothgar survive on a diet of fish. And the marrow makes for a delicious stew!nnI can't wait to serve up <<1>>'s head. I hope there'll be a subtle hint of coffee.",""
"200879108-0-41239","You aren't a fan of a dish that comes with its own container? Are you sure you can't make an exception? Just one ladle-full?",""
"200879108-0-41255","The Vosh Rakh want to make a statement. Something big. Bazrag thinks it involves the moot, where all the chiefs will be gathered.nnWe need more information. Someone needs to enter the old Trinimac temple to the west and learn more about their plans.",""
"200879108-0-41274","Honor the clans who carved out a mountainside to raise these walls—those who armed, fed, and ruled this city in its prime.nnHonor the clans who built a city worthy of my attention.",""
"200879108-0-41311","Then go forth and receive your clan.nnShatul, I present your new chief!",""
"200879108-0-41318","As you can see, we've been rather busy ourselves, so I haven't had a chance to get the entire story out of Eveli.nnTell me, what else did you learn at Paragon's Remembrance?",""
"200879108-0-41319","Solgra doesn't have a bounty on her head—at least not yet. She went back to the temple. Business as usual, and all that.nnWhat a mess Kurog has made. He thinks we're the traitors, but his mother is running a cult right under his nose.",""
"200879108-0-41320","By the sacred tusk, the forge-mother? The Vosh Rakh answer to Alga? That's … well, come to think of it, that makes a certain amount of sense.nnThe cowards blame the high priestess and then get to smell like sunshine on a cloudy day.",""
"200879108-0-41324","I assumed as much. That's why I decided to appear in this manner. That way we can talk freely, without one of us deciding to be gauche and draw a weapon or otherwise behave badly.",""
"200879108-0-41325","Oh, but we already have, don't you see?nnThe clan chiefs have gathered and the moot is about to start. Soon the news will spread that Solgra is behind the Vosh Rakh. Everything's in place, just as I have foreseen. You have failed, outsider.",""
"200879108-0-41326","The time for endless talk and debate is over. These cowards who call themselves chiefs will soon be removed and no one will remain to say no to my son. It's for the best.nnOh, and I haven't forgotten Bazrag. We'll get him too, in the end.",""
"200879108-0-41342","Haven't you and your friends caused us enough trouble already?nnAll right, if you get me my inn back, I'll try to forget that any of this ever happened. So, how can I help?",""
"200879108-0-41344","Never seen her before. I make it a habit to get to know all of the guards and soldiers who come to the inn to unwind.nnFrom the look on her face, she hasn't unwound since the king was a cub tied to the Forge-Mother's apron.",""
"200879108-0-41353","I was running messages … for the cute Wood Elf and the grumpy Orc ….nnWhen I returned … the soldiers rushed in … stabbed me.",""
"200879108-0-41354","They never saw it coming. The soldiers grabbed the Orc chief and the Elf … took them away. By the order of … the king.nnI guess I was … just in the way.",""
"200879108-0-41356","So proud. So sure. So certain that you do the right thing. But you defy the will of Trinimac and try to stop the inevitable by warning my son.nnIn short, you have begun to annoy me.",""
"200879108-0-41357","No, we're done here. You think you know so much, but you're just grasping at straws.nnThe plan proceeds and you can't stop it. The Orsimer will rally as one under the banner of King Kurog. I have foreseen it!",""
"200879108-0-41358","The Vosh Rakh do exactly what they've been ordered to do. They will eliminate every obstacle that threatens my son. It's time to remove the clan chiefs so that Orsimer unification can begin.nnThis is about survival! Surely, you can understand that?",""
"200879108-0-41359","I admit I never trusted you. But you've helped our people. You deserved better than to fall to the forge-mother.nnI dragged you back here before the Vosh Rakh arrived, healed you as best I could. Now get out of here before the soldiers find you.",""
"200879108-0-41361","The chiefs have already headed to the moot and Vosh Rakh guard the keep. If you want to survive, you have to leave now.nnI don't want to fight you, but if you decide to go after the king … well, I am sworn to protect my beloved.",""
"200879108-0-41362","My beloved does what he must to unite our people. You know this is true. You've seen it. The clan chiefs refuse to listen.nnIf Kurog fails, the Orsimer will never be anything more than the abused and scorned wretches the other races imagine us to be.",""
"200879108-0-41367","Not sure. I slipped inside before Kurog locked down the keep. Found you lying on the floor and dragged you back here before all the Vosh Rakh showed up.nnI thought they were Orsimer soldiers at first, but those are definitely the cultists up there.",""
"200879108-0-41368","You go ahead. Just watch yourself. Those Vosh Rakh maniacs aren't going to stand aside and let you march in there.nnI'll go gather some other allies in the city. If you run into problems, meet me outside the keep and we'll figure something else out.",""
"200879108-0-41369","They headed for the moot. It's going to start soon.nnKurog and the chiefs don't realize what they're walking into. It's going to be a blood bath!",""
"200879108-0-41370","Ah. The poor girl is still young. She can't accept that our husband fell in fair combat.nnThere is no conspiracy, just a good man who fell before his time. Tell her that.",""
"200879108-0-41371","You rummaged through my tent? If you weren't blood-kin, I could gut you for that.nnNot that my things are your business, but it's a book of battle poetry. I read them occasionally.",""
"200879108-0-41372","His sword jangles—lots of little buckles on the scabbard—but mine is quieter than a thief. I bet he didn't want to wake me, the morning he was injured.nnDamned fool, trying to prove himself. Didn't want his hunt-wife along to fight the giant.",""
"200879108-0-41373","You better not be pulling my tusk, outsider.nnI've known Kurog for a long time. We may disagree on certain issues, but he's always had the best interests of our people in mind. This makes no sense!",""
"200879108-0-41374","There are still some people here in the city that I can count on.nnNow do whatever you have to and get to the moot. If you run into any problems, find me outside the keep and we'll figure something out.",""
"200879108-0-41375","Then there isn't any time to waste. Give me the key and head for the throne room. There's a passage in there that will lead you directly to the moot.nnI'll get Eveli to safety and try to gather some additional help.",""
"200879108-0-41384","It's what they preach in Orsinium, isn't it? Always wise to keep in touch with the king's politics.nnBetter to know the old myths than sound like a bumpkin.",""
"200879108-0-41385","Let me see that ….nnYou can get to the moot through the temple? I had no idea that path even existed! But they sent soldiers after Solgra. That's bad. We need a new plan and we need it now.",""
"200879108-0-41388","You go ahead to the temple and check on the high priestess.nnEveli and I have one more place where we can look for some help. If we're successful, it might make the path to the moot slightly less complicated.",""
"200879108-0-41389","I'm well aware of that! I'm counting on the start of the moot to keep them distracted, but we won't take any unnecessary chances.nnWe need Solgra alive to tell her side of the story. Then we can get to the moot and save the chiefs.",""
"200879108-0-41402","That's my hunting blade! <<1>> must have grabbed it on his way to the giant camp.nnCareful how you handle it. The blade has a paralyzing poison on the edge.",""
"200879108-0-41403","You see? A cultist chants to her Daedric Prince, just like the stories.nnI bet she was cavorting in the moonlight. Perhaps she was chanting to ensorcell <<1>>!",""
"200879108-0-41404","I name you my champion. Go to <<1>> and demand the blood price. She must pay in gold or blood.nnReturn to me when the debt is paid. Then I can put my husband to rest.",""
"200879108-0-41405","This is enough evidence for me to demand the blood price from <<1>>.",""
"200879108-0-41407","Of course! What do you want to know?",""
"200879108-0-41423","Shatul will survive. A new hunt-wife will take my place.nnAs a girl, my dreams were of hunts in distant lands. Now, as a widow, they shall be reality.",""
"200879108-0-41424","I don't take charity … but this isn't charity. It will help <<1>> get past our husband's death. It will bring Shatul together.nnTell her I will pay her the blood price directly. Then, perhaps we can speak of what both of us lost.",""
"200879108-0-41425","Solgra … Solgra says the arrow just missed my heart. Never knew an Orc who could shoot worth a damn, anyway. Well, except for those catapulteers back at Frostbreak. They were pretty amazing.nnSo, be honest with me. Am I going to be all right?",""
"200879108-0-41426","I used to think he was a good ruler. Strong, honorable. But he's a menace. He's let himself become more important than his ideas.nnSo go and do what you do so well. I'll wait right here. Recovering. I want to be ready for the next adventure.",""
"200879108-0-41427","That bad, huh? Well, don't worry about me. You've got more important things to deal with. Like the clan chiefs.nnYou're going to go after Kurog, aren't you?",""
"200879108-0-41440","If this is about that incident with the fanatics, you should take it up with the king.nnIn these difficult times, misunderstandings can quickly spiral out of control and lead to situations we'd all rather avoid.",""
"200879108-0-41442","But … but … oh, very well. When the king's soldiers banged on the doors, she ran up the stairs and outside. The soldiers knocked us aside and chased after her.nnI don't know what Solgra did, but she's clearly made someone very angry.",""
"200879108-0-41443","Vosh Rakh? I don't understand. But no, they didn't hurt me. Not for lack of trying, though.nnSo tell me, what kind of trouble are we in now?",""
"200879108-0-41444","We can't allow that to happen! But why have you come to help me? The clan chiefs are more important. You should be at the moot, doing whatever you can to foil the king's dastardly plan.",""
"200879108-0-41445","I feared as much. Only they have the influence needed to pull of a scheme so grand. And Kurog has been getting desperate of late.nnI'll worry about this later. There is no time now. What can we do to stop them?",""
"200879108-0-41450","We were just … it was supposed to …. The captain's worked for my father for years. My father. You just can't say no to him. He said that the captain would take care of everything.nnBy the gods, what have I done? Sovelle will never forgive me.",""
"200879108-0-41473","I expected you'd say that. Take this. It will open the cells in the dungeon below the keep.nnJust take your friends far from this place and let my beloved finish his mission to elevate our people.",""
"200879108-0-41474","Brazen ignorance. Of course.nnYou don't understand what you ask. <<1>> has a special place in my legend, and I in hers.",""
"200879108-0-41476","In this tomb are the items I used to win over <<1>>'s trust.nnReturn each to its proper home, so you may return to yours.",""
"200879108-0-41485","As much as it galls me to help him, Kurog needs to be warned. He's in as much danger as the clan chiefs, especially if Alga plans to usurp her son.nnYou go talk to Kurog. I'll send Eveli to protect Solgra.",""
"200879108-0-41486","Let me see that …. nnYou can get to the moot through the temple? I had no idea that path existed. But they sent soldiers? I hope Eveli can handle things until we get there.",""
"200879108-0-41488","You go ahead and check on the Wood Elf. I'll meet you there.nnI have one more place where I can look for some help. If I'm successful, it might make the path to the moot slightly less complicated.",""
"200879108-0-41489","I'm well aware of that! I'm counting on the start of the moot to keep them distracted, but I won't take any unnecessary chances.nnBesides, I was supposed to be dead by now.",""
"200879108-0-41490","You? Well … you are the first Shatul blood-kin since <<1>>. And you did avenge my son.nnYou, an exile, or a weakling … yes, the choice is obvious. I could make this work.",""
"200879108-0-41491","The clan would never accept an Orc woman as chief … unless she was highly regarded by the clan. Which you are, for avenging my son.nnAnd if the choice is between you, an exile, or a weakling … yes. This could work.",""

"200879108-0-41864","What's this? A funeral for Kurog? I'd be honored to represent the priesthood at such a solemn event. Perhaps the chief sees a place for Trinimac in the days ahead. I hope so.nnNo matter. The city needs to heal. I'll do what I can to help with that.",""
"200879108-0-41865","Now that King Kurog and the forge-mother are gone, the temple is going to be rededicated to Malacath. It's a shame, but I can't blame the clan chiefs. Not after all that trouble with the Vosh Rakh.",""

"200879108-0-41923","The chiefs and I discussed this. We think it's better to remember Kurog for who he was rather than vilify him as a tyrant.nnWe honor the Orc I knew as a friend, not the one I fought with as a rival and an enemy.",""
"200879108-0-41924","We fought side-by-side long ago. When he left Wrothgar to become a mercenary, I went with him. It was a glorious time!nnBut I had responsibilities to return to. When next I saw my friend, he was making his own challenge to become chief of his clan.",""
"200879108-0-41928","Well, I don't know ""Chief"" Bazrag, but Bazrag the Butcher? Him and me go way back! We were all part of Gaspard's Stalker's, the best mercenary company to ever fight its way across Hammerfell and Elsweyr.nnBut you don't want to hear old war stories.",""
"200879108-0-41929","Let me see that. Interesting. So Bazrag wants to give Kurog a traditional Orsimer requiem, does he? I heard that the king was dead. I guess this confirms it.nnBut I'll be a harpy's hairdresser if I can figure out how you're involved in all this.",""
"200879108-0-41930","You couldn't take a moment to send a message to old friends? Yeah, well, maybe Bazrag can set us up with work after the funeral. I'll have to ask him about that.nnI hope they're going to have food at this thing.",""

"200879108-0-41935","What's this? A funeral? For Kurog?nnI'd be honored to represent Solgra and the temple at this solemn event. Not because I have any love for the mad king, but because I see Bazrag's wisdom. The city needs to heal. I'll do what I can to help with that.",""
"200879108-0-41941","A letter? Isn't that how all this trouble started in the first place?nnBut I guess I might as well see this through to the end. And you'll be there, right? Me and you, once more into the breach. Hopefully without anyone trying to kill us this time.",""
"200879108-0-41966","They are. They are. nnOr … or maybe they're not! When I see you fighting in an arena, I can almost remember the baron who made it. To defeat an arena, you almost have to become its creator, and then, for me, that baron lives again! Briefly.",""

"200879108-0-42536","What? You looking to court her or something?nnIf you're so enthralled by Captain What's Her Name, I heard her tell a soldier she'd be by the ramparts near the stables. But she's a cold fish, mark my words. You'd do better fishing in a different pond.",""
"200879108-0-42537","That was the first thing they confiscated. It was Sergeant Vulmon. I know him. He's one of our regulars. Usually friendly, leaves an extra gold piece now and again.nnHe's stationed near the King's Cornerclub. But he won't give up that key.",""
"200879108-0-42538","That's between you and him. I'll have no part in that. I'm no criminal, despite how all this looks.",""
"200879108-0-42539","To be honest, I was kind of busy trying to not get arrested at the time.nnWait a moment! Yes, I know. He said something about the bath house before he left. Anyway, I hope that's where he went. He'll need to soak for hours to get rid of that smell!",""
"200879108-0-42540","Well, there might be a way. There was a merchant here earlier. Smelled like fermented echatere cheese that was left out in the sun. But he was awfully friendly with the soldiers.nnMaybe a little too friendly, if you catch my meaning.",""
"200879108-0-42542","A person in my line of business, well, we hear things. Secret things. Dangerous things. Things concerning clan chiefs and fanatics with a little too much holiness in their hair.",""
"200879108-0-42543","By giving you this key, my friend.nnYou'd be surprised at how much you can accomplish by slipping some gold into a purse. Even a soldier's purse. So, go help your friends. With this, I consider my debt to you paid in full.",""
"200879108-0-42544","You need to get into the inn. I can get you into the inn. Tit for tat, as the Bretons say.nnNow, I don't know exactly what's going on, and I don't want to know. But I don't like those new soldiers. There's something not right about them.",""
"200879108-0-42545","I don't really know. Most giants are surly enough. <<1>>, we've come to learn, is a mean drunk.nnOnce, he tore off an echatere's crest and tossed it across the snow like he was skipping a stone. Heard they found it in Fharun Stronghold.",""
"200879108-0-42546","You're right. Only made it a hundred paces before it slammed into a tree.nnTook half a day to saw that bloody crest out. We tried to reattach the thing, but the echatere wanted nothing to do with it.",""
"200879108-0-42551","Well … of course. That's how it's always been.nnHmm. Never thought about it any other way. I suppose it's possible. Still, I wouldn't wish that on any woman.",""
"200879108-0-42556","What? No, of course not. I get paid to tell people exactly what I told you.nnAfter that, well, I've done my duty. They don't pay me enough to tangle with someone like you.",""
"200879108-0-42557","Suit yourself. Just let them know that I said my words and gave you fair warning.nnI might not be a true believer, but I want to keep my job, if it's all the same to you.",""
"200879108-0-42558","I'm no guard. I'm watchman. It's a dull job, but it's a living.nnThose soldiers up there? They're a strange bunch. Never knew soldiers who were so religious. Everything's Trinimac this and Trinimac that. I just want to finish my shift in peace.",""
"200879108-0-42559","Huh. Sometimes I ask myself the same question.nnI'm a contract broker for the Dragonstar Caravan Company. We've been drowning in contracts ever since Kurog started his little home decorating project. We just don't have the manpower to keep up.",""
"200879108-0-42562","You are the chief. And I have no standing to disobey. Not anymore.nnI will not pay the blood price. If you order me to leave, I shall depart.",""
"200879108-0-42563","Oh, a bit of this and that. Minor healing spells, basic transmutation, a sprinkling of mysticism. Oh—and fire juggling! Would you like to see?",""
"200879108-0-42564","Well, I … that's quite rude!nnWould a transmutation spell tickle your fancy? Perhaps I could turn you into a toad! You already act the part.",""
"200879108-0-42565","Wonderful! Stand back!",""
"200879108-0-42566","That sounds serious. But this is a time for celebration! The next age of the Orsimer people begins today!",""
"200879108-0-42567","You dare to question my actions? To imply that I don't have the best interests of my people in mind?nnIf you must know, we received word of the location of the traitors. I sent my soldiers to capture them for interrogation.",""
"200879108-0-42568","Really? In danger you say? And you came upon this knowledge how?nnIf you're frightened by a few idle rumors in the streets ….",""
"200879108-0-42569","Keep your voice down! Do you know how easy it is to panic a clan chief? We just got them here, so let's not scare them away needlessly.nnMeet me down in the dining hall and we can continue this discussion in private.",""
"200879108-0-42570","More questions? You're beginning to try my patience. nnBut let's not talk about such matters in front of the clan chiefs. Meet me down in the dining hall and we can continue this discussion in private.",""
"200879108-0-42571","What? How dare you spread such false accusations! Has Bazrag filled your head with more of his Malacath lies?nnI won't hear such things, not on the verge of my greatest victory!",""
"200879108-0-42572","Stop me? I don't think so!nnThe Orsimer will rally as one under King Kurog's banner! I have foreseen it!",""
"200879108-0-42573","My beloved believes that this is the only way to accomplish his dream.nnAs his shield-wife, I will support him. Just as I always have.",""
"200879108-0-42576","It worked, didn't it. The chiefs have gathered for the moot and everything proceeds as planned.nnAs long as you take Bazrag with you when you leave, there won't be any reason for more bloodshed. He served his purpose. Just like you.",""
"200879108-0-42577","No. He hoped that the chiefs would come to believe in his vision, to see the future he imagined just as he did.nnHe never wanted it to come to this. But a king must always do the right thing for his people.",""
"200879108-0-42578","Why would they do that? They'll see a king who fought the fanatical Vosh Rakh, who tried desperately to save the chiefs against overwhelming odds.nnWhen the dust clears, they will love him and stand united beneath his banner for all the world to see.",""
"200879108-0-42579","Kurog is my beloved and I swore an oath to support and protect him.nnBesides, I believe in the king's dream. I believe in a united Orsimer nation. It's the best way for us to take our place as equals among the other races.",""
"200879108-0-42581","My beloved doesn't hate Bazrag. They were friends once. Almost brothers. If anything, he's disappointed in the chief.nnBut Bazrag challenges the king. He needs to be removed from the field of battle before he has a chance to disrupt the plan.",""
"200879108-0-42582","Oh, the clan chiefs are far from innocent. And their deaths will serve a higher purpose. They represent a worthy sacrifice.nnNow, take your friends and go. This isn't your concern any longer. Let my beloved finish what he began. Please.",""
"200879108-0-42583","Only how little I knew about my own people! Clans appear and disappear as time passes, yet each contributes in some significant way to our culture.nnFor example, take Morkul clan.",""
"200879108-0-42584","Morkul clan can be traced back to Old Orsinium—beyond that, actually. They disappeared for centuries after the fall of Old Orsinium, then once more revealed themselves to Tamriel.nnI have asked where they went, but it is apparently a clan secret!",""
"200879108-0-42585","You've heard of the lost home of Morkul clan? It took me years to learn of the place!",""
"200879108-0-42596","I lived in Orsinium for years. Sometimes I forget Shatul is home.nnJust find the <<z:1>>. It's cold out here.",""
"200879108-0-42597","He'd have tried to kill you.nnBut you slew <<1>>. I expect <<2>> would now be dead.",""
"200879108-0-42601","It was my son's favorite food. His hearth-wife—she has dozens of recipes. He loved them all.nnHe won't be able to taste it. His mind, you see … there's nothing left of him. But I'll mix it into the poison so he enjoys it one last time.",""
"200879108-0-42602","The poison I shall feed the husk that remains of his body.",""
"200879108-0-42605","There is no shame in that. You are not an Orc. You are not of Shatul.nnBut you are blood-kin to our clan. Know that it must be done, and that only I can carry this burden. Shatul must survive.",""
"200879108-0-42607","I doubt that. An Orc of Shatul would truly understand. You are neither.nnYet you are blood-kin to our clan, and your words give me the strength to do what must be done. Shatul must survive.",""
"200879108-0-42608","Do you, truly? Were you a stronghold Orc, raised behind thick walls? Can you understand why I alone must carry this burden?nnForgive me. You are blood-kin to our clan. The only thing you must understand is that Shatul must survive.",""
"200879108-0-42609","Shatul must survive.nnBefore a new chief is chosen, the old chief must die. By the time <<1>> and <<2>> reach the Bloody Knoll, the poison will finish its work. Malacath will take no offense.",""
"200879108-0-42613","Yes, that's … you're right. How did you know it was me?",""
"200879108-0-42614","I knew it, the tuskless bastard! He plans to kill the chiefs and unite the clans over the corpses of our people. Despicable!nnThey're holding the moot in the mountains overlooking the city. A path beyond the throne room leads right to it.",""
"200879108-0-42615","Before Kurog started all this, I honestly never gave it a lot of thought. It certainly goes against all our most-cherished traditions.nnI have to admit, there are advantages to a united Orc nation. But not this way. Not this way.",""
"200879108-0-42616","I assume that he and Alga had it in mind, just in case. I can't help wonder if this is my fault, though. I should have talked to Kurog, listened to what he had to say.nnInstead, I turned away. I refused to hear him out. And now look where we are.",""
"200879108-0-42617","Who can say? I want to believe that Kurog started out with the best intentions. He thought the death of Ice-Heart would unite us under his banner.nnBut the clan chiefs, they're a stubborn lot.",""
"200879108-0-42618","People believe whatever's right in front of them. By throwing me in my own prison and making sure no one could talk to me, Kurog could direct the story to his own purposes.nnThe fanatics shouted my name, and that's all the people heard.",""
"200879108-0-42619","I have a reputation. Most of the chiefs and their clans respect me. That makes me a threat to Kurog's plans.nnBy discrediting me, Alga and her son give the people someone to hate. Then they can remove me from the field of battle without consequence.",""
"200879108-0-42620","Some of Kurog's ideas have merit, I'll give him that. nnBut the cost he's willing to bear to see his plans through to fruition? Murder. A city built on fresh graves. And the madness doesn't end there.",""
"200879108-0-42621","We're strong. The strongest people in Tamriel. But there's no way the Orcs could stand against the combined might of eight other nations.nnKurog has a different opinion. But he's wrong. He'll march us to glory and all we'll find is mass extinction.",""
"200879108-0-42622","You've seen our so-called king in action. You know him as well as anyone. Perhaps better. What do you think?nnHis pride will eventually be his downfall—and the downfall of his newly formed Orc nation.",""
"200879108-0-42623","No, it doesn't. With a united nation at his beck and call, Kurog assembles an army. And then he points that army at our supposed enemies.nnSuddenly it's the Orsimer against the world, for good or ill.",""
"200879108-0-42631","Birds! Catching and selling. It's been a lean season, what with all these strange storms along the coast. But I still turn a healthy profit.nnYou're not in the bird business, are you?",""
"200879108-0-42632","We shall build my Maelstrom Army, and make it a force to be feared in every corner of Oblivion!",""
"200879108-0-42633","I am a master of martial knowledge, a sage of combat. I am a piece of my prince, and a reflection of his glory, just as the glory of my conquests will be reflected in him.",""
"200879108-0-42634","It is not a name, it's a title, awarded to me for my achievements in mastering the ways of battle of the Deadlands. nnThe secrets of Dagon's warriors are no secret to me.",""
"200879108-0-43240","Rum? Rum?!nnThat's a pirates drink. Not a nobles. Ugh, that's disgusting. I'm going to go need to cleanse my palette just thinking of that stuff. Please excuse me.",""
"200879108-0-42676","We're working in the residential district now, making houses safe and sound. And not a moment too soon, what with all this talk of traitors and cultists in our midst!",""
"200879108-0-42728","I had hoped to run into my old friend Darien here. This is just the sort of situation he loved to find himself in.nnI know something happened in Coldharbour, but I can't believe he's dead. He's out there, somewhere. I can feel it in my bones.",""
"200879108-0-42744","There's enough of the fanatics left to be a pain in my side, but we have ways of separating the bad from the good.nnIt might take a while, but we'll put an end to the Vosh Rakh before too long.",""
"200879108-0-42882","Smuggling skooma, that's what! Have you seen what that stuff does to Khajiit? Some of my friends are cats, and if one of them were to get strung out on the stuff …nnWell, I won't be a part of it.",""
"200879108-0-42820","And here I am, all the way from the icy nethers of Wrothgar, to officially welcome you and transport you to Orsinium.nnOf course, I'm also supposed to make sure you're willing to do a little hard work. There's no room for shirkers on my wagon.",""
"200879108-0-42915","Let me see … Ah! The Violet Lamp wouldn't be happy if they knew about this! Give them their due, they really are fanatics for law and order.nnIt looks like those ""prominent citizens"" are even worse criminals than the Thieves Guild!",""
"200879108-0-42875","She is more likely to listen to you than to me. As I said, she and I don't get along. Though we can and did work jobs together if it was required. nnI think if the Iron Wheel s banging at her walls, she'll at least come in to talk.",""
"200879108-0-42835","Anyone who talks back to the Yard Boss or questions her wages being docked for some imagined slight … disappears. The Yard Boss and the Overseer say they just quit, but who quits a job and leaves all their gear behind?",""
"200879108-0-42921","What sort of change, hmm? Shake a bit of that dirt off, and get you a more fitting ensemble, and you might be something to look at.nnCome on, you look like someone with something specific in mind.",""
"200879108-0-42771","Tempting, but I need to find my own way for a while.nnBut no matter where the wind blows, leaves from the same tree eventually find each other again. That'll be the same for us. You'll see.",""
"200879108-0-42651","You're not supposed to eat the <<z:1>>! It draws out the <<z:2>> from the brain mash.nnGive it a few moments. I had a similar experience in the kitchen.",""
"200879108-0-42639","Sure do. And more importantly, they pay top coin to do it.nnI don't judge. We've all got hobbies. Far as I'm concerned, people can dress up like Molag Bal himself if they're willing to pay me this much to make it happen.",""
"200879108-0-42673","I oversee all the workers, develop the plans for repairs and new construction, order supplies … it keeps me busy! Luckily, we had a good foundation to build upon. The Orcs that came before us certainly made things to last!",""
"200879108-0-43324","We were taking food and supplies to Orsinium. Once there, everything was supposed to be distributed to the outlying clans to help them make it through the winter.nnWithout those supplies, many Orcs will die. I don't want to be responsible for that.",""
"200879108-0-43260","Hah! That's a beauty right there. Time to go to my happy place.nnDoubt Falorah is going to need me any time soon. Not with all that make up she has to put on.",""
"200879108-0-43232","There is nothing more for you to do in Abah's Landing? You are sure?",""
"200879108-0-43208","I think they want Val, and I think they're why he's been missing.nnVal was connected with the local Thieves Guild. He was … quite good at what he did. He bought this manor, and sent quite a lot of money overseas, I guess to take care of this woman.",""
"200879108-0-43278","The wedding's starting soon. Get in there and disable as many guards as you can once everything starts. Don't be seen though.nnIf this whole thing happens like I think it will, we'll need to high tail it out of here.",""
"200879108-0-43168","Our lives have two sides. For a Twilight Cantor, there is wine and song, but horror also.nnAdara'hai has struggled with this all her life. When dro-m'Athra appear, we are oath-bound to send them back to the Darks. It is … just the price we pay.",""
"200879108-0-43140","I'm flattered! Are you sure you want me to go with you?",""
"200879108-0-43076","A good leader… except when she gets captured. nnVery well. What's the plan? Do we rush into the ruins yelling like crazed Ashlanders, waving our daggers about threateningly? Or did little miss Quen have a great idea that sent her running off?",""
"200879108-0-43048","Who told you that? That milk-drinking Dark Elf, the one with his nose in the clouds?nnThose skeevers raided Bleakrock for years, and I'll marry an Argonian before I'll have an elf working under my roof. Dark Elves are nothing but trouble.",""
"200879108-0-43036","Ha ha ha! Kireth! Yes, I remember the lass. I just about split my gut when I heard her yowling. Sounded like a cat in heat.nnIf that's what they call singing in Deshaan, I really need to visit.",""
"200879108-0-43008","Excellent! Were you able to use the evidence you and Silver-Claws collected?",""
"200879108-0-42996","Ah! This one is most grateful. Most grateful. Did you learn anything else about her brazen act?nnAnd was she inconvenienced in any way? I do hope so.",""
"200879108-0-42984","I'll do better than that. It was so strange, I wrote it down.nn""The Lamp conquers the shadow.""",""
"200879108-0-42956","Negotiations? How can this one negotiate when these shaveskins refuse to compromise?nnWhat say you, Qamal? Will you bend or break?",""
"200879108-0-43042","You're paying me? To pay her? To fix my boat? That's the craziest thing I've ever heard, and my boatswain's a Nord who claims he's a wereskeever!nnThis is rich! Go ahead, send your girl. What you've paid will cover fixing her work and a small profit.",""
"200879108-0-43030","Well, not the tavern. The barkeep hired me as a barmaid and these ""sailors"" couldn't keep their paws to themselves. After I broke a few unwelcome fingers, the barkeep fired me.nnAlso, the captain of the Rowdy Guar is a cheat. She's on the docks.",""
"200879108-0-42932","You're kind of spooky, actually. Maybe you'll be all right.nnAnyway, just be careful on your contracts. If someone really is targeting the Dark Brotherhood, we've got to stay sharp.",""
"200879108-0-42714","Yes, something between a belch and a chipmunk chirp. I'm still working out the kinks. Just focus on cleansing the corruption, all right?",""
"200879108-0-42794","Ha! You've spent too much time around me, Tamahl.",""
"200879108-0-42898","I … what? No. Of course not. I found my family here, and I love each of them as I would my own child. This is the path I was meant to walk, and leading this sanctuary is my greatest pride. My family is all I need.",""
"200879108-0-43110","Wait … you got attacked by the Violet Lamp in the middle of a job and still got out with the treasure? That's amazing!nnLook, you have to join the Thieves Guild, now! The Lamp already thinks your one of us—you may as well gain the benefits, too.",""
"200879108-0-43087","More treasures likely to be hidden away. If you want to maximize profit, you grab as much as you can from those secluded passes. But only if you're confident you'll get the job done.nnWe won't be getting any extra time to pull that off.",""
"200879108-0-43095","I don't know whether to thank you or curse you. I should have been married by now.nnI've been looking through Rhanbiq's evidence. He has some circumstantial information about Lord Cosh. The evidence on your friend Danni is far more substantial.",""
"200879108-0-43151","The servants keep some spare clothing in baskets around the fort. See if you can find one and you should be able to replace your disguise.nnBut you need to find those pass-phrases!",""
"200879108-0-42925","Oh, my, so it's a burial suit you want! I don't know if you're aware, but the Violet Lamp aren't letting anyone into their crumbling old fort except prisoners and servants.nnWait a moment. That might be it. How do you feel about a servant's outfit?",""
"200879108-0-43071","Anything! Where is she being held? What do you need me to do?",""
"200879108-0-42679","Bears, you say? Did you notice if one of them was Norgim by any chance? She's a monster, that one. Maybe a hunt-wife would go after a bear like that, but not me.nnMaybe I'll look for a few rabbits, just to be on the safe side.",""
"200879108-0-42837","I am Corvus Evicus, Speaker for the Dark Brotherhood. My voice is the will of the Night Mother. She's been watching you. You are already an agent of death, but one aimless without a master. I come bearing a gift. An opportunity to join our family.",""
"200879108-0-42908","I've only just begun my investigations, but I've discovered two sources of information. There's a dockworker who's afraid for her life and a sailor greatly disgruntled with her captain.nnBoth seem like they want to talk to someone.",""
"200879108-0-42885","That's a name I haven't heard in quite some time. Perhaps the rumors aren't true after all.nnTell me, the Thieves Guild isn't behind the disappearances among the dockworkers, is it?",""
"200879108-0-42649","You pick up the axe. Others pick up their axes. When I count down from three, you Chop.",""
"200879108-0-42276","I had no idea it was the Blademaster himself! nnIn those days I sought to learn from anyone who knew how to wield a blade. He had a way about him … an inherent confidence in movement.",""
"200879108-0-42624","<<1>> is a fine warrior … better than my father. But that's the problem—he never challenged my father. He's like an echatere bull that refuses to mate, no matter how much ginger pulp you feed him.",""
"200879108-0-42635","No, not a thing. But I'll tell you a secret. The stronghold protects the sacred words of Malacath. I fear the words are in terrible danger.",""
"200879108-0-42636","Really! Then may Malacath bless you and keep you safe. Thank you, friend!",""
"200879108-0-42637","She ….nnThat foolish girl! We're a traditional clan. Shatul will never accept an exiled woman as chief!",""
"200879108-0-42638","I understand. Not everyone cares to keep the old traditions alive, not with all this talk of Trinimac and the future.nnWell, good luck to you, any way.",""
"200879108-0-42640","There's a path to the moot through the temple? The old tunnels. Of course! That must be what you're talking about.nnHere, take this key. It opens the temple library. If there really are old tunnels, the way to access them is probably in there.",""
"200879108-0-42642","Yes, indeed! Wait a moment. It was you, wasn't it? I'd recognize you anywhere! Were you actually able to recover the sacred words?",""
"200879108-0-42643","Just look around! Have you ever seen so many severed heads in one place? It's enough to make an executioner blush. But like I always say, one mer's obsession is another mer's gain. If they want a filthy old werewolf pelt, I'll see that they get it.",""
"200879108-0-42644","How exciting! You must tell me all about it! I hope that one day I can gaze upon the sacred words and gain the wisdom of Malacath.",""
"200879108-0-42645","Good for you! I can't wait to hear all about it. I hope that one day I can read the sacred words of Malacath myself and gain his wisdom.",""
"200879108-0-42646","I know, I had the same idea. But I asked a priest of Malacath who assured me—ogre innards were commonly found in ancient Orc dishes.nnDoes this mean the Daedric Prince of Vengeance favors pies? I forgot to ask the priest.",""
"200879108-0-42647","Say what you want about tradition … I think Orcs first turned a <<z:1>> into food because it looks amazing.nnAll the rest is hot smoke up the flue. ""The preferred meal of <<2>> himself."" If you believe the Orsinium vendors—which you shouldn't.",""
"200879108-0-42648","<<Cmz:1>> are delicacies fit for a chief. Look near the old aqueduct, in areas without snow.nn<<Cz:2>> is spread around when durzog migrate—it's where they were, not where they are. The seeds catch in their paws, or something.",""
"200879108-0-42653","It must be a reaction to the <<z:1>>. I assure you, I cleaned them thoroughly before ….nnNo, it's the <<z:2>>! I should have broiled before baking. Try running your tongue across your teeth—back and forth, as fast as you can.",""
"200879108-0-42655","It's better you swallowed the tooth whole than tried to chew it. Though … you might pay for it later.nnI was worried about the presentation—removing all the teeth makes the stew bowl look sickly.",""
"200879108-0-42656","What a ridiculous notion! Trinimac promotes unity and civilization, not anarchy and violence like those Vosh Rakh fanatics claim.nnDare I ask? Tell me, who do we have to thank for this terrible situation?",""
"200879108-0-42657","Ah, the work of an egg merchant is never done. The tastes of Orsinium have become much more refined, you see. I used to be able to make a living on goose eggs alone. Now I've got orders for kwama, and chub loon, and even spider eggs!",""
"200879108-0-42658","There's a path to the moot through the temple? Perhaps via the old tunnels? Yes, that must be the way!nnHere, take this key. It opens the library. If there really are old tunnels under the temple, the way to access them is probably in there.",""
"200879108-0-42659","Indeed I do. I make the best of it though. Where there are eggs, there are also women.nnI've got to say though, these Orc ladies are a bit chilly. Must be the diet. Nothing but meat and turnips would turn even Dibella sour, am I right?",""
"200879108-0-42660","Yes. Eggs, I mean. They laid eggs.",""
"200879108-0-42661","Oh no, never mind that. Our mutual friend Deechee told me that none of the eggs were ever viable. Thank goodness, eh? That's an ethical debate I'd just as soon avoid.",""
"200879108-0-42662","Comfortable? No! It's an abomination. But it's not for me to judge. Somewhere out there, there's a customer who's desperate to consume a magical person-egg. Who am I to deny them that opportunity?",""
"200879108-0-42663","I've heard about the tunnels under the city. Kurog left the ancient pathways in place and just built the new structures on top.nnI suppose if the passage is clear, we can reach the moot using that route.",""
"200879108-0-42664","Then let's go investigate the library! We'll turn over every floor board and bookcase until we find something.",""
"200879108-0-42665","Then we take the fight to Kurog and Alga. If they refuse to yield, then we fight on until either they or us can fight no more!nnKurog's reign ends today! So swears Bazrag of Clan Fharun! So swears Bazrag of the Orsimer!",""
"200879108-0-42666","I understand. Even a snow bear pauses to consider the elk before delivering the killing blow.nnJust remember what Kurog plans to do to the clan chiefs, to our friends. Even to you. Time is running out, so don't take too long to make up your mind.",""
"200879108-0-42667","This isn't going to be like drinking mead with the Nords. We're talking about defying the king! At best, we'll be branded as king-slayers. At worst, we'll be dead.nnThis isn't your fight. Not really. Are you still ready to go through with this?",""
"200879108-0-42668","Mostly deers and bears. Sometimes I'll even go after echateres, but they're usually more trouble than they're worth.",""
"200879108-0-42669","That's what I thought—so I hunted down a cultist of Namira. After a series of beatings, he confirmed the Lady of Decay would strike him with five kinds of pox if he offered up a slice of ventricle pie.nnTwo Daedric Princes agree—not cannibalism.",""
"200879108-0-42670","Did Solgra know about the tunnels beneath the temple? Was she able to tell you how we can reach the moot before more people die?",""
"200879108-0-42671","Of course. Even a snow bear pauses to consider the elk before delivering the killing blow.nnJust remember what Kurog plans to do to the clan chiefs, to our friends. Even to you. Time isn't on our side, so don't take too long to make up your mind.",""
"200879108-0-42672","This isn't going to be like swimming in mud with the Argonians. We're talking about defying the king! At best, we'll be branded as king-slayers. At worst, we'll be dead.nnThis isn't your fight. Not really. Are you still ready to go through with this?",""
"200879108-0-42674","We're building atop the ruins of the previous Orsinium that occupied this same spot. There was an older city, but that's located some distance from here.nnThe Bretons occupied the place most recently, and they did keep it in good repair.",""
"200879108-0-42675","Major infrastructure work is nearing completion, and the return of the supplies stolen by the Winterborn has really made a difference to our efforts.nnWe'd be a bit further along if we hadn't stopped to celebrate when we heard the Ice-Heart was dead.",""
"200879108-0-42677","Echateres? Are you sure? What am I saying, of course you're sure. There's no way to confuse an echatere with a mammoth.nnMaybe I'll just keep hunting. The last time I tried to catch an echatere, I found out it was hunting me.",""
"200879108-0-42678","Really? I love venison! But you need to sneak up on those critters carefully. I got kicked right in the tusk by a deer once. Hurt like you wouldn't believe.",""
"200879108-0-42680","I think so. It happened so fast.nnSpeaking of which, did you see what happened?",""
"200879108-0-42681","Yes, the final touches are being added even as we speak. Repairs to the market stalls and main gates will make Orsinium a shining example of what a city should be.nnI just wish the king were still alive to see his dream come to fruition.",""
"200879108-0-42683","Probably a good thing you weren't around when it happened. Probably would have gotten injured, just like me.nnWell, thanks for checking on me. I'll be all right.",""
"200879108-0-42684","Is that what that thing was? It certainly scared the tartar off my tusks, I'll tell you!nnWell, I was able to get out of the way before any serious harm was done. Thanks for checking on me. I'll be all right.",""
"200879108-0-42685","I guess you could say that. I got here before the soldiers arrived, if that's what you mean.nnHad just enough time to warn the chief and then all of Oblivion broke lose. But we handled it. We handled it real good!",""
"200879108-0-42686","They will go to The Ashen Forge, of course, to be honed and tempered—made whole in the cleansing fires of Malacath.",""
"200879108-0-42687","What? Of course it is. Every Orc, deep in their heart, yearns to be thrust into Malacath's coals. To see their grudges and fury folded and hardened on the Anvil of Ash!",""
"200879108-0-42688","It is difficult for outsiders to grasp. The Orc faith … the true Orc faith, offers few comforts, but ample glory. Those spirits you liberate will be glad to enter Malacath's realm, I assure you.",""
"200879108-0-42689","Trinimac? Don't tell me you're one of those misguided Elf-worshippers. No, we don't have a seat at the Elf-gods' table. Don't want one either.nnYou seem like a good Orc. You've got a strong heart. Don't be taken in by those charlatans.",""
"200879108-0-42690","I am glad to hear you say that. Too many of our brethren have strayed from the Code—taken in by those blasphemers in Orsinium. It does my heart good to know that Thukhozod's slaves will be freed by an Orc such as you.",""
"200879108-0-42691","It's like a <<z:1>>, but tastier. Only grows in these parts.",""
"200879108-0-42692","Only an Orc can become chief of Shatul. Or of any Orc clan. It's … I can't say it any simpler than that.",""
"200879108-0-42693","You? But … no Orc woman has ever led Shatul. Or any Orc clan.nnThere's no possibility. Such a radical idea would drive the clan apart.",""
"200879108-0-42694","The real <<1>> has a squeak in his voice. One day he paid Morkul's forge-wife to make him sound ""like an ogre."" He always wore the helmet, everywhere he went.nnIt still smells like sweaty breeches and onions. I cleaned it three times. Nothing worked.",""
"200879108-0-42695","Some won't. They may challenge me, and I'll have to kill them.nnBut when any other clan clucks about the Code of Malacath, Shatul will band together, as we always do. We'll triple their rate on echatere—a built in blood price for the disrespect.",""
"200879108-0-42696","I think we'll get rich off the Malacath zealots. That will make the king happy.nnAnd if he asks me to be his chief-wife, I'll decline. But I'll offer him the chance to be my king-husband.",""
"200879108-0-42697","<<1>>'s heart was never in the match. But refusing would've led to a feud.nnFather was insufferable. ""A chief's daughter must bear the clan's burdens."" But children are a burden I don't ever plan to bear—not for the clan, not for anyone.",""
"200879108-0-42698","I … I haven't thought about that in years. He was always Uncle <<1>> to me. Taught me how to play Chop … always called me ""little one,"" even when I was nearly his height.nnI looked up to him. Then father insisted I become his hunt-wife.",""
"200879108-0-42700","Look everywhere! It'll probably be something odd or out of place, like those switches over there.nnBut this is a library. Maybe one of these dusty old tomes can help. There's bound to be a book that talks about the construction of the temple in here.",""
"200879108-0-42701","Gladly.",""
"200879108-0-42702","Good, good. Although, there is a problem. Neither contender is good for Shatul.nn<<1>> has weakness in his heart. <<2>> is weak of mind. Something must be done.",""
"200879108-0-42703","You spent time with both contenders. Perhaps you see a strength in one that I do not.nnI must prepare the clan for its new chief. As I do so, I ask that you help Shatul survive.",""
"200879108-0-42704","Take this ritual blade. It has a subtle flaw at its core, just like <<1>> and <<2>>. Replace the blade of the contender you judge to be weakest.nnIf the blade fails, yet the contender bests his opponent, he proves himself worthy of leading Shatul.",""
"200879108-0-42706","Then he dies.nnGo, quickly. You must reach the Bloody Knoll before <<1>> and <<2>> reach the dueling chamber.",""
"200879108-0-42707","There is a separate entrance to the Bloody Knoll, away from the sacred chambers. I want you to go there and fix the duel before it starts.",""
"200879108-0-42708","Fair? I just watched my son die. None of this is fair!nnThe flawed blade is a test. A weak contender who survives despite this setback deserves to become chief of Shatul.",""
"200879108-0-42709","When the blade fails, the weakest contender will most assuredly die. If they … if she ….nnGo, there is little time. Malacath favor the victor.",""
"200879108-0-42710","I don't know … poison, ritual sacrifice, time when she slipped away from the clan. Anything that connects her to Boethiah.",""
"200879108-0-42712","Ah yes, the cleansing totem. It appears to be nothing more than a wooden charm, I know. But rest assured, it is imbued with tremendous power.nnAnd once its power is expended, it makes a lovely accent to any table centerpiece!",""
"200879108-0-42713","No, no. It's just a simple matter of holding it above the corruption and concentrating.nnIt's vital that you concentrate on cleansing the corruption, though. If you're daydreaming about puppies, it will probably just make a weird sound.",""
"200879108-0-42715","Yeah? How did you know?",""
"200879108-0-42717","No, walker. The pain is still too near. This one needs more drink …. Yes, another drink and I will tell you my tale.",""
"200879108-0-42718","It is true, you are the chief. But you had no right to go through my things.nnIt's a book of battle poetry. It was a gift from <<1>>.",""
"200879108-0-42719","Oh, that. I wasn't singing, I was chanting. I was out hunting when I nearly stumbled into a mammoth.nnThey have poor night vision. If you chant the way the giants do, sometimes you can fool them into thinking you're not a threat.",""
"200879108-0-42720","We're a clan that travels the range. It gets boring at night. Sometimes we sing to keep up our spirits.",""
"200879108-0-42721","Then leave me be. I need to figure out my future in this clan.nnOr if I have a future.",""
"200879108-0-42722","Well, I don't! What is the point of your questions?",""
"200879108-0-42723","Well … I don't know why he would. But you're right, his own blade was still in the tent.nnThat means nothing. She's still a Boethiah cultist, I'm sure of it.",""
"200879108-0-42724","What does <<1>> care about Orsinium politics? The book proves her guilt!nnWhat about <<2>>? He heard something the night before my husband was struck down.",""
"200879108-0-42725","We've all seen her do that before—of course she would say that! Followers of Boethiah live only to deceive. It was Boethiah worship, no matter what she says.nn<<1>> deserves justice. Something must be done about <<2>>!",""
"200879108-0-42726","I've accepted our roles, if that's what you mean. With the crown comes new responsibilities, new duties. First and foremost, my husband needs an heir, and I'm going to make sure he gets one.nnIf he thinks being the king is difficult, just you wait!",""
"200879108-0-42727","Galvin still agonizes over every job we accept, making sure it hits his high code of honor.nnAs for the Remly brothers, they're as useless as ever. You should have seen their last invention. Almost took out my eye!",""
"200879108-0-42729","I have a couple of ideas. Not ready to share them yet, but I won't stop until I find him in some brothel in Abah's Landing or at a tavern in Murkmire.",""
"200879108-0-42730","I survived battles with the Winterborn. Helped take down a tyrant king and a horrible cult. And here I am, drinking and talking to you.nnI think that's somewhat impressive, if I do say so myself. Perhaps I'll finally get the respect I deserve.",""
"200879108-0-42731","Indeed it is. Though, I am far away, at the very edge of the world.",""
"200879108-0-42732","So you did. And I have gone on to the next great adventure.",""
"200879108-0-42733","I bring you a warning, Champion. Oblivion stirs. Great and terrible machinations have begun. Once again, Tamriel is in danger. You have a part to play in the events to come.",""
"200879108-0-42734","A great war is coming. A war between the forces of Oblivion. The Daedric Princes are choosing sides. The great deceiver, the sewer of discord, and the patron of darkness plot a great deception.",""
"200879108-0-42735","Be ready. Watch for signs. The war shall begin when the gates of Sotha Sil's lost city are re-opened. So the scrolls portend. So shall it be.",""
"200879108-0-42737","I cannot aid you in the coming battle. My time in this world is at an end. I must take my place in the Immortal Plane. Farewell, old friend. We will not speak again.",""
"200879108-0-42738","King Bazrag informed me that he plans to return the temple to its original purpose as a shrine to Malacath. I'm not sure what that mean for the Trinimac priesthood, but he has requested that I serve as a royal advisor.",""
"200879108-0-42740","I … I  have something I want to try first. Something that will help repay the Orcs for my … indiscretion.",""
"200879108-0-42741","Upset? No. Disappointed? Most definitely.nnI can't dispute the fact that Trinimac fanatics caused so much trouble. If returning the city to Malacath makes up for that, who am I to argue?",""
"200879108-0-42742","I'm a priest of Trinimac and I always will be, whether we have a temple of our own or not.nnThese people, they've become my family. I'll stay and help the new king for as long as he needs me. And if I happen to give a few sermons, who can blame me?",""
"200879108-0-42743","I'm going to miss you, my friend. I truly believe that Trinimac sent you to us when we needed you most.nnI wish you well. If you ever have need of me, I'll do my best to be at your side.",""
"200879108-0-42745","Orcs usually burn the bodies of chiefs and heroes. Mix the ashes into swords and shields.nnBut for Kurog? I think I'll have the seat of the throne recast. That way, he'll always be a pain in my arse. Help remind me what I should and shouldn't do.",""
"200879108-0-42746","Never wanted to be a king. Still don't, really. But this is the best way to keep the clans from fighting or starving to death once winter sets in.nnI'll wear the crown for as long as I have to. Set my people on the right path.",""
"200879108-0-42747","Good! I knew you would.nnI wish you safe travels. I'll try not to get too jealous while I'm stuck here being a royal bureaucrat and you're out there being a hero.",""
"200879108-0-42748","Orcs have no concept of goodbye. We just come and go as we please.nnBut you're always welcome in Orsinium, my friend. I'll be here, cleaning up the mess that Kurog left us with. Just try not to get killed without me, all right?",""
"200879108-0-42749","What's wrong with me? Just look! My guts are busted all to pieces. See how swollen my ankle is? I'm on death's doorstep here and no one cares!",""
"200879108-0-42750","Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were a master healer. Everyone knows that when your guts get beaten up, the juices gather down in your ankles. Don't play dumb.",""
"200879108-0-42751","An avalanche? Try six avalanches!nnThat mountain is cursed. There's something wrong with it, and I don't have any interest in finding out what it is. I just need to go back home, see a healer about my, you know, my injuries, and that's that.",""
"200879108-0-42752","Look, you can't tell me how to feel. I get enough of that from Stughrush. You weren't there. All that snow and ice crashing down on us. We should all be dead as drunk mice on a Morndas. It's damn near a miracle any of us survived.",""
"200879108-0-42753","Yeah, I'm fit as a sodding fiddle. Can't you tell? nnBah. 'Course I'm not all right. That damn mountain beat the piss out of us.",""
"200879108-0-42754","I am! Or rather, this one has apprenticed to the kind merchant. nnI decided, after talking to Avreg and the hearth-mother, that it would be good for me to get some broader experience. And you know what? I like the hustle and bustle of the city.",""
"200879108-0-42755","Avalanche. We'd already lost a few of these grunts before we reached the second marker—damn near froze solid. By the third marker we were at half strength. And just before the fourth, that's when things really went south.",""
"200879108-0-42756","Arrgh. Not your fault. Something about this mountain—like it's possessed. Doesn't want us up there.nnBut to Oblivion with that! If I want to climb a damn mountain, I'm gonna climb it! No pile of rocks is going to tell me what to do.",""
"200879108-0-42757","They are well. Avreg will come and visit me soon.nnOrgotha told the elders all the details of the Riekr raiders and how she handled the problems, and they told her she did well for someone with her experience. She also told them how you helped us.",""
"200879108-0-42758","It's very interesting. I meet different people every day. And I like learning a trade.nnI even met another Khajiit. She's an enchanter. And enchanting. I make excuses to stop by her shop sometimes. I like to listen to her talk.",""
"200879108-0-42759","Maybe. I don't know.nnWrothgar's the only home I've ever known, and my clan is my family. But I think I'd like to see the Khajiit homeland some day. To see people that look like me everywhere I turn.",""
"200879108-0-42760","He's wonderful. He likes city living, though I think he's getting fat. He sleeps by the fire most of the day and lets everyone fuss over him. He also keeps the mice and rats away from the stored goods, so he earns his keep as much as I do.",""
"200879108-0-42761","It was a mess. Snow, hail, wind, ice … I thought the whole damn mountain was gonna fall over. Got hit five or six times before we tucked tail.nnCracked some ribs. Collar bone, too. But that won't keep me down. I'll beat this mountain yet.",""
"200879108-0-42762","Not that well, all things considered. When I saw the high priestess's body, just lying on that slab ….nnLook, I've got to get out of here. If I stick around, these feelings, these memories, they're never going to fade.",""
"200879108-0-42763","I'm better. Much, actually.nnHey, I wanted to tell you that I forgive you. For Talviah. Not that you asked, mind you. I don't know what happened in there, but I know you save people. Solgra, me. If Talviah had to die, I know you had no a choice.",""
"200879108-0-42764","Orsinium! The museum? You … have heard of it, haven't you?nnYou simply must go, the next time you're in the city! It's the perfect place to reveal ogre artwork to all of Tamriel.",""
"200879108-0-42765","The braziers by the statues must be lit in a certain order. I tried every combination—none of it worked.nnI can see it now, adorned on my cairn … ""Here fell <<1>>. Kept from Morkuldin because of some stupid puzzle.""",""
"200879108-0-42766","There's an ogre outcast who's said to eats nuts, berries, and vegetables—never meat. It's like the opposite of a Valenwood Bosmer.nnThink how tender his organs must be … mmm!",""
"200879108-0-42767","Location, really. Also, <<mz:1>> have a very distinct flavor. While delicious, they would overpower the dish.nnOn its own, the <<z:2>> is far more subtle, but it is perfect for bringing other tastes to the forefront.",""
"200879108-0-42768","Yeah. He wanted me to stay and help train the Orc archers. Even offered me my own squad and a fancy title.nnBut after everything that happened, I just need to get away so I can put this all behind me.",""
"200879108-0-42769","I'm not sure. I might return to Valenwood, see my family. I'm kind of missing my loved ones after what we've been through.nnI wonder if Solgra had a family. She … never mentioned it.",""
"200879108-0-42770","There's so much I want to tell you. To thank you for. I've learned so much from you. Out of everyone here, you're the one person I never lost faith in.nnI wish I could just go and follow you around forever.",""
"200879108-0-42772","You mean the arrow in the chest? I'm still sore. But I can move around on my own. Solgra says I need lots of rest, but that can wait. I'm not going to miss a chance to say goodbye to everyone. Especially you.nnPlus, I have an amazing scar now!",""
"200879108-0-42773","No idea. Not even sure what an archery unit does, other than loose arrows at things. I get to be a captain, though! Investigator Vale doesn't even have her own squad! Well, except in that one book, but you remember what happened to them.",""
"200879108-0-42774","I'd give you a huge hug right now if I wasn't so sore.nnI don't suppose you'd be willing to stick around? Stay with us for a while? I'm still not sure what's going to happen once you disappear. It's going to take some getting used to.",""
"200879108-0-42775","Figured you say that. Maybe I'll track you down one day and we can get into some more trouble together.nnI'm going to miss you. Just be safe out there, all right? I'll be around if you ever need me.",""
"200879108-0-42776","Go away!",""
"200879108-0-42777","Not. Funny.",""

"200879108-0-42790","I serve my <<1>>, as you serve <<2>>.nnBut … you don't exactly serve him, do you? Arakaul, wasn't it?",""
"200879108-0-42791","I've noticed. You insult one another, then laugh about it. The Savage Sons allow him to lead, is that it?nnIt's not the sort of honor I know, but … I can see how he earned your respect.",""
"200879108-0-42792","What? No! Mercedene's troops were to blame for ….nnI cannot speak for <<1>>, or my king. But for myself … this siege should have ended years ago. It pleases none but the crows.",""
"200879108-0-42793","Because I serve a lord and obey his commands. Because my lord serves a king, and obeys his commands. It is the way of things, where I'm from.nnI've said too much. Thank you for the food. It is an unexpected kindness.",""

"200879108-0-42812","I saw it when the sun was setting, so I'd say you'd want to fish for it at night. And with a fish that big, you'd want a couple friends helping out. How else would you manage to reel it in?",""
"200879108-0-42813","Your reasons don't matter. You spared me the knowledge of my grand-daughter's deception. You took a terrible choice upon yourself—bore it like a true Shatul Orc.",""

"200879108-0-42821","I sent a caravan full of food and supplies to Orsinium. Once there, everything will be distributed to the outlying clans to help them make it through the winter.nnThe caravan's slow. I want you to catch up with it and see it safely to the city.",""

"200879108-0-42838","Good, good. You likely have many questions, but first comes my proposal. You have shown you can take a life, easily and without pause. But to join our family, to join the Dark Brotherhood, you must show you can not only kill, but obey.",""
"200879108-0-42839","Oh, aren't you? What then, self-defense? Necessity? Or they deserved to die? Justice, was it? For each and every one?nnThe reason matters not. All souls belong to Sithis in the Void. We are but the instruments of their delivery.",""
"200879108-0-42840","Naturally, and there will be a time for answers. First, my proposal. You have shown you can take a life, easily and without pause. But to join our family, to join the Dark Brotherhood, you must show you can not only kill, but obey.",""
"200879108-0-42843","Ah, silence. The sweet music of Sithis. You'll serve us well. But before that, a task. You have shown you can take a life, easily and without pause. But to join our family, to join the Dark Brotherhood, you must show you can not only kill, but obey.",""
"200879108-0-42846","You are wise to ask for aid when needed. Never hesitate to rely on your brothers and sisters once you are part of our family. Oftentimes their insight can be a great boon.nnFirst, tell me: what do you expect to see when you reach Varo's estate?",""
"200879108-0-42847","As with any job, you should be well supplied. You will certainly need lockpicks regardless of the route you choose to take. Quintus Varo is not a man to leave his doors unsecured.",""
"200879108-0-42848","High walls. Barred gates. Patrolling manor guards. Taking a life is easy. Reaching your mark is often the true task.nnBeneath the storeroom of the Withered Rose is a series of tunnels that can get you under Varo's walls without being seen.",""
"200879108-0-42849","Most would say we are mere killers. Merciless, remorseless … mad. But we are more than that. We are first and foremost a family, bound by blood and death and the embrace of our dear Night Mother. Killing is simply our trade, and our worship.",""
"200879108-0-42850","The Night Mother. Others may bear the title, but our Unholy Matron is unique and above all. The true Mother, and the one true Bride of Sithis. We are her children, wrapped in her cold and loving embrace.",""
"200879108-0-42851","To put it simply, yes. We take the lives of innocent or guilty alike, sending their souls to Sithis. As long as the price is paid. Death is our craft. The family business, if you will. It can be quite lucrative, in more ways than one.",""

"200879108-0-42853","Let's just say Ponticus handles things differently than most bishops of Akatosh. And by differently, I mean violently.nnNormally heretics are shunned, chastised, maybe fined. Ponticus secretly has them beheaded.",""
"200879108-0-42854","Why would it, my dear? The bishop's henchmen are trained to handle beggars and cripples, not warriors. If they try to behead you, you behead them right back!nnBut first, let's ensure Andrya sees a priest give the order. She'll know that's not right.",""
"200879108-0-42855","Long story short, a man came between us. And not in that revolting 'Oh, he's so handsome and dashing' sense. In the sense that he tried to kill my little sister, and I killed him instead.",""
"200879108-0-42856","She loved him, I think. She couldn't see what he was, even up until the end. He was going to kill us both, but she was certain she could talk him out of it.nnI didn't give either of them that chance.",""
"200879108-0-42857","We'll start with his predecessor. The old High Priest of Akatosh died just when it was convenient for Ponticus to ascend.nnAn unexpected death, supposedly natural, but the timing couldn't have been better. And then there's the beheadings.",""
"200879108-0-42858","Some entrenched clergy disliked Ponticus, resisted his claim after the old high priest passed. One by one, people found them outside town without their heads.nnPonticus claims it was the Red Sails, but honestly, would you believe him?",""
"200879108-0-42859","What? You wouldn't be accusing me of dealing in stolen goods? I would never do that!nnAnd I certainly wouldn't inform on those who did. My reputation is worth more to me than, well, it's worth quite a lot.",""
"200879108-0-42860","Why, that is the exact amount!nnI have heard of a merchant very interested in … dispossessed relics. Her name is Veronique Rirniel, and she even has a list of those items she's already acquired!nnI just happen to have a copy of this list. Here.",""
"200879108-0-42861","I've heard that before. When you change your mind, I'll be here.nnEverything has a price.",""
"200879108-0-42867","You're the problem, outsider. Preaching that filth about Boethiah to our righteous faithful! These good people won't stand for it, and neither will I.nnYou're coming with me to the courtyard of judgment, alive or dead.",""
"200879108-0-42869","Well … that's right, I am. Now march!nnIf you're lucky, the bishop's justice will simply fine you for the row your caused. If you resist or cause further trouble, I can't guarantee your safety.",""

"200879108-0-42874","Iron Wheel cipher keys. A lucky find. We lifted documents a few days ago, but they're in code. Sorry for this poor bastard, but I need to crack those documents quickly. nnI need you to get to Velsa. Be careful, she booby trapped this place.",""
"200879108-0-42876","Because she's Velsa, that's why. Velsa is not the most… sociable of people. She is smart, knows a lot about sabotage and alchemy. She is very private. nnNo one really knows where she came from, or why she joined up with the Guild years ago.",""
"200879108-0-42878","Welcome home.",""
"200879108-0-42879","We can't track her. She knows how to hide a trail, but her faith makes her predictable.nnThere's some old shrines to Akatosh along Varen's Wall. I'll bet she's feeling penitent. We'll split up and search. If you find her, politely ask her to wait.",""
"200879108-0-42881","The captain keeps a manifest in her cabin. Has all her contacts and sales information there.nnYou can also spy on <<1>>. I think she does most of the dirty dealing herself. She's usually down by the ship, talking to her ""clients.""",""

"200879108-0-42886","Good! If you want to find out what's happening, you've got two choices.nnYou could try to spy on the Overseer, the Yard Boss's main crony. She meets with unsavory characters on the west dock. Hide out there and maybe you'll hear something useful.",""
"200879108-0-42887","The crazy look in your eyes? The nonsense you were spouting about Boethiah? Isn't killing what a disciple of the warrior prince does?",""

"200879108-0-42896","Oh, you wouldn't be interested in this old woman's tale, dear. Suffice to say I put my old life behind me when I joined the Dark Brotherhood. I dedicated myself to my new family, to the Night Mother, and never looked back.",""
"200879108-0-42897","It's best to put our former lives behind us, no matter what they were. This is my home now, and yours as well. We serve Sithis, we serve the Night Mother, we serve our family. nnLet's … change the subject.",""

"200879108-0-42902","Ah, ambitious are we, dear? Good. The simplest way is to complete contracts. Every life you send to Sithis pleases the Night Mother, and raises your station with the Brotherhood. Perform enough jobs and do them well, and you'll be promoted.",""

"200879108-0-42934","What you mean is Danni suspects I might have had a hand in that botched dowry heist. Don't look so shocked. I may not be active in the guild but that doesn't mean I don't hear things. nnI'm retired. I don't owe Danni anything.",""
"200879108-0-42936","Is today ""ask Velsa for favors day""?nnBah! I see that look in your eye, Silver Claws. Very well, n'wah. You help me do a favor for this ruffled ball of fur here and I will go and speak with Danni. Just so she can apologize for suspecting me.",""
"200879108-0-42937","Well, paying me wouldn't hurt.nnSeriously, for enough cash, even I can be brave! Or, I can give you a little free information. I happen to know a particularly odious individual who has just the outfit you need. Which will it be?",""
"200879108-0-42938","Sorry, you just don't have anywhere to put it. Clear out your inventory!",""
"200879108-0-42939","And here's your costume! I've been making these foul, lifeless things for the Violet Lamp ever since they came to town. Nice to provide one to someone who'll do something creative with it.nnNow, get out of here before someone sees us together.",""
"200879108-0-42940","Well, there is another way. There's a loathsome individual I just sold one of these costumes to. He actually likes working for the Violet Lamp.nnI suppose if you stole it from him, that'd be fine. Here's his address, unless you'd rather buy one?",""
"200879108-0-42941","You see this division of tasks as, perhaps, lopsided? Do not. Jimila pulls her weight.nnThis one will ensure Dockmaster Qamar remains here, arguing with Jimila … not checking his stash. Thus ensuring none disturb your search. Elegant, yes?",""
"200879108-0-42942","To take on a cargo of silks and rare spices that will fetch a grand price in Vulkhel Guard. A simple journey, had these Red Sails not imposed.nnAnvil is no longer a profitable port. When ships stop arriving, perhaps this pirate queen will understand.",""
"200879108-0-42943","The Prowler has sailed many seas, walker, yet this one has met no pirate, scoundrel, or privateer that can best Captain Jimila in a drinking contest.nnThe latest defeated foe mumbled of the stash while in his cups. A wonderful fool.",""
"200879108-0-42944","Her given name is Arethusa ap Dugal, and she claims the title of Anvil's Provincial Governor. Those not blinded by her beauty know her as the Red Sail pirate queen.nnHer Red Sails make no move without her blessing. Pah! They are a scourge upon Anvil.",""
"200879108-0-42945","Ha ha ha, the pair on you! Listen to this one, boys! I'd slit your throat if I wasn't laughing so hard.nnNobody touches Qamar's stash but Qamar. Now make yourself scarce before I crack your skull.",""
"200879108-0-42946","Silver Claws needs a message sent. And to get a rather important ledger out of its hiding place. nnThere is a warehouse on the south end of the docks. Meet me near the far wall, out of sight. You can use the trapdoor in my house to get out safely.",""
"200879108-0-42949","Ha! Qamar's never covered anything, and I've run his deposits many a night. Fat sack has no loyalty or appreciation for talent.nnYou've kept me in the game, friend. If you're looking for adventure, why not try the cave outside Anvil?",""
"200879108-0-42950","Ha ha ha! No more! I'll die from laughter long before you take my head!nnYou're a salty breeze, friend, and Qamar's not worth my trouble. You want his stash? Head into the cave outside Anvil and take it yourself.",""
"200879108-0-42951","That conniving one, Iszreena needs a lesson. This one worked out of that warehouse for years. All knew it. But she bribed and lied and Silver Claws ends up out of his warehouse.nnMy office holds an important ledger. She must not get her claws on it.",""
"200879108-0-42952","The ledger holds information on contacts, secrets, who owes me money. Many things. I kept it hidden in a closet in my office Iit must be retrieved! nnIf Iszreena's goods are damaged or destroyed in the process, this one will not be displeased.",""
"200879108-0-42954","This one listens. Some chafe at the careful balance of trade, theft, barter and shaded dealings that the Guild has helped manage for many years. nnWith the loss of Nicholas, it seems that someone wants to change the game.",""
"200879108-0-42955","In Hew's Bane one can profit, if one understands the game. The Guild manages the merchants, traders, troublemakers. nnNow rumors are saying that the Thieves Guild want all for themselves. I know it is not true. But others? They are not sure.",""
"200879108-0-42958","The unclawed understand only fear and anger. Qamar saw what he expected while blind to everything else. Even Rajhin would appreciate his fleecing!nnThat fool's extra coin has almost made this trip worth the trouble.",""
"200879108-0-42960","Grew up a smith's apprentice. Loved the trade, but my master was a right bastard. One day I killed him for it.",""
"200879108-0-42961","Nah. That was a lifetime ago. Had to go on the run after, but I was too young and too stupid. Ended up in the Sentinel dungeons for my crime. Spent sixteen years there, actually.",""
"200879108-0-42962","Had to figure out how to make my way after I got free. The mark on my face branded me a killer, figured I might as well be one. Ended up working as a … messenger for a while. Not long after that, I had a visit from the Dark Brotherhood.",""
"200879108-0-42963","Met some people there. Picked up on a lot of things. How to be smart as well as strong. When one of the gaolers let his guard down, I was ready. Simple as that.nn'Course I had no real life to go back to. But I was free.",""
"200879108-0-42964","I found my calling here. They taught me that the feelings I had, that drive to kill, was the Dread Father working through me. They gave me a home, a way to earn a living, and a set of rules to live by. Life makes sense with the Brotherhood.",""
"200879108-0-42965","Take a walk, Elf-lover, and I maybe I won't kill you.",""
"200879108-0-42967","I erect the spine of surrender! I do not know Qamar, nor do I know of this stash. Please, I simply wish a friendly game of dice.",""
"200879108-0-42969","Then get in there! The Lamp didn't hire us to stand around and talk … and they take a dim view of idlers.nnMy recommendation is, give them a wide berth, and don't even go near that central tower! That's the entrance to Old Hiradirge.",""
"200879108-0-42970","Ha! You're kidding! Only people who go inside there go in kicking and screaming … unless they're Violet Lamp officers!nnSomebody was pulling your leg, friend. Stay out of there.",""
"200879108-0-42971","Okay, okay! It was so strange, I wrote it down. Take it!nn""Darkness covers the world.""",""
"200879108-0-42972","That's more than I make in a week. Well, it was a really strange phrase, so I wrote it down:nn""Darkness covers the world.""nnDon't get killed, okay?",""
"200879108-0-42973","You'd need to know the pass-phrase, and no one knows the whole thing but the Lamp officers … and I wouldn't got asking them.nnStill, I did hear one of them talking about it, once. But it's only one part. You'd need all three.",""
"200879108-0-42974","The Five Tenets. I'll leave it to Elam to drill you on those if he hasn't already. As long as we keep to those, our family will protect and provide for us.",""
"200879108-0-42975","It is what people do. You can call me Green-Venom-Tongue. Everyone else does.",""
"200879108-0-42976","A complicated question for an Argonian. But I take your meaning.nnPut in simple terms, my life begins and ends with the Dark Brotherhood. I am a Shadowscale.",""
"200879108-0-42978","I neither like nor dislike it. It simply is. I serve Viera as I served my former sanctuary. I serve the needs of Black Marsh when they call on me. And when I am not needed, I read.",""
"200879108-0-42979","Argonians born under the sign of the Shadow are given over to the Dark Brotherhood, trained as assassins from the day they hatch.nnIt means I'm very, very good at killing.",""
"200879108-0-42980","Of course! It's important to get to know everyone. You're part of the family now. We've got your back, and we hope you have ours.",""
"200879108-0-42981","Oh, that's little Hilde. You'll have to, uh, save your introduction to her for later. She's a sweet one, but never learned to control her transformations.",""
"200879108-0-42982","I'll do better than that. It was so strange, I wrote it down.nn""Darkness covers the world.""",""

"200879108-0-42986","Oh? Very forward. I like that. But I won't just spill my guts on demand, here and now. Can't you take me someplace nice?",""
"200879108-0-42987","We serve the Night Mother. the Bride of Sithis, our Unholy Matron. It is her embrace that binds us together as family. You must never dishonor her, and understand that your contracts are more than just tasks. You carry out her will.",""
"200879108-0-42988","Yes, Poor lad. Quite young, but charming enough in his own way. A fellow Breton, too. I believe he said his name was Van.",""
"200879108-0-42989","I'm only teasing you, darling. nnI suppose most people would say my defining attribute is my family name. The Motierres are very powerful, by means of being very rich. Of course, I left that life behind.",""
"200879108-0-42990","Boredom, mostly. Growing up with servants and handmaids and everything you could want already in front of you might sound well and good, but it's dreadfully dull. nnUntil I strangled my handmaid with a golden chain, that is. That was interesting.",""
"200879108-0-42991","Our Mother hears the prayer, and shares her will with the Listener. The Listener sends a Speaker to arrange the details that become a contract, and then the Speaker will carry it down to us, the assassins. nnSo remember, this is more than just a job.",""
"200879108-0-42992","""Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.""nnThese words, along with the proper ritual, form the Black Sacrament. The means by which those in need pray to the Night Mother.",""

"200879108-0-42994","He was killed on the job. It happens from time to time, but this one seems to be vexing Viera even more than usual. She's always been the motherly sort, but she barely even got a chance to know this boy.",""
"200879108-0-42995","You don't hunt the Dark Brotherhood. We hunt you. Anyone targeting us would only be sealing their own fate.",""
"200879108-0-42998","Good. That rude woman should not benefit from stealing my goods, taking over my warehouse.nnI hope none of the workers were hurt though. They are blameless. I will check up on them, let them know the Thieves Guild will help them.",""
"200879108-0-42999","Hmm. Cosh is a name this one has been hearing recently. A newcomer to the Landing. It seems he or she has ambitions, perhaps. We will speak, Danni and I, about this new player in town and see what we can find out.",""
"200879108-0-43001","A lamp is brought forth.",""
"200879108-0-43003","The lamp glows in the darkness.",""
"200879108-0-43004","You step out of the game, I guess. nnVelsa just said she had saved enough to get herself a nice, private set-up. She told Nicholas and the rest of us to leave her alone. Once in a while I see her in the markets but she keeps to herself.",""
"200879108-0-43005","Nothing dramatic. She just rubs people the wrong way. I think she does it on purpose, to keep people at a distance. nnShe's competitive though. As was I, when I was first coming up. Nicholas made me his second in command, which angered her.",""
"200879108-0-43006","Cosh? I heard that there was a new rich merchant settling into that castle up on the hill, flashing a lot of coin around. So it seems like his plans might be to work on his own, not with the guild.",""
"200879108-0-43007","Find out more about him, for a start. We need to know what he wants. And then we'll need to show him that working with the guild is the way to be… profitable here in Hew's Bane.",""
"200879108-0-43009","Cosh! I've heard that name more than once today. According to Silver-Claws, he's a merchant prince and he has a lot of friends in Abah's Landing. Him cozying up to the Violet Lamp can't be good for us.",""
"200879108-0-43010","That's too bad. I was hoping you'd be able to discredit those who've been causing the Thieves Guild trouble.nnDid you learn anything useful?",""
"200879108-0-43011","Cosh! I've heard that name more than once today. According to Silver-Claws, he's a merchant prince and he has a lot of friends in Abah's Landing. Him cozying up to the Violet Lamp can't be good for us.",""
"200879108-0-43012","Very good. He'll recognize those ""upstanding citizens"" for the crooks they are. That should get some of the heat off the Thieves Guild.nnDid you learn anything useful while you were there?",""
"200879108-0-43013","What? That's impossible. If Cosh is after that, we might all be in trouble.nnI'm going to have to give this some serious thought … and find out more about him!",""
"200879108-0-43014","What? That's impossible. If Cosh is after that, we might all be in trouble.nnI'm going to have to give this some serious thought … and find out more about him!",""
"200879108-0-43015","Yes. Business is good and the contracts are rolling in. We need to get you to work as soon as possible. But first, have you finished making your introductions to the rest of the family?",""
"200879108-0-43016","Very well. I'll be waiting.",""
"200879108-0-43017","On to business then. I assume you heard the chatter about our last initiate?",""
"200879108-0-43018","On to business then. I assume you heard the chatter about our last initiate?",""
"200879108-0-43019","On to business then. Perhaps you heard the chatter about our last initiate? Dead before his time. Listen to me, follow my instructions clearly, and perform your contracts skillfully. Otherwise you may meet the same fate.",""
"200879108-0-43020","On to business then. Perhaps you heard the chatter about our last initiate? Dead before his time. Listen to me, follow my instructions clearly, and perform your contracts skillfully. Otherwise you may meet the same fate.",""
"200879108-0-43021","Why do you keep asking that? It's a simple enough matter.nnI misjudged the ability of our ship's captain to properly navigate to the destination we specified. Really, it was an honest mistake on my part. The man sold himself as a proper sailor.",""
"200879108-0-43022","Well, I can't pinpoint precisely where the captain erred, but I'm a scholar, not a sailor. If someone asked me to translate a Dwemer scroll, I'd certainly do that correctly.nnI can only hope our next captain proves competent.",""
"200879108-0-43023","That's very kind of you, but while Kireth and I come from modest means, we won't accept charity. nnWe've made our way in this world quite successfully, and we'll continue to earn our own way. All we require is the chance to prove ourselves.",""
"200879108-0-43024","Well, the blacksmith did express an interest in my services, but his demands proved quite unreasonable.nnAlso, a local fisherman offered a promising opportunity but refused to compensate me. Rubbish about poor work. As if I'd do anything poorly!",""
"200879108-0-43025","The so-called ""Bank of Anvil"" has a reputation for serving its clients … poorly. I offered my bookkeeping services to the proprietor, a burly Nord, but he simply dismissed me.nnIf you convince him to reconsider, he would find me an asset.",""
"200879108-0-43026","Oh, that's a tale. My brother insists our captain erred, but I peeked at the charter they signed before that surly Redguard marooned us here.nnRaynor clearly chartered a ship to Anvil, not Sentinel. So, once again, this debacle is my brother's fault.",""
"200879108-0-43027","He confused the names! Over dinner, after we'd set sail, he told me how excited he was to see the towers of Anvil.nnI reminded him we were sailing to Sentinel, of course, and then he excused himself and ran to the captain. By then it was too late.",""
"200879108-0-43028","A Redguard merchant told us a group of miners recently unearthed a new Dwemer ruin near Hammerfell's shipyard, near Tava's Blessing. Entirely unexplored!n nIf Raynor and I reach it before the scavengers, we'll no doubt find relics of great worth.",""
"200879108-0-43029","Of course not! We're not trophy hunters, not like all those other Dwarf-Hounds. Our goal is to learn more about the Dwemer and how they vanished. Who were they? How did they live?nnAlso, acquiring intact relics is important to our academic standing.",""
"200879108-0-43031","At the risk of sounding presumptuous, I have quite the singing voice. I've sung in taverns across Deshaan, and received a standing ovation in Narsis!nnI sang a few bars for the tavern keeper, but he turned me down. He clearly lacks taste. And sense.",""
"200879108-0-43032","That rowdy Dark Elf sent you, didn't she? I'll tell you what I told her.nnSailors with broken fingers can't raise mugs, and sailors without mugs can't drink. Any barmaid who can't handle a little honest attention has no business in my establishment.",""
"200879108-0-43034","Arkay's beard, you're serious! I'm not looking for trouble, but I've got a business to run. You can't hold me responsible for every bawdy sailor who drinks here!nnLook. I'll hire your girl for one day, and pay her double. That's the best I can do.",""
"200879108-0-43038","Hmm. I've had jokers, and I've had singers, but I've never had a singer who was the joke. Still, this crowd can't sing at all and some might love her. Ha. They all might love her!n nSend her right over. I'll book her for the night and pay her well.",""
"200879108-0-43040","Wait a moment. You're talking about that Kireth woman, aren't you? She's the worst carpenter I've ever seen, and that includes the drunk ones!nnI just finished paying to have her work ripped out. She did more damage than she fixed!",""
"200879108-0-43044","Yes! The dungman who's idea of mending is 'tie a knot and hope for the best'! Shantin's nets had more holes after he finished, a trick worthy of Rahjin!nnYou come seeking payment, yes? This one fears you will be disappointed. Shantin was cheated.",""
"200879108-0-43046","Shantin has certainly misheard you, yet your coin does not lie. You wish to pay Shantin to pay Raynor to fix Shantin's nets, with coin left for profit? You have been sampling mooncakes, yes?nnStill, coin is coin. You have a deal, moon-addled one.",""
"200879108-0-43050","Ha! You've got mead in your blood, I'll give you that. So you vouch for this little snowback? You really think he can balance this mess? nnPah. What have I got to lose? Tell the Dark Elf he's got a job. He can't possibly make things worse.",""
"200879108-0-43052","Aye, the skinny Dunmer lad. He seemed like an honest sort, so I gave him a fair chance, but I don't think he's ever lifted more than a book.nnHad to let him go. Can't pay a man who can't do the work.",""
"200879108-0-43055","Enchanting, you say? I've heard of that. Don't care much for magic, but I have seen enchanted blades sell for prices far beyond the steel.nnThat would be a fair trade. If the lad agrees to enchant a few swords, I'll pay him fairly.",""
"200879108-0-43056","That's wonderful! Absolutely wonderful! Kireth, did you hear that? I told you all we needed to gain employment was someone who could deal with these pirates as equals.nnNot to imply you're a pirate, friend. Just … you know how to talk to them.",""
"200879108-0-43058","I knew he'd reconsider! With my education and unique skills, I'll have the bank's records balanced in a day. I might even enjoy it!nnThank you for showing that Nord the folly of generalizations.",""
"200879108-0-43059","Excellent! Put the screws to him, did you? Tightened the knots?nnThank you, friend. It vexes me to be cheated when I did good, honest work. I have a natural talent for mending nets, you know. Comes easily to me! Shantin won't be disappointed.",""
"200879108-0-43060","Enchanting, you say? How fascinating! I have done a bit of that. Why, I enchanted my own dagger, and it worked wonderfully until it calcified.nnBut, that's neither here nor there. I'll ensure the blacksmith gets his coin's worth. You have my word!",""
"200879108-0-43061","Interesting. Just how just how did you arrange that deal? nnNo matter. I earned my pay last night and I'll earn it again. And if that lout keeps his rabble in line, no more broken fingers. Everyone wins!",""
"200879108-0-43063","Ha! Did you threaten to report her for shoddy hiring practices? Or did she finally grow a conscience?nnNo matter. I can't say carpentry is my chosen profession, but I'll do what I'm paid to do. Unlike my often addled brother, I never disappoint.",""
"200879108-0-43065","I knew he would come around! This was a ploy to drive the price down, wasn't it? Thank you for talking some sense into him. Fair coin for fair work, as I often say.nnOoh, what will I sing? What would a bunch of pirates like? So many choices.",""
"200879108-0-43067","Regretfully, no. As much as this one admires Danni and the clever ways of this guild, one still cannot be seen to be… overtly involved.  Surely you can understand that?",""
"200879108-0-43068","It is a saying. You know. like hand in hoof? Wait, that does not sound correct.nnIn any case, it means this one should not be too obvious when helping the Thieves Guild.",""
"200879108-0-43069","Indeed. This one wants to help. Did you not hear me say the word ""overtly""? This is a good word, rolls of the tongue, does it not? I help, because I prefer to work with Danni, but I must be careful of appearing too much in the glove of the guild.",""
"200879108-0-43070","To be successful in Abah's Landing, one must have ears and eyes in many places and use them judiciously. This seemed like a good occasion to ask a favor of a certain baker who has many patrons. Including the quartermaster for the Violet Lamp.",""
"200879108-0-43073","I think I may know way we can sneak in, saw it when I was exploring a while back. I'll go now and scout it out more carefully. nnWe can all meet at the copse of trees not too far from the fort, on the main road. I'll find you all there.",""
"200879108-0-43074","""We""?nnWhy do none of you want to believe I am retired. Ree. Tired.",""
"200879108-0-43075","Very well, I shall join you. If, for nothing else, the chance to knock out that self-important puffed up swit, Rhanbiq. nnAlso, It might be fun for Danni to be in my debt.",""
"200879108-0-43077","Of course! We must help her. Danni is brave and is a good leader of our guild. nnBesides, none of us want to do it. I don't like drawing attention to myself. Velsa just plain doesn't like anyone or anything. And Quen, she's too inexperienced.",""
"200879108-0-43079","Yes. An Argonian in a soldier costume, very obvious. It's the tail. Hard to miss.nnWe need a side entrance. Lightly guarded means a bored or lonesome sentry on duty. I know how to distract a mark. A guard with the boring post is an easy task.",""
"200879108-0-43080","A couple of things. First, the treasure we're going after is a very specific item: A gold-plated skull, looted from an ancient tomb.nnAnything else you find, you can keep, but that's our prize.",""
"200879108-0-43081","Second, there's to be no killing. The guards in the Homestead are pretty tough, so that might not be a problem. If they spot us, our only recourse is to run away. If we get caught, they'll force us to pay off our bounty or run.",""
"200879108-0-43082","Yes. The master of Fulstrom is away on business. There aren't many guards on the grounds, and I'm guessing none in the manor house.nnOnce we're inside, stealing the treasure and getting out again should be easy.",""
"200879108-0-43083","It gets better. In order to enter the Homestead's manor house, we have to unlock a portcullis.nnI'm guessing the portcullis is locked from the inside, but we'll give it a try. If it is locked, I should be able to climb over the wall and let you in.",""
"200879108-0-43084","I sure did! And only one bored sentry. Walks already went ahead and is watching him, waiting for you. nnI got up on top of the wall too. Wasn't spotted, no one is set up too close to that small entrance.",""
"200879108-0-43085","All right. I'm going back up on the wall, make sure no random patrol heads toward that old gate area. nnMeet you inside!",""
"200879108-0-43086","I have been observing.. Here is what we shall do.nn We shall walk up, I will appear to be a little inebriated. He will challenge us, He'll likely tell us to move along. Just let me do the talking.",""
"200879108-0-43088","Such a pessimist. He is bored. He keeps checking through the gate, clearly looking for one of his mates to come by. He won't suspect a drunk, dapper Argonian. nnAnd you should try to look… non-threatening. If possible.",""
"200879108-0-43089","You'll have to get in without being detected. Only way to do that is to look the part, and well, the harder of the two, actually have an invite.nnBut I think I have a way of getting around that.",""
"200879108-0-43090","Lord Munya is often out and about in the market square. There's a good chance he has his on him. He's paranoid; doesn't leave anything lying around.nnThen Lady Faisha in the manor district has one. She most likely has it locked away in her home.",""
"200879108-0-43091","If you can secure an invite, I could easily forge a version with your name, or a fake name. It'll be good enough to get you and whoever else we need inside.nnWe just need to get one. I know of two nobles who were invited. They're the key.",""
"200879108-0-43092","I know! It doesn't make sense. This was supposed to be a safe job …",""
"200879108-0-43093","Perhaps the Inspector's quarters or office? There is a good chance he is keeping her close. And if not, he will have papers, evidence, that will provide details on where she is being held. He is the type to keep many reports.",""
"200879108-0-43094","Better we split up for a bit. Velsa will stick near you. Quen is scouting around. I will mingle with some of the serving staff, see what they know. nnYou should try to avoid the Iron Wheel, when possible. And be careful with that Inspector.",""
"200879108-0-43096","What is this… Oh, by Tava's torn soul.nnThat leaves my personal fortune in shambles. Damn the man. I had plans for that money, to finally be independent, to rise to a position of influence in Faharajad's court.",""
"200879108-0-43097","How would you ""help"" me? Sell the palace for me and take a cut? So I can sail back to Tanrith with fewer prospects and a future of boredom?",""
"200879108-0-43099","That is imposs… no, that is brilliant. Or it could be. nnHere. This is the evidence on Danni. Rhanbiq put her and Cosh in the old fort dungeon. I will lead you to the dungeon door. Stay with me or the Iron Wheel might attack you.",""
"200879108-0-43100","Right to the point. You and I, we can talk business. My former colleagues are a bit too emotional, it would seem. nnSo, you need to know where Danni was taken. And I need a certain… tool of the trade. A lockpick.",""
"200879108-0-43101","You have good sense, friend.  nnRhanbiq feels he has a very strong case against Danni for illegalities. He is shipping her off to Sentinel, to show progress in his crusade to clean up the Landing. You should find her on a boat, in the harbor.",""
"200879108-0-43104","I didn't ask you to free me. I just want a lockpick, so that I can depart at an opportune time. If you don't want to, that is fine. But you'll need to hunt down the Prison Warden to find where they took your precious Danni.nnThink on it, friend.",""
"200879108-0-43105","My name is Walk-Softly and I'm a member of the Abah's Landing Thieves Guild .. or what's left of it. The Violet Lamp, who you've just had the pleasure of escaping from, have made it their mission to destroy us.nnWe'd like to avoid that.",""
"200879108-0-43106","They think Quen is part of the Thieves Guild and wanted to question her about a recent theft. Quen is a promising thief that, ironically, I was sent to observe. I only learned of the Violet Lamp's plan right before they sprung their trap.",""
"200879108-0-43107","They are an independent law enforcement agency from Sentinel. While technically operating outside of their jurisdiction, local governments give them a wide berth because of their reputation for ""justice"" and ""efficiency.""nnNot everyone agrees.",""
"200879108-0-43108","We're thieves, but we have a code. Unfortunately, the Violet Lamp isn't picky about applying their justice and our numbers have been decimated.nnYou need to talk to our Guildmaster. in Abah's Landing if you want to know more.",""
"200879108-0-43109","Getting you out of trouble, or into it in the first place?nnWell, we had little enough to do with either. Still, I'm happy you both made it to Abah's Landing. I'd be even happier if you made it out with the <<1>>.",""
"200879108-0-43111","I'm not surprised. The Violet Lamp are crazed.nnLook, you and Quen did a great job breaking into the steading, and getting out was nothing short of miraculous. I'd like you to join the Thieves Guild. The Lamp thinks you're one of us anyway.",""
"200879108-0-43112","You had the sense to surrender your ill gotten goods when we first met. Though I am sorry to see you seem intent on keeping company with a group of thieving rogues.nnSay your piece, but don't expect me to change my plans.",""
"200879108-0-43113","You! Of course you keep company with this group of thieving rogues. They pretend to work for the merchants of Abah's Landing, but they are thieves. nnGo ahead, state your piece. If nothing else, it will amuse me.",""
"200879108-0-43114","I don't doubt it, but I've had Danni in my sights for a while as well. Both of them will see justice in Sentinel, if I have my way.nnWait a minute! How did you get in here? I am going to have the whole lot of you miscreants rounded up at once!",""
"200879108-0-43115","Well, I've got him too, you see. Danni is heading to Sentinel, where she will finally face justice.nnAnd just how did you get in here? I shall have all of you miscreants rounded up at once!",""
"200879108-0-43116","Adara'hai, of the Twilight Cantors. And you?",""
"200879108-0-43117","Ah yes. Adara'hai has heard of you. My sister sang you an aria when news of Molag Bal's failure came to our temple. It was a cool Pahmar night—perfect weather for a hero's song. This one would hum you a few bars, but it's still too dangerous.",""
"200879108-0-43118","Adara'hai is thinking she should know you, but the name does not ring any chimes. Forgive me. We Twilight Cantors spend most days sleeping. We miss a great deal.nnThis one would sing you the welcome song if she could, but it is still too dangerous.",""
"200879108-0-43119","It seems silly, yes?nnWe have to be very careful when dro-m'Athra are near. Namiira's eyes are fixed on us. She is looking for unlocked doors to our hearts—rattling the hinges, you see? Hold an honest note for too long and she'll snatch you up.",""
"200879108-0-43120","No, no. Aggression is one of Namiira's shadows. You need a moon dreamer's song to shake off the bent spirits. Something holy and unpredictable.nnThis one would rather sing a simple melody, but simple songs are no good for exorcisms. Var var var.",""
"200879108-0-43121","There are many different kinds of songs, yes? Like there are many kinds of touch. Some touches are gentle and intimate, others are firm, like a tradesman's handshake. nnThen there are the touches we save for our enemies. The bites and raking claws.",""
"200879108-0-43122","Of course. The dro-m'Athra are bent spirits. Moon-haters. The children of the Daedric shadow-lady, Namiira that dance in the Dark Behind the World. We rarely speak of them. Raises the hackles, you know? nnAdara'hai wishes she knew less.",""
"200879108-0-43123","As well as any true cat can. This one has seen things … things that do not wash out.nnThe Chief Crier says horror is good. The moment we do not recoil is the moment Namiira claims us. So this one tries to find beauty in the fear. Then she sings.",""
"200879108-0-43124","Yes. At least they should. Some dro-m'Athra are very strong. Their pounding can bend the strongest tails. Singing to a beast like that is very dangerous. That is why they send Adara'hai. This one's voice is the purest and strongest. nnLucky me, eh?",""
"200879108-0-43125","Music is a powerful, mysterious thing, walker.nnThe dro-m'Athra use it for evil, seducing us with the Bent Dance. The steps are simple, easy to fall into, yes? Once you hear the drumming, it's very hard to escape. So our songs must be stronger.",""
"200879108-0-43126","It is called the Temple of Seven Riddles—home to the Doubting Monks. Or at least it was.nnIt is a holy place, but not a good place.",""
"200879108-0-43127","Not as glad as I was to see you and the others. nnSo, that was interesting, meeting Lady Falorah on the boat.",""
"200879108-0-43129","Well, that is an interesting turn of events. Have to admire a woman who can make gold from dross like Nicholas.nnSpeaking of which, where is he?",""
"200879108-0-43130","The Clan Mothers say they built the temple too tall. Khajiit aren't meant to stand so close to the ja'Kha'jay before the dead-climb. Pilgrims who come here can see the Bright Moons, yes. But some can see the Ghost Moon too. Lorkhaj.",""
"200879108-0-43131","Who can say? Maybe it was seeing the Ghost Moon. Maybe the priests had dark hearts and found Namiira on their own. Whatever the case, the priests danced the Bent Dance and the temple became a haven for dro-m'Athra. nnIt was a very bad time.",""
"200879108-0-43132","Until now.nnThese monks say that the Moon Bishop Kulan-dro broke the seal somehow. Adara'hai does not know why Kulan-dro would do something so foolish. Most cats who fall to the dro-m'Athra are lured by promises of power, though. Tragic, yes?",""
"200879108-0-43133","Our ancestors sang them away, just as we will.nnThe Riddle-hymn says that the battle took many years. Once the Chief Crier sang the final verse of the exorcist's song, Moon Bishops sealed the breach with a lunar ward.",""
"200879108-0-43134","This should be easy enough to forge some fake names on here.nnNow, a last couple of things before we really get ready. Danni wants to keep the numbers low for the mission, but have enough eyes in there. That means you'll need a date.",""
"200879108-0-43135","Well, you're not just going to go in with some armor and ""fit in"". So yes, you'll need to go by the tailor shop and get an outfit.nnBut first, pick someone to go with you tonight.",""
"200879108-0-43136","Hey, not my call. You can bring that up with Danni if you want.nnYou just need to choose a date to go with you tonight, then we'll worry about getting you an outfit picked out.",""
"200879108-0-43137","Thank you for asking, but I'm already going. Pick someone else to bring along.",""
"200879108-0-43138","Me? I'm not a part of the guild. I'm flattered though… I mean if you really want me to go.",""
"200879108-0-43139","Then this one will be your date.",""
"200879108-0-43141","Oh, this is going to be so much fun.",""
"200879108-0-43142","Oh, I have waited for you to say such a thing. Are you sure?",""
"200879108-0-43143","Parties are my specialty.",""
"200879108-0-43144","You can't be serious?",""
"200879108-0-43145","Well, if there's going to be wine, I suppose I'll go.",""
"200879108-0-43146","I'd appreciate that. They don't know you as well as they know me. Use a servant's disguise and only the really alert officers will notice anything wrong.nnOf course, a disguise won't get you downstairs.",""
"200879108-0-43147","I heard a servant talking about a pass-phrase. The Lamp writes it down in three parts and gives a page to each group inside the upper area of the fort.nnFind the dispatches and you should be able to get inside lower Hiradirge.",""
"200879108-0-43148","Lamp officers use pass-phrases. It's possible some of their servants have heard one or two of them, but the Lamp're pretty paranoid. They change the phrases out constantly.nnThat works in our favor, though. They send out new phrases in dispatches.",""
"200879108-0-43149","Anywhere inside the ruin. Disguised as a servant, you should be able to move around there safely … but don't let them see you stealing their orders! If they attack you, no disguise'll get you out safely.",""
"200879108-0-43150","As long as you're disguised as one of them, you might as well find out what they know. But if you lose your disguise, don't expect them to give you the time of day! The Violet Lamp is pretty strict with its help.nnStill, it's worth trying.",""
"200879108-0-43152","Spy on those damned conspirators and find out what the Violet Lamp has planned. We need information!nnIf you can, plant the evidence you and Silver-Claws compiled somewhere the Lamp will find it. If you can discredit the conspirators, that will help.",""
"200879108-0-43153","Somebody gets a fancy hat. Can't toss a rock in Abah's Landing without hitting a captain or a commodore. Toothless runts fancy themselves a proper navy!nnEveryone wants to impress the new admiral, so it's time to polish her brass and lick her boots.",""
"200879108-0-43154","Aye, and we've held it since I hung the last of those cannibal Woof Elves from a yardarm. Never could stomach cannibalism. Ha! That's a joke, mate.nnWe named it 'Garroter's Grotto' because we garotte anyone I don't like. Subtle and pirates don't mix.",""
"200879108-0-43155","Too many idiots and not enough garrotes. Sure, I could spend all day stabbing these Elf-lovers in the neck, but who has that kind of time? I've got a protection racket to run!nnBetter to remind them who owns the place and scare the lot of them off.",""
"200879108-0-43156","You may enter.",""
"200879108-0-43157","Ah, yes. Feel free to pick any of them. Free of charge.",""
"200879108-0-43158","You can't go to a wedding unless you're looking amazing. So no, you can't just go in what you have.nnPick your outfit, and we'll make sure you're all set this evening.",""
"200879108-0-43159","Well, any of the four you see before you. Select one, I'll wrap it up and make sure you have it for this evening.",""
"200879108-0-43164","You'll meet up with your partner and get inside the manor. That should be the easy part.",""
"200879108-0-43165","We'll figure that out once the party is going. Just don't gain any unwanted attention.nnHere's your invite, custom forged and everything.",""
"200879108-0-43166","Once you're inside, you need to distract the guards and get the gate open. I just need enough time to actually get inside. Once I'm in, we're in the clear.",""
"200879108-0-43167","Professional? No, it is nothing so cold. This is a vocation. To be a Cantor is to live a life of song, and wine, and prayer.nnBeauty is too great a thing to be caged by profession, no?",""
"200879108-0-43169","It is our duty. On most nights we lounge under the stars and sing the seventeen Kha'jay Sahaalas. On other nights … we do darker work.nnKhajiit are children of two fates, walker. Two moons, two kingdoms, two parents. So it is with the Cantors.",""
"200879108-0-43170","I need to pick up a few things. After that, I'll meet you at the estate's entrance. The gate appears to be barred from the inside, but I can climb over the wall and let you in.nnYou need to get us past the guards and open the manor door.",""
"200879108-0-43171","She said she'd wait for everyone to get inside, then she'd be ready. We just have to figure out how to get her inside is all.",""
"200879108-0-43172","We search for information regarding my father. It's possible he is there, but I doubt it. He would've gotten word to me somehow. No, we go there and we look around. Hopefully, we get another clue to his whereabouts.nnOh, and you'll need lockpicks.",""
"200879108-0-43173","No! They're Abah's Landing guards—the Guild doesn't need that kind of trouble!nnThe fact they're patrolling the grounds has me worried, though. Whose estate is it? If it's my father's, do the guards have him trapped there? I've got to find out!",""
"200879108-0-43174","She said she'd wait for everyone to get inside, then she'd be ready. We just have to figure out how to get her inside is all.",""
"200879108-0-43175","She said she'd wait for everyone to get inside, then she'd be ready. We just have to figure out how to get her inside is all.",""

"200879108-0-43177","Excellent. I'll just need to see your invite.",""
"200879108-0-43178","Don't want any riff-raff getting inside. This is for Lord Cosh! If we wanted to invite the peasants of Abah's Landing, he'd just leave the door open.nnWe need to make sure it's secure. We'll move our guards inside, so don't you worry!",""
"200879108-0-43179","Let me see here. Yes, everything looks correct. You are free to enter. If you need to change, rooms are available once inside.nnWhen the party starts, we'll be locking the doors, so make sure you have everything you need.",""
"200879108-0-43180","I want justice for my lost friends. I want peace of mind, I suppose. nnIf he was put on trial in Sentinel, that would've been all right with me. But he was not on The Anemone when she docked. He just vanished. So I started to put out some feelers.",""
"200879108-0-43181","My most recent information has him snooping around Marbruk of all places. I suggest you search the city's inns.nnMaybe Nicholas went to ground in some cave or brigands camp in Greenshade? I don't know much about the place.",""
"200879108-0-43182","I've heard he was digging around Shornhelm, of all places. Ask around at the city's inns.nn I don't know much about the Rivenspire, though I have passed through it. Gloomy country, if you ask me. Maybe a good place to hide, if you were Nicholas.",""
"200879108-0-43183","Last I heard, he was trying to dig up dirt in Shornhelm. I suggest you search the city's inns.nnI hear Shornhelm is a curious city, partly an old Ayleid ruin. Perhaps the swamps of Shadowfen can provide good cover for Nicholas, if he is in hiding.",""
"200879108-0-43184","Nothing really concrete yet. However, I did learn that I was not the only one searching for him.nnWhich is where you come in. Inspector Rhanbiq, who resigned from the Violet Lamp, seems determined to find Nicholas. So he may have some information.",""
"200879108-0-43185","Not Inspector any more. Thanks to you and your cronies.nnIs this visit coincidence? Or did you come to gloat?",""
"200879108-0-43186","I can't touch your friend Danni, thanks to the fact that all evidence I had on her seemed to ""magically"" disappear.  I do have evidence on Nicholas, though. I want him behind bars. No one makes a fool out of me.nnMaybe we have a mutual interest here.",""
"200879108-0-43187","Okay, I'll be just a second.",""
"200879108-0-43188","Honor among thieves, eh? Well, you've got at least a modicum of honor. nnMy notes are in a chest, upstairs. Here's the key. I've traced him to Grahtwood. If I could find your thieves refuges, I'd ask around there. If I were you. Which I am not.",""
"200879108-0-43189","Honor among thieves, eh? Well, you've got at least a modicum of honor. nnMy notes are in a chest, upstairs. Here's the key. I've traced him to Alik'r. If I could find your thieves refuges, I'd ask around there. If I were you. Which I am not.",""

"200879108-0-43191","That's your argument? So I'll just hand over my key do you can get my notes? You would probably just give him a stern scolding.nnNo thanks, I'll manage on my own. Sooner or later I'll get in one of your refuges and get more information.",""
"200879108-0-43192","And you expect help from me? I should just hand over my notes to you? Ha! I've got him traced to an area, and I'll figure out where he is with no help from you.nnThere's no honor among thieves. You showed that when you stole the treasure.",""
"200879108-0-43193","We need to do things.",""
"200879108-0-43194","Things and stuff.",""
"200879108-0-43195","That guard is watching the door pretty closely. You could try figuring out a way to convince him to leave his station. It'd be long enough for Danni to slip in.nnOr we cause a distraction.",""
"200879108-0-43196","Yeah. Steal something off one of these nobles. Make sure they realize it. If anything they'll start crying out and get his attention.nnMight just want to talk to him first though. Could be the easiest way.",""
"200879108-0-43197","We need to do things.",""
"200879108-0-43198","Things and stuff.",""
"200879108-0-43199","We need to do things.",""
"200879108-0-43200","Things and stuff.",""
"200879108-0-43201","Well, you wouldn't be in here if you weren't one of us. Unlike that stiff piece of work, Ram's Beak. Or whatever his name is, nnHeard he's been asking around about an Imperial. I might know something. I know lots of things.",""
"200879108-0-43202","I had no idea! I mean, Val sometimes said things, but I didn't know he had a daughter.nnBy the gods, is she the one who's been trying to get in to see me?",""
"200879108-0-43203","Now that you mention it… was an Imperial fellow, didn't go by Nicholas though.  nnStayed here for a bit, wooed a rather well-off widow. I heard his wife talk about a home she had, some lovely little island, near Haven. That's in Grahtwood.",""
"200879108-0-43204","Now that you mention it… was an Imperial fellow, though he didn't go by Nicholas.  nnStayed here for a bit, wooed a rather well-off widow. I heard his wife talk about a home she had near Sentinel, in Alik'r. A private island all her own. Rich folk.",""

"200879108-0-43206","More like couldn't! Ever since Val was killed, the Violet Lamp have been trying to get in here to ""talk"" with me. I've heard what they do to people they want to ""talk"" to! I called in every favor I could to get city guards to patrol the estate!",""
"200879108-0-43207","I don't, but I might have a clue. Val used to keep all his business things in this secret room.nnI've searched it and I found this ledger. It's in code, but perhaps it can point us toward where he went. I'm willing to share it with his daughter.",""
"200879108-0-43209","They had enough time. Should have gotten inside already if they had an invite. Can't do anything about it now.",""
"200879108-0-43210","I'll give you a couple moments. Maybe go grab myself a drink. Or two.nnI don't expect to see you or your friend by the time I get back, got it?",""
"200879108-0-43211","You're going to be nagging me all night if I don't do this, aren't you?nnListen, I'm stepping away only for a moment. Don't be here hanging around this door when I get back.",""
"200879108-0-43212","Wouldn't be a very good door guard if I did that, would I?nnOnly way I'm leaving this place is if there's an emergency on the grounds. And since no one's getting inside to cause an emergency, it shouldn't be an issue.",""
"200879108-0-43213","For you? I need you to find out where Falorah is and a way to get into the manor. I'm going to look around and see if I can find out anything about this manor. Who knows when we might need a quick escape.",""

"200879108-0-43216","You could try the door, but I imagine they have it locked down until they tell people to move inside.nnIf we have any hope of getting in there, we'll need to find another way in.",""
"200879108-0-43217","Thank you. And tell her she can come see me again, when she's more settled.nnIn the meantime, you can leave through Val's secret exit and bypass the guards. We don't want the Lamp finding out you were here. That'll just make more trouble.",""
"200879108-0-43218","Did she? Good. I lead the biggest, meanest crew of cutthroats and scoundrels in Abah's Landing. The Shark's Teeth! This grotto is our turf.nnWe've held it through sweat, moxie, and blood for years, and I won't let these pirates ransack it.",""
"200879108-0-43220","Why do pirates do anything? Because they're idiots. Someone named a new admiral and the next day we were knee deep in bootlickers, all seeking gifts to impress her.nnThose gifts are our loot, mate, stolen fair and square. Nobody loots our loot!",""
"200879108-0-43221","Right. My father made provisions for friends of his in the Guild to recover the treasure and send it to me in case he disappeared, but with all that's been happening, no one followed through.nnIt's up to me to recover the treasure.",""
"200879108-0-43222","I'll grab some shovels and other equipment and meet you near the dig site. I don't want to wait a moment longer!nnHere, you take the map. I know where I'm going.",""
"200879108-0-43223","I've … talked to her a few times since we first met. She's nice, and I think she really did love my father. But I don't need to involve her in this.nnBesides, look at her estate—she certainly doesn't need any buried treasure!",""
"200879108-0-43225","It would seem you made a futile journey to our private little corner. There is no Nicholas here.nnMy husband Vantus is here with me. The only other man here is our general manservant, Azogu.",""
"200879108-0-43226","I do mind. My Vantus is a poet. He struggles with his muse. It is why we spend much of our time here. I will not disturb him at this time nnI will have to ask you to leave. I am sorry you made such a long trip for nothing.",""
"200879108-0-43227","Now that you mention it… was an Imperial fellow, though he didn't go by Nicholas.  nnStayed here for a bit, wooed a rather well-off widow. I heard his wife talk about a home she had near Sentinel, in Alik'r. A private island all her own. Rich folk.",""
"200879108-0-43228","Well, there was an Imperial fellow, though he didn't go by Nicholas. Not very friendly.nnStayed here for a bit, wooed a rather well-off widow. I heard his wife talk about a pleasant little island home she had in Deshaan, near some fortress. Tal""Deic.",""
"200879108-0-43229","She's getting ready, but why go to her directly?nnListen, if you want to try and talk her out of this, she's dead set on it. I tried, trust me. Unless you're looking for her for something else, then I didn't say anything.",""
"200879108-0-43230","You have a quality about you that I like… I can't put my finger on it.nnWhat's your favorite drink, eh? Bet you that's why I like you. I can spot a fellow drinker of good spirits any day of the week!",""
"200879108-0-43231","But you can convince Quen! Please, my life is in your hands.nnI admit, I came here to steal the treasure, but I had good reason! The Violet Lamp put pressure on the guards—they've abandoned me! Without money to pay them, I'll lose my home!",""
"200879108-0-43234","I know, and I'm sorry. After Quen came to see me, the Violet Lamp tried to get at me again. The guards … they won't protect me without more money.nnI had to do something! I'm an old woman. Without money or a protector, I can't survive!",""
"200879108-0-43235","No, please! I'll never be safe in Abah's Landing again!nnI can't believe you're going to abandon me!",""
"200879108-0-43236","Thank you! I'm sure if you understand, Quen will, too. Please, tell her my home is her home, as long as she remains in Abah's Landing.nnI'm so sorry for what I did. I'll do what I can to make up for it.",""
"200879108-0-43237","It was partly mine, too! Val took care of me. He always provided for me and kept me safe.nnWith him gone …  I admit it … I panicked. I had Quen followed and tried to steal her inheritance. But I swear I didn't want anyone hurt!",""
"200879108-0-43238","A white wine? Really?nnWow, I must of had too much to drink. I had you pegged all wrong. Sorry, you'll have to excuse me, I need another drink.",""
"200879108-0-43239","Ah hah! I knew it! You and I? We're alike. Best friends forever. We should have a drink together.nnWhat's your favorite thing to pair with it, eh? Bet you we think alike there too.",""
"200879108-0-43241","Exactly! You and me, we need to get together sometime and just chat!nnEr, what was it you asked again? Oh yeah, my cousin. She's using Cosh's bed chambers in the back rooms of the manor. Good luck getting inside though.",""
"200879108-0-43242","Lamb? Ugh. You need to work on your tastes, that stuff is nasty.nnNow excuse me, I've worked up a thirst.",""
"200879108-0-43243","Fish? Really? With red wine?nnThat's… an interesting pairing. Not one I'd choose exactly. Maybe we aren't as alike as I thought. I'm going to go ahead and grab a drink. Alone. Please excuse me.",""
"200879108-0-43244","That's bad. Follow the trail of ink prints Locke left and rescue him before the Violet Lamps do something horrible. I'll find Danni and let her know what's going on.",""
"200879108-0-43245","What do you want?  I've left the game, I'm retired. I'm married. Living quietly.nnJust leave me be.",""
"200879108-0-43246","Of course I do.nnBut do you know what I want? I want something to do. I want… a drink. Let's make a deal, shall we? I'm not doing anything else.",""
"200879108-0-43250","I don't expect you to understand, but the loss of those lives weighs on me every day. I can't erase that. I can't expect Danni, who was a friend, to forgive me for embroiling her in my ambitions. nnIt all went wrong. So. What do you want from me>",""
"200879108-0-43251","There's a group over on the west side drinking my favorite wine. Since I'm not doing much else, I'd like a bottle of it. No one really can know about it though, so I'd prefer if you grab it. Discreetly.nnYou get me that wine, I'll talk to you.",""
"200879108-0-43252","Then I'm not interested in talking to you about Lady Falorah.nnChange your mind, and maybe we'll talk.",""
"200879108-0-43253","Bakhum is looking for his sister-in-law's uncle's cousin. We are very close.nnWhy do you make a face?",""
"200879108-0-43254","I… thank you. Vonulidai is a sweet soul. I promised myself I would do right by her. I'll stay out of sight. My days of cons and thieving are over. nnTell Danni… tell Danni I am truly sorry.",""
"200879108-0-43255","Does it? Well, what can Bakhum say? He values family.nnYou raise an interesting point though. Our Saturalia Baan-Dar gift swap does take a very, very long time ….",""
"200879108-0-43256","I know their plans. The Violet Lamp has set up a large camp outside Malooc's Tomb to protect it from more pillaging. However, I know a way to bypass the camp. Because you saved me, I'll go with you and help.",""
"200879108-0-43258","The Violet Lamps took him! They grabbed him and dragged him through the big door. They looked really angry.nnNow please, don't tell them I talked to you.",""
"200879108-0-43261","Cosh is letting her use his bedroom inside the manor. Upstairs, farthest room in the back.nnIf you think you're going to visit her though, good luck. The entire place is crawling with Rhambiq's people. Security's tight.",""
"200879108-0-43262","There's got to be someone who knows where Falorah is. Might want to look around and chat with folks.nnAs for getting in the manor? See if we can spot anyone going in and out of the building. If they have access, they probably have a key on them.",""
"200879108-0-43263","Yes. Yes, of course. Takanradh has always had a sugar-sweet disposition. He always asks about Bakhum's wife and children, and about Bakhum's shipping operation. So on and so on. But recently, his letters have turned sour.",""
"200879108-0-43264","A good leader… except when she gets captured. nnVery well. What's the plan? Do we rush in yelling like crazed Ashlanders, waving our daggers about threateningly? Perhaps you could ask the excitable Quen to turn cartwheels to distract the guards.",""
"200879108-0-43266","Very sour. He says that no one appreciates him. He says that his fellow monks are stealing from him, and spying on him. And he says he feels ill—twisted. He called it a ""creeping sickness,"" scraping away at the inside of his skull. nnHorrible, yes?",""
"200879108-0-43267","Now that we know the Violet Lamps are camped outside the tomb, we'll have to approach cautiously.nnLet's get underway!",""
"200879108-0-43268","Hah! Well done. I've got some info as well, though I'm not sure how much it'll help us.nnTurns out this place is filled with tons of hidden passages and what-not. I don't know if any of them lead outside, but we might want to keep an eye out.",""
"200879108-0-43269","Any minute now. Once he starts it up, we make our move and get inside.",""
"200879108-0-43270","I've still yet to see Nicholas, but I'm keeping my eye out.nnCosh is going to give a speech soon. It should be enough to distract everyone. We should slip into the side door while he's giving it.",""
"200879108-0-43271","Ah well. One would hope cooler heads and common sense would prevail. Not as if I truly need a lockpick, just would've made things easier. nnGood luck finding Danni. I have nothing more to discuss with you.",""
"200879108-0-43272","No one is truly who we believe they are. We all have our secrets. I understand this. Especially in this land.nnAs long as he is a good husband and we share our power equally, I do not care what he has hidden in his own shadow.",""
"200879108-0-43273","What are you implying exactly?",""
"200879108-0-43274","Your accusations are bordering on outrageous. You burst into my room while I prepare for my wedding and tell me that I should stop everything I have been preparing for months for.nnI do hope you have some evidence to back your claim.",""
"200879108-0-43275","Enough! This is foolish.nnMy escort will be arriving soon for the wedding, and you'll all see what the dungeons of these grounds look like, first hand.",""
"200879108-0-43276","Right. Go up the ladder over there. Velsa has a secret garden somewhere in among the empty buildings and alley ways. I'm sure there's a safer way in, but naturally she wouldn't share that with us. You'll just have to search.  nnBe careful.",""
"200879108-0-43277","I think she'll have to. There's no way Nicholas just ""stumbled"" onto this. This is our ticket to end him once and for all.nnBut that also means I need you to do something for me. One last task in this whole mess.",""
"200879108-0-43279","Now go. This room should have another pass somewhere that leads back into the manor. Get in place for the wedding and get ready to run if needed.nnStopping Nicholas all depends on this.",""
"200879108-0-43280","I'll be with Falorah, hopefully, revealing what Nicholas truly is— a liar.nnIf I say the words ""Cosh is an imposter"", take our friends and just… get out of here. Get back to our friends at the base and be there for them.",""
"200879108-0-43281","An unfortunate turn of events, but one that was always a possibility.nnWas he stopped though?",""
"200879108-0-43283","She knew what she was doing. And the job got done. That's all we can really ask for.nnThe Thieves Guild will celebrate our victory!",""
"200879108-0-43284","Sometimes she's at least a bit curious or at least… civil, to people she doesn't have an opinion on yet. I'm kind of hoping that she'll at least hear you out, even if she dismisses my concerns out of hand.",""
"200879108-0-43286","Just outside of town, I talked to a merchant named <<1>>. She indicated she might have a whole list of items stolen by the Merchant Prince's ruffians. But she wants money and I don't have any.",""
"200879108-0-43287","We've been played! Let's head back to Thieves Guild Headquarters, inform the others, and plan our next move.",""
"200879108-0-43288","I said I would and I will. Don't rush me. nnI was just thinking about this Cosh person that Iszreena mentioned. No one I know, but he sure seems to have sense that things were in a bit of… disarray here in Abah's Landing.",""
"200879108-0-43289","Sure. It will be amusing if she doesn't yet know that someone else is making a move. The Guild has alwaysnbeen the strong hand in the balance of power and trade here.nnGo on in and give Silver-Claws his ledger. I am just getting my thoughts together.",""
"200879108-0-43290","No opinion. But if I were running the thieves guild - not that I want to, being retired - I would damn well make it my business to learn everything I could about him.nnYou should get that ledger to Silver-Claws. He's probably shedding in anxiety.",""
"200879108-0-43291","This one is called Adara'hai, of the Twilight Cantors. And you?",""
"200879108-0-43292","It is Namiira, the Lady of Decay. We must be cautious when her children, the dro-m'Athra, are near. Her eyes are fixed on us. She's looking for unlocked doors to our hearts—rattling the hinges. Hold an honest note for too long and she'll have you.",""
"200879108-0-43293","Mmm, yes. Adara'hai has heard of you. My sister sang you an aria when news of Molag Bal's failure came to our temple. It was a cool Pahmar night—perfect weather for a hero's song.nnThis one would hum you a few bars, but it is still too dangerous.",""
"200879108-0-43294","Adara'hai is thinking she should know you, but the name does not ring chimes. Forgive me. We Twilight Cantors spend most days sleeping. We miss a great deal.nnThis one would sing you the welcome song if she could, but it is still too dangerous.",""
"200879108-0-43295","Forgive me. This one is called Adara'hai, of the Twilight Cantors.",""
"200879108-0-43296","Mm. Azurah's purring daughters. This is not ringing chimes?nnThe Cantors are nuns … of a sort. We worship the Moons through song, you see? Our nights are long and sacred—full of dozing and bathing and joyful music. Our bowl is full of blessings.",""
"200879108-0-43298","All blessings come at a cost, yes?nnWhen the dro-m'Athra pounce, the Cantors are summoned to sing them back to Oblivion. This is the way it has always been.",""
"200879108-0-43299","Yes. Just so.",""
"200879108-0-43300","Mm. Adara'hai is one of Azurah's purring daughters. On most nights, we Cantors lounge beneath the stars and sip Topal wine and sing the seventeen Khaj'ay Sahaalas. Other nights are … much less pleasant.",""
"200879108-0-43301","We sneak in a window, look around, get to the second level and out the door. Silver-Claws office is on top of the building.   nnI'll be placing some diversions that will soon sow confusion, so we can make our escape after you grab the ledger.",""
"200879108-0-43303","This helpful pirate is the skipper for the crew Decia hired to sail her to Eastmarch. She knows a Thane up there who may protect her.nnThis pirate was supposed to lead her back to his boat, but now he's going to sit here quietly. Or die.",""
"200879108-0-43304","I've heard complaints that someone's been preying on the people of Abah's Landing and passing the word that the Thieves Guild is behind the depredations.nnEverything from kidnapping to skooma smuggling—dirty business we don't soil our hands with.",""
"200879108-0-43306","Talk to Silver-Claws. He has contacts all over the city. Maybe he's heard the same rumors, or can point you toward people who might know more.nnFind out who's doing this and why, and see if you can collect evidence that clears us.",""
"200879108-0-43307","I have my own avenues to pursue. Certain high-class individuals will still talk to me, even with my recent fall in stature.nnMeet me back here when you've completed your investigations and we'll compare notes.",""
"200879108-0-43308","I know you've had trouble with the Violet Lamp, but that's nothing compared to what Danni's been through. She's seen the Guild go from an organization respected throughout the city to a shadow of what it was.nnShe's afraid of things getting worse.",""
"200879108-0-43309","She's upset. She's been trying to rebuild the Thieves Guild and she's done a good job … but now someone is trying to destroy it.nnDanni can't stand that the Guild might suffer another setback. She feels responsible.",""
"200879108-0-43310","That's a good idea! She might know one of the pass-phrases, too.nnI saw her go inside upper Hiradirge. Be careful, use your disguise, and you might be able to reach her. But don't expect her to talk to you unless she thinks you're a servant!",""
"200879108-0-43311","Lamp servants keep spare clothing in small baskets scattered around upper Hiradirge. If you need one, just sneak by the Lamp officers and steal one from one of these baskets.nnBut, remember, the disguise won't do you any good in lower Hiradirge!",""
"200879108-0-43312","According to the servant, the Lamp officers keep them in separate parts of the camp. Check out the outer area of upper Hiradirge, perhaps near the larger tents.",""
"200879108-0-43313","Wrong! Go away!",""
"200879108-0-43314","I'll kindle your embers if you don't leave!",""
"200879108-0-43315","No! Leave or I call the guard!",""
"200879108-0-43316","I had a feeling I'd be seeing you again. You do have a habit of wandering into the most disastrous situations.",""
"200879108-0-43317","He did, did he? Last time I saw that spineless skeever, him and Coris the mage were walking away. They left me under here to die.nnI heard them talking about the captain and the ambassador as they left.",""
"200879108-0-43318","Coldharbour. I'd prefer to forget about that dismal place. I lost a lot of good friends there. A lot. Poor Darien. Do you remember Darien? He was a good man.nnBah! Let's talk about something less depressing!",""
"200879108-0-43319","How should I know? This may shock you, but I'm not much of a ""keep in touch"" person. Honestly, I picked up my rucksack and walked not long after you left.nnThings probably settled down, but I doubt we got all the vampires. Creepy bastards.",""
"200879108-0-43323","The Winterborn, from the Reach. They ambushed us … leaped out of the damn snow.nnIt's like they knew we were coming. After that it was all a blur. By the gods, they turned people into ice! They shattered them!",""
"200879108-0-43325","Of course.",""
"200879108-0-43326","I'm not entirely certain, of course—one can never be certain of these things—but I think I've discovered the location of a major relic. nnIf I'm correct, it belonged to <<1>>, founder of Orsinium, and creator of its Bear-Rider cavalry!",""
"200879108-0-43328","<<1>>'s bear—<<2>>—was a mountain among hills. When <<1>> died, Torug entombed her remains in a cave long thought lost. Until now, according to this report!nnSo? Will you retrieve <<Cz:3>> for the House of Orsimer Glories?",""
"200879108-0-43330","No! He almost destroyed the guild! He got Danni in trouble. For all I know, maybe it was his fault my father died. nnWell, that last one probably isn't true, but it seems like something someone like him might do.",""
"200879108-0-43331","He behaved badly. But knowing where Danni is located now is more important than holding a long grudge. Give him a lockpick, it will save time.",""
"200879108-0-43332","On the one hand, Nicholas has shown himself to be a ruthless bastard. On the other hand… I don't really care. We should really just get a move on.",""
"200879108-0-43389","Ah, an inquisitive sort! I like it!nnI'm searching for a Nord beast-master named Nikolvara. My contacts tell me she possesses an enchanted whistle that can tame any creature in Tamriel. Marvelous, yes? Apparently she lives in a durzog lair nearby.",""
"204987124-2-42031","What can you tell me about <<z:1>>?",""
"204987124-0-41207","I want you to go with Eveli to High Priestess Solgra.",""
"204987124-0-41199","My reasons are my own. This should be enough.",""
"204987124-0-41331","We're leaving?",""
"204987124-0-41342","Any ideas on how I can get past the soldiers?",""
"204987124-0-41405","It's clear you both loved <<1>>. If Shatul must survive, you should support her—not accuse her.",""
"204987124-0-41761","Actually, one of the Winterborn helped me recover it.",""
"204987124-0-41925","Are you happy with the rebuilt Orsinium?",""
"204987124-0-41889","Consider it done.",""
"204987124-0-41857","Please. At least take a look at the letter.",""
"204987124-0-41427","Someone needs to stop the king.",""
"204987124-0-41450","You must have some idea about where we should look.",""
"204987124-0-41646","Why are you telling me this?",""
"204987124-0-42394","You work for the king?",""
"204987124-0-42492","I found this inside the ruins. Are you interested?",""
"204987124-0-42538","Any ideas on how I can get past the soldiers?",""
"204987124-0-39894","I see. What about <<1>>?",""

"204987124-0-42353","Why did the ogres take your books?",""
"204987124-0-42563","No thanks. That doesn't sound all that impressive.",""
"204987124-0-39967","If not <<1>>, then <<2>> must become chief.",""
"204987124-0-41410","How did <<1>> die?",""
"204987124-0-41324","Why do you need to kill the chiefs when they're willing to listen?",""
"204987124-0-41180","I can't wait to try it.",""
"204987124-0-41185","She also admitted to chanting outside the village.",""
"204987124-0-41212","It's sweet, but not too sweet.",""
"204987124-0-41920","I wish you well, King Bazrag.",""
"204987124-0-41767","Someone needs to stop the king.",""
"204987124-0-41494","There's another option. I could become chief of Shatul.",""
"204987124-2-41425","That wound looks pretty bad.",""
"204987124-2-42352","Enough about the past. Earlier you mentioned <<1>>. Who is that?",""
"204987124-0-42183","I think I hear another dragon priest! Quick, hide! <Trickn Narsis>",""
"204987124-0-41169","I gave you the mug. You should release <<1>>.",""

"204987124-0-41522","I've had enough of cultists and assassins. <Kill>",""

"204987124-0-41865","I almost forgot. Chief Bazrag wanted you to have this.",""
"204987124-0-41385","Any ideas?",""

"21337012-0-1949","I am Grand Chancellor Abnur Tharn, Overlord of Nibenay, the head of the Elder Council, advisor to emperors and kings for one hundred and seventeen of the one hundred and sixty-four years that I have been alive. I did not come by my position of influence through luck or nepotism, but rather through extreme discipline, ambition, and cunning. And yet, here I am, conspiring with idiots and fools in a musty hole in the ground. How the mighty have fallen.nnThe year is 2E 582, but I am unsure of the precise date. I've lost track, given the gravity of the monumental task that is before us. After reading the previous entries in this chronicle, I felt it necessary to offer my side of the story, so that I am not misrepresented by future historians.nnWe Tharns have held positions of power throughout Cyrodiil since the days of the Potentate. We are prized for our loyalty to the Empire, our deft political machinations, and our ruthless subjugation or elimination of dissenters within Imperial territories. What we do is grim work, but it is necessary if the Empire is to endure.nnDo I sound boastful and egotistical? Perhaps I am. But I shall put these words to paper so that you, the reader, might understand my views and my actions and their place in the long view of history. nnFor nearly thirty years I advised the savage men of the Reach, from Durcorach to Leovic, as their long, brutish dynasty ravaged the Empire. They lasted longer than many of the would-be conquerors that came before them, but their alien nature and low heritage made them unfit to stand in the presence of the true-blooded sons of Colovia or Nibenay. Their most grave insult came when Leovic, youngest of their line, sought the hand of my sixteenth daughter, Clivia, in marraige, that she might rule with him as Empress. Like his grandfather before him, who married Veraxia Tharn, Leovic hoped that our family's connections and pure Nibenese bloodline would somehow legitimize his claim to the Ruby Throne. It was an exercise in futility, and it exasperated me to no end.nnSo, when Varen Aquilarios, the son of a Colovian Duke and a powerful military leader in his own right, contacted me in secret and sought my assistance to depose those foul strangers from the north, I eagerly agreed. The war was long and bloody, but armed with my knowledge of the Imperial City, Varen eventually led his army of rebels to the palace gates. Varen drove his sword into Leovic's black-blooded heart and watched him die, choking on his own life blood, at the foot of the Ruby Throne, and immediately declared himself to be Emperor. For my loyalty and assistance, he agreed to take my daughter Clivia as his bride. nnAfter Varen's betrayal at Mannimarco's hand, it pained me to hand the reins of the Empire over to another outlander, but The King of Worms is a dangerous enemy. To insure the dominance of necromancy over all other forms of magic, Mannimarco immediately cast the Mages Guild out of the Imperial City, then had all remaining dissenters arrested as enemies of the state. I did not wish for my name to appear on that very long list—which only grew shorter when the executions began—so I pledged my loyalty. In return, I was granted stewardship of the Imperial City. My daughter Clivia, still the Empress Regent, became the titular ruler of the Empire. But Mannimarco remained the power behind the throne.nnOf course, Mannimarco turned on me the moment my usefulness was expended. I was marginalized and cloistered away in a tower of bones, and my daughter was turned against me, lured by Mannimarco's promise to teach her the dark arts that would give her mastery over life and death. nnBut know this, dear reader. I will take the Empire back. I will restore order out of chaos. That is my only ambition, and my ultimate desire. I will strike down any who stand in my way with all the fires of Daedric sorcery I can command, and those who dare to thwart me shall be damned to the pits of Oblivion for all eternity.",""

"21337012-0-3051","By Erisa Moorcroft, Scholar, Comparative Religious StudiesnnI have never found it difficult to get an Orc to talk about his or her beliefs when it comes to religion and the afterlife. As each Orc clan and stronghold has a rich and vibrant oral tradition, this should come as no surprise. What did surprise me was how hard it was to form a coherent picture, as no two oral traditions agreed on even the most basic of concepts.nnIn this time of conflicting faiths vying for the Orcish soul, I found many of the tales I heard to be both extremely moving and extremely disturbing at the same time. Furthermore, I have been unable to locate a single tome related to the topic, or find a reference in any other books on related subjects. The only way to learn about the Orcish concept of life after death or a place of reward or punishment in a world beyond was by asking the right questions and listening to the various oral traditions. For after much research and countless interviews, I finally uncovered the Orc equivalent to the tales of the Far Shores and Sovngarde. Indeed, it was the only thing that the various oral traditions seemed to agree upon. And through them, I have discovered the Ashen Forge.nnFor the Orcs that revere Malacath, the afterlife promises rewards of immortality, abundant food and drink, and constant battle deep within the Ashen Forge. The Ashen Forge represents the culmination of the three constant truths of life among the Orc clans: the stronghold, the grudge, and the Code of Malacath. Let me explain each of these concepts and discuss how they relate to the Orc afterlife so that the meaning becomes clear (or at least as clear as each different stronghold attempts to make it). What follows is my best attempt to merge the divergent and sometimes conflicting tales into a single narrative.nnThe Ashen Forge sits at the center of Malacath's own stronghold in the Ashpit. According to some scholars, Malacath's plane of Oblivion consists of nothing but dust and smoke and ash. But his followers believe that the eternal emptiness contains all the things they hold dear and deem necessary to enhance their immortal existence. As the ultimate expression of the Orc stronghold, Malacath's Ashpit bastion stretches endlessly across the planes, extending even behind the stars to Aetherius, granting access to every worthy Orc who crosses from this life into the next. In Malacath's stronghold, every Orc is a chief, every chief has a thousand wives, and every wife has a thousand slaves to cater to their every need. The stronghold's walls rise one hundred feet into the smoky sky, constructed of polished steel and worked iron. Inside the walls, stone keeps, iron towers, and massive longhouses surround the central square that houses the Ashen Forge.nnThe Ashen Forge fills the endless space within Malacath's smithy, a massive hearth that burns with a fire said to be hotter than the sun. The thing that keeps this fire alive is the adherence by the Orcs of Tamriel to the Code of Malacath, but more on that later. Within this fire, every Orc must undergo the ritual of tempering when first they cross from this life to the next. They are thrust into the coals so that every grudge that he or she carried into the afterlife can be heated, melted, and eventually forged into the next generation of mortal Orcs. With the grudges of Tamriel tempered and returned to the mortal world, the immortal Orcs are now free to begin collecting a new set of grudges related to their new existence. Some particularly memorable grudges can also be hammered and worked into weapons or armor of legendary stature upon the Ashen Anvil, the gigantic work bench that stands beside the Ashen Forge.nnThe heat that fires the Ashen Forge comes from the burning, white-hot coals that are, according to the Orc lore-masters who would talk to me, the literal manifestation of the bloody Code of Malacath. They believe that the code fuels the fires of emptiness, betrayal, and broken promises, imbuing every newly forged Orc with a foundation of grievances and resentments that will take them far in the mortal world. The hope is that every generation will be better than the next thanks to the efforts of the generation before it and its ability to adhere to and follow the Code of Malacath.nnStill, Malacath's faithful believe that they will be rewarded with immortality, nourishment, and constant battle deep within the Ashen Forge. A life-everlasting filled with endless days of warfare, endless nights of fine food and drink, and ongoing opportunities to prove their toughness and demonstrate the quality of their steel.nnFascinating, really, especially when contrasted against the beliefs of Trinimac's followers. Unlike the oral traditions of Malacath that twist and grow with each telling at every different stronghold, the traditions of Trinimac's faithful was surprisingly consistent and they were happy to share them with me. High Priestess Solgra, especially, was extremely helpful in the preparation of this report. When a follower of Trinimac dies, she explained, he or she ascends to Aetherius to join with their ancestors. It seems that the afterlife for Trinimac's faithful also consists of endless war and celebrations, but with a greater emphasis on once again spending time with family members who came before you. In the end, I guess I found the Trinimac version to be somewhat tame when compared to the more savage and visceral beliefs of Malacath's faithful.",""

My goal with this text is sharing my findings and conclusions based on eighty years spent studying their unique architectural remains.nnThe Migration of the Deep Elves from their ancestral Dwemereth, now Morrowind, is a generally accepted fact. Recorded history supports this, specifically mentioning the Rourken Clan's refusal to join King Dumac in the forming of the First Council and their subsequent exodus to Hammerfell. The architectural premise is also sound, as the building habits of the Dwarves adapted and changed, albeit slowly and in subtle ways, over time and land. I propose that some of these differences are stylistic as well as practical.nnTraditional viewpoints suggest that the Vvardenfell Dwemer were the most prolific of their kind. Based on my excavations throughout Skyrim, Morrowind, and High Rock, I am not sure that this is the case. While Vvardenfell is almost cluttered with Dwarven ruins poking through the surface of the landscape, the construction of those ruins is fundamentally different from the majority of what I've observed elsewhere.nnFurthermore, as we delve into Vvardenfell ruins, we notice that their internal structure is quite different. While major civic and operational chambers are found near the surface in a Vvardenfell Ruin, that is not typically the case on the mainland. Minor passageways and storehouse rooms are near the surface, but more important locations do not occur until we explore much deeper.nnBecause such major locations are well-hidden in Dwemer Ruins outside of Morrowind, many scholars believed they were in fact not present in ruins outside that province. This premature conclusion has led some to believe such sites to be mere outposts. My research has shown this not to be the case.nnA few theories may explain this difference. Perhaps clan architects simply had their own styles and preferences when it came to civic planning. This seems only somewhat likely, as Dwarven techniques were based on empirical study, and there was likely little room for creative interpretation when it came to building technique. Geological makeup of the terrain almost certainly played a role, especially in a region like Northern Skyrim, where the ground near the surface is very rocky and often frozen, as opposed to the volcanic substratum common in Vvardenfell or the ubiquitous aquifers found in Hammerfell. It's possible that Dwarven architects in the North were not able to excavate larger structures until reaching more pliable strata.nnThis scholar would like to suggest, however, that many structures west of Morrowind were built after 1E 420. When the Clan Rourken left Vvardenfell, it seems evident that several clans broke off to create their own settlements, choosing to live in greater isolation than their Eastern brethren. This theory is particularly fascinating, because it leads me to believe that Dwarven architects may have developed even more elaborate methods of hiding their strongholds over time.nnThis opens the distinct possibility that undisturbed Dwarven archaeological sites exist throughout Tamriel, even in southern areas like Cyrodiil or Black Marsh, where Dwarves are not believed to have ever had a significant presence.

The family may, as they claim, be as old as the First Era itself: as house historians like to point out, there is a ""Tharanus Ye Redde-Hand"" mentioned in the Tamrilean Tractates of 1E 200. In those days before Alessia's Slave Rebellion, this proto-Tharn was apparently a slave overseer employed by the Ayleid Elves of Fanacas, a mining hold in the hills north of modern-day Cheydinhal. Based upon the fact that the Ayleids were known to have kept business records in red ink, the Tharn historians posit that this ""Redde-Hand"" was probably literate and employed in some clerical capacity. To be thorough, I will mention Lady Euphemia Glaber's theory that identified this Tharanus with the notorious ""Tharhan the Mutilant"" of the Gradual Massacre in 1E 227, but this was completely disproved by the text of the ""Scroll of Precursor Saints"" discovered in the vaults below the White-Gold Tower by Chancellor Abnur Tharn in 2E 541.nnHouse tradition holds that the Tharn family was active in St. Alessia's slave uprising, with one Vilius Tharn serving Pelinal Whitestrake as ""Blade-Serrator and Master of the Abbatoir."" But the next Tharn who can definitely be identified in the historical record is Fervidius Tharn of the Alessian Order, who was Arch-Prelate of the Maruhkati Selective from 1E 1188 until his death (exact date indeterminate). Fervidius is best-remembered today as the author of the ""Sermons Denouncing the Seventeen Leniencies.""nnNoble Tharn captains led mercenary companies that fought on both sides in the War of Righteousness in the 2300s, and when the dust settled General Turpis ""Volte-Face"" Tharn was in possession of the broad holdings that the family today calls home. Taking the title Earl of Outer Cheydinhal, Turpis married a niece of Admiral Bendu Olo and set about fathering numerous descendants. nnSeveral generations of Tharns served nobly and well during the Reman Empire, including Regulus Tharn, who revived the tradition of Imperial Battlemages, and Excoraeus Tharn, Emperor Kastav's Minister of Punition.nnWhich brings us to the members of the Tharn family of our own, current day. First and foremost, of course, is the head of the house and longtime Chancellor of the Elder Council, Abnur Tharn. Through times of trouble and the change of emperors, the Chancellor has always been there to provide the continuity and consistency our Imperial civilization needs. nnSecond only out of respect for her elder is Her Majesty Clivia Tharn, Empress Regent of Cyrodiil, and daughter of Abnur Tharn by his seventh wife, Pulasia. Empress Clivia, it need hardly be said, is the widow of two emperors, having been the consort of both Leovic and Varen. nnScarcely less powerful is the Chancellor's younger half-sister, Euraxia Tharn, who has been Queen of Rimmen since the Frostfall Coup in 2E 576. And what would social events in the Imperial City be like without the presence of her son, the droll and charming Javad Tharn? nnTruly, House Tharn has come to epitomize the modern Nibenese nobility. We can only hope that they will continue to be with us through the future, whatever it may bring. nn(Note: Effusive enough? Also, forgot to work in Magus-General Septima.

"21337012-0-3009","By Zephrine Frey, Chronicler of WayrestnnLet's talk about the wives of King Kurog of Wrothgar. He began collecting wives shortly after he returned to Wrothgar and defeated Bolazgar to become chief of his clan. His first selections were purely political, taking wives to shore up his alliances with other clans. It was about this time that I became aware of Kurog's mother, Alga. He had mentioned her a few times in conversations we had over the years, but she never seemed to be a major influence in his life. At least, she wasn't prominent in his life as a mercenary.nnNow that Kurog was chief of his clan, his mother had stepped in to fill a need he never knew he had. She took the title of Grand Forge-Mother and immediately set out to negotiate marriages for her son. For those of you not intimately familiar with Orc traditions, you must understand that the only male in a clan allowed to take wives is the chief. He functions sort of like the primary male in a pride of lions, lording over all until someone younger and stronger comes along to take his crown. Just as Kurog did with Bolazgar. The chief's wives become the highest-ranking people in the stronghold, taking charge of important clan functions while the chief supervises everything from a distance. The only activity the chief personally takes charge of is war, whether leading raids or actually taking his clan into battle against a hated enemy.nnThe most-influential and powerful of the chief's wives is the hunt-wife, and this was the first marriage that Alga worked to secure. Rumors abound that more than a dozen young hopefuls were vying for the position, but Alga and Kurog had a specific goal in mind. In the end, a powerful daughter from the Shatul clan, famed hunters of the Wrothgar highlands, was selected to solidify the alliance between the clans. Noroga pledged her loyalty, taking her place as Kurog's hunt-wife.nnWhen it came time to find Kurog a forge-wife to oversee blacksmithing and mining for the clan, Alga looked no further than the famed weapon and armor smiths of the Morkul clan. The obvious choice was the Morkul chief's eldest daughter, an Orc maiden named Ashaka. But Alga was more interested in the younger Tugha, who had traveled abroad for two years to study with the blacksmiths of western Skyrim. Her experiences, modern attitudes, and obvious intelligence won her the position of forge-wife for Kurog and his clan.nnIf there was a requirement other than bringing another powerful clan under Kurog's banner, the role of hearth-wife demanded not only a brilliant household administrator but a talent for cooking that went beyond the usual skills of a mountain-bear hash-slinger. Kurog, as I've mentioned in previous volumes of this chronicle, relished food with a passion. Between fighting and eating, I'd be hard-pressed to determine which activity Kurog enjoyed more. Be that as it may, it would take years to find someone of Orcish grace and exceptional talent to fill this marital role. A great competition was eventually staged while Kurog was off aiding King Emeric at the end of Ranser's War. nnWhile Kurog was away, at least according to my sources, Forge-Mother Alga invited the most eligible Orc maidens from the most powerful clans not yet allied with Kurog to compete for the title of hearth-wife. She made them engage in a culinary battle that was as violent and bloody as any skirmish Kurog himself had ever undertaken. The women had to track, kill, and clean their own ingredients. They had to fight each other to secure spices from distant lands. And then they had to present their finished meals before time ran out. Alga and Kurog's first wives, Noroga and Tugha, would judge the worth of each contestant's offering. Barazal of Clan Murtag won the day, as much for her physical strength (it is said she killed a mountain bear with her bare hands) as her deft use of delicate spices. nnKurog has many and varied lesser wives, most of who I have no real knowledge of, as they work behind the scenes and rarely made their presence known. Two, however, are always at Kurog's side. These are his protectors, the shield-wives. Two powerful fighters currently fill these roles in Kurog's household, the warrior-sisters Oshgatha and Razbela. The sisters are as loyal to each other as they are to the king, ready to lay down their lives to defend him should the need arise. Even Noroga and Tugha remain on best behavior when the shield-wives are present.nnNote: Though each marriage secured Kurog a certain degree of cooperation from the various clans, I should point out that since Kurog took the title of king, some of the clan chiefs who joined with Kurog by virtue of his marriage to their daughters have had a change of heart. While these chiefs won't openly oppose Kurog due to the marriage alliance, they have yet to publicly accept him as king of the Orcs. This, as you can probably guess, makes Kurog extremely unhappy.",""

"21337012-0-3197","From ""Secrets of an Orc City""nBy Grilbar the ArchitectnnWhen next the Orcs decided to rebuild the city of Orsinium, they determined to create a series of tunnels beneath the streets that would serve as an escape route should the city ever again fall under siege. These tunnels still exist in the current day, with the newest stones of Orsinium being laid atop their foundation.nnAs the king's workers continue to build the city, some of the tunnels have been sealed off or even collapsed.

Let's look at these clans and the symbols that identified them.nnClan Bragosh, the Hammer ClannKnown for their smithing skills, this clan created specialized armor and weapons and was known as a trader of goods and supplies. Evidence suggests the clan was eventually absorbed by the Morkul clan.nnClan Pandrum, the Fire ClannA clan rumored to be filled with primitive healers and shamans, they supposedly controlled fire, using it as both a weapon and a tool to take care of a variety of tasks. They seem to have disappeared from history after the second siege of Orsinium.nnClan Enclave, the Star ClannNot much is known about this mysterious clan, other than they provided aid to other clans for their own purposes. Rumors persist that the clan still exists somewhere deep in the Wrothgar wilderness.nnClan Luccin, the Wolf ClannThis clan was known for conducting effective and terrorizing raids during the night. They were adept at moving through darkness and often took their enemies completely by surprise. Some believe that the clan was eventually absorbed by the Shatul clan.nnClan Murtag, the Rock ClannOne of the oldest clans still in existence to the current day, this clan makes its home in the mountains of Wrothgar, carving dwellings deep within the very rock itself.nnClan Ruskahr, the Owl ClannA clan of highly skilled archers, they were known for their impressive tracking and hunting skills.

"21337012-0-3210","An Informal StudynBy Folms SelethnnWhat is the fascination the typical Orc has with his (or her) own tusks? I swear, if they aren't constantly polishing or sharpening the damn things, they're studying them in whatever reflective surface is at hand or looking longingly at the tusks of their neighbors. And when they're not doing these things, they're talking about their tusks like they were royal heirlooms or ancient relics that were almost magical in nature. Let me tell you, it's enough to drive this Dark Elf a bit mad!nnWhile I supposed it would be rude to just come right out and ask an Orc about this obsession with all things tusk related, I decided that making a study of how the word and concept of the tusk was used in everyday Orc speech could help me reach some level of understanding. The first Orc I approached about the subject, a young female who I'll call ""Orcah,"" made an angry face—at least, I think it was angry; I find it difficult to tell the difference when it comes to the countenance of the average Orc—and told me in an angry voice to ""tusk off!""nnWhat an odd expression, I thought. ""Tusk off."" Simple, declarative. It means almost nothing, but as it emerged from Orcah's mouth, I knew exactly what she wanted me to do. I departed quickly, making my apologies in great haste even as she was reaching for the axe hanging at her side.nnThis got me to thinking about other Orcish expressions that contained the ubiquitous word. For example, ""By Malacath's tusk!"" This seems to be an all-purpose exclamation that substitutes the proper noun with any of a multitude of famous or infamous Orcs. I've heard Orcs swear by the tusks of Malacath, Trinimac, Kurog, Bazrag, Forge-Mother Alga, Urtho the Flatulent, and even hearth-mothers and ancient ancestors that no one but the Orc making the exclamation even remembers. And for variety, the forsworn tusks might be chipped, cracked, broken, missing, pierced, or any of a myriad of shades and colors. nnAnother expression I hear over and over in the Orsinium taverns, ""Better than a kick in the tusks,"" seems to imply that one unpleasant experience is somewhat less agreeable than another unpleasant experience. When one Orc says to another, ""I heard you fell into a pond full of leeches,"" her companion exclaims, ""Yeah, but it was better than a kick in the tusks,"" I can only conclude that no matter how horrible an ordeal an Orc suffers, there could always be something worse. I suppose that an Orc's tusks are extremely sensitive and a kick must instill in them unbearable pain. Or, it's just something to say and you can't really infer anything deeper from the conversation. Orcs can be so confusing.nnBut this is just the tip of the tusk, as it were. Spend a few hours in an Orc tavern and you'll hear all kinds of expressions involving tusks. ""Tusk you!"" ""Who gives a tusk?"" ""You tusking idiot!"" ""What the tusk?"" ""Stop tusking around!"" ""Tusk me!"" And perhaps my favorite, ""Go tusk yourself,"" which at first glance seems to be an impossible request, but I've seen what an Orc tusk can do to flesh and blood. An Orc must really dislike the person he or she offers this fierce suggestion to.nnI decided to make one more attempt to get an Orc to discuss the topic of tusks with me. This time I chose a striking young female who was seated by herself in a dark corner, making her way to the bottom of a bottle of Orsinium pink zinfandel. I asked if she'd be willing to talk about the many uses for the word ""tusk"" in the Orcish vocabulary. nn""Tusk no!"" she told me in no uncertain terms. Nevertheless, I pressed the issue. nn""Are you tusking kidding me?"" she asked. When I assured her I wasn't ""tusking kidding her,"" she balled up her fist and knocked me on my arse.nn""Tusk!"" I exclaimed. And I finally understood the true meaning of the word.",""

"21337012-0-3212","Gull-koo loves her briar hearts! She's an interesting old bird, that hagraven. Since coming to the old Breton fort, my job among the Winterborn has been to assist Gull-koo, doing whatever the hagraven needs in order to make sure the briar hearts grow and thrive. Strange things, those briar hearts. Kind of like large fruits, but also kind of like the heart of some large animal. Or man.nnToday I got to see the process up close. It starts with a corpse. The Winterborn prefer to use the corpse of an enemy, but the hagravens have no such compunctions, Any corpse will serve their purposes, whether an Orc, Winterborn, or even a harpy. Once a corpse is procured, it is purified in a strange ritual of the hagraven's own devising and place in a specially prepared plot of soil. Then, with great reverence and fanfare, the hagraven adds the briar heart seed to the planted body.nnSpells and blood serve to feed and water the macabre garden, and soon the first sprouts begin to bloom from the corpse. The sprouts quickly grow into saplings, which in turn grow into small trees. These small trees connect through a system of roots back to the large tree the hagravens and tree tenders care for in one of the fort's courtyards. I believe that the sapling trees contribute to the health and overall power of the large tree, but my questions on the subject were ignored by Gull-koo and the other hagravens.nnMeanwhile, briar heart fruit blooms on the saplings and the large tree alike, beating a haunting cascade that echoes throughout the fortress. Once the fruit ripens, it is ready to be transplanted. And that's where our own warriors come into the picture. In most cases, when a Winterborn warrior falls in battle, a hagraven can bless the warrior with a ripe briar heart. The magical process plunges the briar heart into the fallen warrior and returns the warrior to life, granting him or her additional strength and fortitude as befits a briar-heart warrior.nnNow, I haven't yet been privy to the process, but I believe there's also a way to implant the briar hearts into living warriors. I've seen the cages where some of our most-powerful and loyal warriors have gone to meditate and prepare themselves for elevation to briar-heart warrior status. Perhaps, if Gull-koo agrees, they'll allow me to accept such an honor. I'll let you know how it turns out.nnYour sister, writing from Frostbreak Fortress",""

I listened to my clan chief. I tried to live by the Grudge and the Broken Promise. And then I had a revelation. I heard the word of Trinimac and my life was completely changed.nnSo what happened? I was on my way to visit the city of Orsinium, taking a barrel of my clan's famous tree-stump ale to trade, when I was bodily assaulted by a gang of Vosh Rakh recruiters. Praise Trinimac's name! They wrestled me to the ground, pulled a sack over my head, and took me to some secret location. I don't mind admitting I was scared for my life!nnAfter what seemed like hours, one of the Vosh Rakh elders removed my hood. She said that she was going to show me the error of my old-fashioned thinking. That she was going to open my mind and make me more receptible to Trinimac's holy message. I won't go into too many details, but I will say that her methods included frequent beatings, endless repetition of key phrases, threats against my family, and a judicious amount of a vile-tasting beverage that she explained would help me better understand the words of Trinimac.nnWhen I finally relented and declared my devotion to Trinimac and the Vosh Rakh, the process only continued for another hour before the elder was convinced of my sincerity. Then I was given my mask and robes and welcomed into the fellowship of the Vosh Rakh. Praise Trinimac!nnNow? Now I'm a loyal member of the fellowship, one of Trinimac's sharp blades. I fight for the Vosh Rakh. I will die for the Vosh Rakh, if they ask me to. But here's a little secret—I don't want to be a Vosh Rakh!

"21337012-0-3194","I've spent a fair amount of time researching the wildlife of Tamriel, from the common (and fickle) mudcrab to the powerful and beastly wamasu of Argonia. When I was invited to Orsinium, I jumped at the chance to explore its untamed wilderness.nnBefore we even arrived at the city of Orsinium, my caravan was attacked by those filthy Winterborn. My protectors were either slain or fled into the hills, so I tried to follow. I soon found myself lost. In my panic, I fell into a small ravine. nnThat was the last I remember before waking up, surrounded by blue-furred giants. They seemed to take interest in my well-being. Either that, or they were keeping me alive so that could devour me later. Ogres, while technically of the Goblin-kin, are not known for their intelligence, but they are far smarter than most animals. As a rule, I do not study the intelligent races. Circumstances being what they were, I was intrigued enough to record what I was able to observe. nnFrom what I saw, the ogres of the Wrothgarian foothills are far more advanced than the crude brutes I've occasionally encountered near Wayrest. Several of them, elders I suppose, seemed to practice some sort of crude totemic magic that involved the manipulation of ice. One of them approached me and studied me with as much interest as I showed in them. That was when something amazing happened.nnMy leg was broken and bleeding from my fall, and I couldn't move. The elder raised his hand in the air and I braced for a strike. Instead, a beam of energy coursed into my leg, freezing it. I could feel the wound stitching together and the bone mending. The pain was excruciating, but I found it to be exhilarating at the same time. nnAs I stood up upon my mended leg, I heard grunts of panic and excitement from the ogres nearby. I thought I had frightened them, but there was a commotion from outside. The ogres, while not capable of conversing in the common speech, do grunt and vocalize. They all repeated the same thing. ""Urkazbur. Urkazbur!"" It was surreal. nnI exited the tent to find a scene of carnage. A larger, angrier ogre was fighting the other ogres. The large one had bony claws strapped to his arms. He slammed them into the ground. Ripples of ice shot out from the impact sites, slamming into the others and knocking them down. The ogre who had healed my leg tossed what appeared to be a glowing ball of snow at the larger one. When it hit him, he reared back and shouted. He gestured and the the snow around him rose up and formed into crude simulacrums and joined him in the fight. nnWhile the Orcs were distracted by all this violence, I escaped. Perhaps one day when I've recovered fully, I'll return to see what became of ""Urkazbur"" and his snow simulacrums.",""

"21337012-0-3225","A Discourse on Faith by Ugdorga, the King's ScribennFor generations, Orcs have believed in three constant truths: the stronghold, the grudge, and the fury of Malacath. But before Malacath, at least according to certain traditions and a few noted scholars, there was Trinimac. Today, the city of Orsinium reverberates with the intellectual debate and reverent faith of both sides of the argument: Who is the true god of the Orcs?nnFor traditionalists, there is no question. Malacath is lord and god. He personifies the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse. His portfolio includes conflict, battle, broken promises, and anguish. Everything an Orc feels concerning his or her place in the world comes from the Furious One. The Orcs see themselves as a people betrayed, and Malacath reinforces this belief. For Malacath, clans must stand powerful but alone in their ancestral strongholds. The strongest rules and weakness is cast out with extreme intolerance.nnClan chiefs such as Chief Bazrag, who oppose the idea of an Orsimer king, hold to the teachings of Malacath.nnFor the new Orsimer, Trinimac is the culmination of their dreams and desires. The warrior god personifies culture and civilization. He calls for unity, not discord; for strength, not malicious chaos. He stands for unifying the Orsimer. For elevating us above our baser nature and making us equal to the other races.nnKing Kurog and the Orsimer of Orsinium follow the teachings of Trinimac.",""

In my first day alone I have witnessed many wonders of which I never thought Orcs to be capable. I decided to document my experience before I return to the College.nnI am struck by the secretive nature of these Orcs. Even the entrances to their great forge are carefully concealed, invisible if one does not know their presence. As if that were not enough, some paths only seem to open for those of their own bloodline, or perhaps those who prove themselves in some way.

"21337012-0-3221","A Study of Death Rites of the People of TamrielnBy Chaplain Jorden, Priest of ArkaynnAs a devout follower of the god of burials and funeral rites, I have dedicated my life to the study of the ceremonies and rituals performed by the various races of Tamriel when it comes to the deaths of their leaders, family members, and loved ones. In this volume, I explore the death rites of the Orsimer—otherwise known as the Orcs of Wrothgar.nnPopular lore would have us believe that an Orc's remains lay where they fall. While there is a grain of truth in this concept, Orcs know as much about disease and decay as any of the other intelligent races. No one wants a rotting corpse left around to stink up the place, and rotting corpses attract all kinds of insects and predators. So, while the spot where an Orc dies is marked and considered almost sacred by his brethren, the body is not left in place for more than a few hours. During this time, friends and family come by to pay their last respects. Then the body is removed—to where, I cannot say.nnOrcs, for all their oral traditions, refuse to provide explanations or specifics to outsiders. I have had to make educated guesses based upon observations and the few conversations I've been able to engage in. But so far, no one will tell me what the Orcs do with the bodies of the dead.nn* * *nI discovered an ancient Orcish burial site, the mountain known as Sorrow. This snow-covered peak, full of dangerous creatures and deadly weather, served as a depository for dead Orcs for several generations, though the practice ended abruptly sometime in the past. Apparently, the mountain was reserved for only the bravest and strongest Orcs, who were required to climb as high as they could before death finally overtook them. These Orcs were left where they fell, but stones were piled atop their bodies to form protective cairns or unique constructions called wedge tombs.nnThis also appears to have some connection to the practice of marking any location where an Orc dies and falls with a sacred rock. They call the rocks ""tumnors,"" which I believe means ""death stones"" in the Orcish tongue.nn* * *nI finally found an old Orc female who was willing to share some of their death rituals with me. Specifically, she was willing to discuss the practice of ""beshkar-nor,"" the death-forge.nnApparently, what happens to the bodies of Orcs of great stature—leaders, heroes, and revered elders—is that they undergo a process known as the death-forge. The old Orc described the process in confusing terms. I'm not sure if the blood is drained from the body and saved for later use or if the entire body is burned and reduced to ash, and then the ash is saved. Either way, the saved remains wind up mixed into molten metal, allowing the revered Orc to become one with a powerful tool or weapon, usually a sword, hammer, or shield.nn* * *nSo, my quest to completely understand the complex funerary rites practiced by the Orcs of Wrothgar continues. I've learned so much, but I realize I haven't really learned anything at all. I know, as a general rule, the Orcs don't bury their dead—except when they do, such as on the mountain of Sorrow. I know that they mark the place where a powerful Orc died, but they probably don't actually leave the body there to rot and decay. And I learned that some portion of a dead Orc is saved to mix with a newly forged tool or weapon in a process known as the death-forge.nnI'll continue to probe and investigate, for I find these contradictory practices to be fascinating. I just hope I don't anger the wrong Orc and learn about their death rituals first hand. That wouldn't do at all.",""

"21337012-0-3204","Vosh ball has a long and fabled history, going back to the earliest days of the Orsimer people. As the Orcs gathered into clans, they developed the concept of ""courage"" ball. It started not as a sport or recreational pastime, but as a way to test the bravery and resilience of clan warriors.nnThe earliest forms of vosh ball utilized a heavy sphere made of wood or metal that was about the size of an Orc's head. The novice warrior to be tested stood on the far end of a paced off court, staring down a battery of veteran warriors, each armed with a vosh ball. The veterans would each toss their vosh ball in turn, hurling it with as much strength as they could muster. If the novice was still standing after the volley of heavy missiles subsided, he proved his courage and was promoted higher into the warrior ranks.nnAs time went on, the test became an organized sport, with teams competing for honor and recognition among the clans. The heavy metal ball was replaced with a heavy leather ball, and rules and regulations were formalized and agreed to among the participating clans.nnToday, no gathering of clans is complete without a rousing, multiple-day vosh ball contest. Fharun clan holds the current record for ongoing victories, winning the last seven ""series of the clans"" by wide margins. Chief Bazrag of Fharun, the Fharun's most valuable player, has a particularly nasty and powerful toss he affectionately refers to as ""the bone-breaker.""nnWhile the rules of vosh ball are constantly changing, the basic structure of the game remains the same. Two teams of six Orcs each, all armed with a sling of three vosh balls, competes to control the enclosed court by rendering their opponents unconscious by hurling the heavy spheres with all of their might. Beyond that, there are dozens of rules and regulations that non-Orcs find confusing and contradictory. No matter. Anyone who has ever witnessed the game played in all its glory comes away excited, breathless, and with a renewed understanding of the definition of courage.",""

"21337012-0-3220","There is a creature in the land of the Orcs that defies explanation. The chub loon has no purpose and little known history. However, it is delicious when cooked with moon-sugar glaze and citrus.nnI, Zabia-ko, and several companions sought to secure trade with the Orcs of Fharun Stronghold when we found ourselves on the wrong side of the negotiations. We had little choice but to run for our lives when the chief burned our ship and sent warriors after us. The cold and rocky coast overlooking the frigid Sea of Ghosts became our home for the night. The howling sea wind bit deep into our fur. Despite that, sleep eventually came in the dark of the night.nnAs the sun rose over the Druadach Mountains, a cacophony of honking sounds broke the rhythmic peace of the waves against the rocks. The others feared some unknown beast had come to eat us, but curiosity overcame this one, and she slipped out of her bedroll, grabbed her staff, and moved toward the coast to let her eyes decide if we should stay or flee. Of all the creatures that have passed before Zabia-ko's eyes, none are stranger than the stub-legged, waddling birds that swarmed the ice floes and rocks. They stood in groups, clumping for warmth, with their useless wings flapping at their sides. Their call, once frightening, sounded comical when I looked upon them.nnThe birds were nothing like anything in the old and well-worn wilderness guide I borrowed from the library back home. Escape through the Friendship Gate could wait. This was something new, and new things have value. At first we were very careful to gather a few of the creatures, but we soon learned that they were too stupid to flee from a Khajiit. They had no trouble fleeing from Orcs, though! Any proper prey should try to run away when Khajiit walk among them, but not these flightless birds. We scooped them up and made haste for the gate, lest the Fharun clan catch our scent and give chase.nnThis one's first stop in Wayrest was to the Mages Guild. A few pieces of gold gained me access to their natural history library, where a new edition of the wilderness guide was prominently displayed. It mentions the chub loon as an elusive creature that was not observed by earlier writers. How could such an obnoxious creature be overlooked?nnThis one spent several days and candle-lit nights going over every tome on the creatures and wildlife of Tamriel. Not a single mention of the chub loon exists before the beginning of the second era. How could that be? The very first mention is in a text on the horker, and it only says that they were moving in on the horker habitat, disrupting the food source. Could it be that, like the Nords and other men, they came from another land? Could the stupid birds have been brought here by travelers from Atmora? Could they have traversed the Sea of Ghosts on their own with only floating chunks of ice to carry them? In any case, no matter how they arrived, they secured a new habitat, flourishing on Wrothgar's rocky coast.",""

"55049764-0-9008","Ah, greetings, traveler! Hold a moment, won't you? I'm looking for a cave. It would be foul smelling, likely surrounded by scattered bones and such. Have you seen such a place?",""
"55049764-0-9104","A blood-kin chief? This better not be some ride-by-night glory grab. Don't cheapen what you've won for bragging rights.nnBut you don't need to hear it said. Uh, chief.",""

"55049764-0-9417","Thanks to the timely arrival of the Wood Elf, we were ready for those Vosh Rakh bastards. You should have seen their expressions when we started cutting them down to size. It was glorious!nnSo, are there more of these tuskless wonders out there?",""

"55049764-0-9427","We cannot let Kurog get away with this.nnWhether his vision for the Orsimer is right or not, there has to be a way to get there that doesn't require the deaths of all the chiefs.",""
"55049764-0-9389","King Bazrag's going to pay for any damages the inn sustained when the Orsimer soldier barged in. Even going to give us a break on our taxes for the help we provided.nnMaybe things didn't turn out so bad after all.",""
"55049764-0-9372","Doesn't matter who's chief. If we aren't prepared for the spring thaw, the echatere will drown beneath the snow.",""
"55049764-0-9436","I don't know what's going on, but it probably has something to do with that overly cheerful Wood Elf.nnI'm sure Solgra will clear up the situation in no time.",""
"55049764-0-9438","Not sure why you're waiting around this old tomb. Wasn't taking my friend's skull enough?nnI built Orsinium with my own two hands. I don't know how haunting works, but I'll figure it out.",""
"55049764-0-9470","I need a few moments to remember the Kurog I once called ""Blade-Brother."" To wash away thoughts of the chief-slayer and his hagraven of a mother.nnWe'll talk more back at the keep.",""
"55049764-0-9555","With that mechanical beast dead, perhaps Birkhu should dust off the cobwebs and start exploring again!nnThen again, the alcohol in this place is very, very good. Perhaps one more drink ….",""

"55049764-0-9536","Once I get back to my workshop, I'm certain I'll be able to use this data to overcome my earlier setbacks. That should convince Kireth I was right to not give up, yes? Yes!nnThis time I'll have a truly stable energy exchange … and much less fire.",""
"55049764-0-9485","I wish my crew back in Daggerfall could see me now! Here I am, sharing food and drink with the king of the Orsimer!",""
"55049764-0-9549","These … these laborers eat like locusts. Never seen the like. I have no doubt I'll need your services again soon.",""
"55049764-0-9534","Back from the Sanctum, eh? I hope you gave that grave-raiding skeever-stain a sound beating.nnThe company has already settled accounts with Thazeg. You should talk to him if you want your cut.",""
"55049764-0-9522","Make sure to check in with Sonolia once you've dealt with those beasts. She'll want to know that her clients have been freed.",""
"55049764-0-9567","Orsinium will ring with the sound of our forge-hammer! We'll show the other clans what a true smith can fashion.",""
"55049764-0-9584","Hey! You're the one who settled that business out on the coast? With the shipwreck? What a mess that was!",""
"55049764-0-9565","Have you had a chance to inspect the Morkul forge yet? I've seen more than a few masterpieces drawn from those coals. The Guild could use more weapons like that.",""
"55049764-0-9484","This is all kind of bittersweet. But I have good ale, good food, and good friends to help me through this.nnI couldn't ask for anything more!",""
"55049764-0-9580","Don't be a stranger! Come on back and have a relaxing soak in the baths sometime.nnIt would do you good. Nothing washes away the stress of the day like a warm bath!",""
"55049764-0-9526","They called my brother the Wild Boar. No king ever tamed him, and he fought for his own reasons. nnBut he fought here. For me … for all Orsinium. His sacrifice shouldn't be forgotten.",""
"55049764-0-9582","Let's continue this fascinating discussion in the dining hall downstairs. I'll meet you there after I make apologies to my guests.nnAnd you better have proof to substantiate these wild claims or I might just have you flayed for ruining my good mood.",""
"55049764-12-9411","Remember to check the list. We have very specific needs here at the House of Orsimer Glories, distinctive portions of history that we want to put on display.",""
"55049764-5-5464","What do you want? Wait, never mind. I don't want to know. I'm not taking on any fares today.",""
"55049764-0-9342","Do whatever it takes. The chiefs must attend the moot. I trust you won't fail me. When this is over, Wrothgar will finally be forged into a united kingdom!nnMeet me at my cornerclub after you finish. All this planning has given me a powerful thirst.",""

"55049764-0-9539","There aren't a lot of people with the patience to train a durzog, or the strength to survive the experience. But there's something about you …. If you ever get tired of wandering around stabbing things, you might give it a try.",""
"55049764-5-9039","Fascinating! I never imagined the control mechanism would fit inside so small a space!nnIt will take me some time to master this device, but with it I'm sure I can suppress the outer defenses and return the quarry to a relatively safe state.",""
"55049764-5-9356","I feel terrible about what happened to Unsulag.nnBut I'm as good as my word. I'll fight alongside you until we get out of this madhouse.",""

"55049764-3-9419","I think it's time to get out of here now. Who knows when the rest of the cult will come looking for us?",""

"55049764-3-9374","You don't understand the evidence. <<1>> is a follower of Boethiah. She killed <<2>>!nnSomeone should make her suffer.",""

"55049764-1-9373","Leave me to mourn my husband.",""
"55049764-1-9480","Bazrag the king. As much as I respect and trust Bazrag, the whole idea of another king fills me with a certain amount of dread.nnThat said, Trinimac wants a united Orsimer, so I guess this is really for the best. Funny, that's what Kurog wanted, too.",""
"55049764-1-9391","Thank you! You saved my Shalda!",""

"55049764-1-9426","You learn a lot about healing when you're King Kurog's shield-wife. Looks like my skills apply to outsiders as well.nnBut we've wasted enough time. You need to get moving.",""
"55049764-1-9371","I didn't want to get involved with <<1>>'s concerns. A lot of sharp edges to her.",""

"55049764-1-9417","Go tell Kurog what's happening in his own kingdom and don't leave his side until you make him listen. Do whatever you have to, but you have to convince him to postpone the moot.nnI'll catch up with you as soon as I can.",""
"55049764-8-9405","That's a relief. I really thought that might be the arena that would break you. But you did it!",""

"55049764-3-9475","I'm beginning to think you might actually triumph in all our arenas. That would be splendid! nnThough then we'd have to restock all the non-Daedric monsters. Bother.",""
"55049764-3-9373","I sense that Rogzesh has not seen the error of her ways.",""
"55049764-3-9438","<<1>>'s tomb was to remain buried under ice until a true hero of Wrothgar walked the land. Now you disturb the dust in her resting place.nnWhy are you here?",""
"55049764-3-3265","Now that you have a king's writ you should study your profession under your new master. It will be hard, no doubt about it. Stick to it and you might mean the difference between success and defeat in Cyrodiil!",""
"55049764-3-9007","Once my scouts return from the coast, I leave this Eight-forsaken place and return to Hammerfell. Hopefully a few weeks in the Alik'r will thaw out these old bones.",""

"55049764-3-9109","Some trackers can spot a snapped twig. I'm lucky to notice a broken tree.",""
"55049764-3-9110","Find the truffle patch and give me a whistle. I'll send <<1>> your way.",""
"55049764-10-9370","Now I know what roast horker feels like!nnThey kept stoking the fire, making it hotter and hotter. I was almost ready to agree to whatever they wanted. Almost.",""

"55049764-5-9441","Keep quiet—if my kinsmen see us together, they will kill us both.",""
"55049764-0-9007","Excellent work in Watcher's Hold. I'll let that oaf <<1>> know if I need any more help.",""

"55049764-0-9375","We'll honor their memory—their sacrifice. Shinji, Baloth, and all the noble heroes who gave their lives here. They shall never be forgotten.nnAnd on my honor, neither shall King Joile's treachery.",""
"55049764-0-9371","I don't think gold will ever satisfy <<1>>. When you lose someone you care that much about, it's like a hole in your heart.nnLike Scrabbler. What a good echatere … such an amazing crest. But he shouldn't have tried to headbutt a mammoth.",""
"55049764-0-9367","Don't worry. Chief Bazrag gave us his word, so I'll get him to the high priestess. We'll sneak into Orsinium and no one will even know we're there.nnWhen you reach the city, come find me. There's something not right here and it's making me nervous.",""
"55049764-0-9428","No matter what, you need to get to Solgra before Kurog's soldiers do. She might be our only way to get inside the moot.",""
"55049764-0-9471","On your way back, after you've delivered the letters, stop by the King's Cornerclub. Speak to the barkeep and get a bottle of Kurog's favorite ale.nnIt's foul stuff, but he loved it. We'll use it to drink to his memory at the service.",""
"55049764-0-9288","I've already traced the origins of one of the items to the time of the Dragon War. Isn't that exciting?nnAnd I've called upon an alchemist to help me run some tests to determine its composition and physical make up.",""
"55049764-0-9553","The wild sighs in relief. This is good, but I sense it is only a temporary respite. Even now, a corruption lurks on the horizon. We must stay vigilant.nnI'll stay here a while longer. With this bread. Can't sense a blight on an empty stomach!",""
"55049764-0-9492","You've done everything I could ever have asked of you, my friend, but your service has come to an end.nnThe king of the Orsimer thanks you for your help and orders you to get on with your life.",""

"55049764-12-9387","Thanks to your efforts, I have ingredients for everything but the main course.nnWe've come this far. If it's no trouble, I'd like you to procure what I need.",""
"55049764-12-9300","These statues should open the hidden door. It seems so obvious, but it isn't working for me.",""
"55049764-7-9039","Our paths cross again, thank the Eight! It's amazing how often good research leads to remarkable discoveries.nnSince we parted, I have come to the conclusion that this is an automated quarry. Like the Orc pit above, only much more sophisticated.",""
"55049764-7-9044","I love the smell of the siege camp. It smells warm and sweet. Makes me anticipate the battle to come.nnYou know what it smells like? It smells like muffins. Really soft, fresh muffins. Covered in bog-iron ale jam. Mmm. I love that smell.",""
"55049764-7-9293","High King Emeric relies upon my dear Sovelle. If she were here, she'd know what to do.",""

"55049764-7-9405","Well, so much for Valkyn Tephra.nnYou move more and more like my barons. I can almost envision them ….",""
"55049764-5-9044","I'm almost certain we can defeat Ice-Heart. Almost.",""

"55049764-3-9552","So you're the gallant adventurer who means to recover my books, hmm?nnWell, you won't find any of my missing pages in this inn … such as it is. There's barely enough erudition to fill a teacup in here. You should look outdoors.",""
"55049764-3-9536","Ah, there you are! You'll be on your way to Zthenganaz soon, yes? I'm sorry if I seem impatient. I'm just anxious to begin these new experiments in earnest. The last one was … explosive.nnDon't look at me like that. You aren't my sister!",""
"55049764-3-9555","This one needs more drink. Much more.",""

"55049764-0-9331","You have done a great service for Malacath and his followers, outsider. Know that the Agra Crun will remember your actions.nnNow, go. And may your next battle be glorious.",""
"55049764-0-9374","<<1>> fled rather than pay for her crime. I hope she's eaten by wild durzog. It would serve her right.",""
"55049764-0-9395","Does this look like a general store? That's my stuff you stole, I'll have you know.nnLousy thief.",""
"55049764-0-9399","My fellow aficionado of tankards—have you tried the shandy? Its bouquet is like tying yourself naked to a log, hurling yourself from a cliffside, and bouncing through a field of nettles.nnMost people think that's a warning. Most people are idiots.",""
"55049764-0-9418","There you are! You missed all the fun.",""
"55049764-0-9419","When I get to Orsinium, I'm going to find a strong drink and a hot meal. And I might just skip the meal.",""
"55049764-0-9425","Ah, outsider. You never cease to surprise me.nnI suppose your recent adventures were somewhat trying. Of course, sticking your tusks where they don't belong usually leads to trouble, doesn't it?",""
"55049764-0-9429","Bazrag says he has a plan.",""
"55049764-0-9435","Her death was quick, if that makes you feel any better.nnWhat in Malacath's name happened out there?",""
"55049764-0-9441","I'll return to my tribe. The hagravens will sense their search is hopeless.nnPerhaps we can finally go home.",""
"55049764-0-9481","I'm happy for my people, but I'm sad that we lost the temple. Malacath wins the day and Trinimac fades back into obscurity.nnNo! I won't let that happen! As long as I have the breath to speak, I'll spread the word of Trinimac! You'll see!",""
"55049764-0-9483","To Kurog's lifeless body, long may it rot!",""
"55049764-0-9491","Thank you for allowing me to attend the funeral. It was good to get to say goodbye to Kurog in my own way.nnBazrag said I could keep the cornerclub open. Even retain the current name. I just hope the new king stops in for drink every once in awhile.",""
"55049764-0-9524","Ah, there's my favorite werewolf slayer. Welcome back!nnSo, how about it? Do you have my pelts?",""
"55049764-0-9525","I'm here on behalf of the king. What are you doing here?nnActually, I don't care. Stay out of my way and we're good.",""
"55049764-0-9531","You there, we need help. Our caravan … they came out of nowhere and attacked us!nnThe Orcs … they need those supplies.",""
"55049764-0-9540","Even now, collections for a new <<1>> have begun. When we've raised the gold, I will ask <<2>> to commission another assault on Thukhozod's Sanctum. There are many more souls there that struggle for freedom.nnI hope you are available.",""
"55049764-0-9552","Nothing pleases me more than the return of my text. To think, the world could have been deprived of this brilliant dissertation—by ogres, no less! You've done all of Tamriel a tremendous service.",""
"55049764-0-9554","Wrothgar's people are safe from the Worm Cult, for now. But the threat will return—it always does. When it does, I am certain that you will rise to defeat it.",""
"55049764-0-9557","The caravans have started running again, thank the Eight. With any luck, the Riekr will go back to banging rocks together and sniffing each others' arses. Stay prepared, though. I'm afraid they may be too stupid to keep away for long.",""

"55049764-13-9387","I have a drink and an appetizer, but I need a few more dishes before I'm ready to enter the competition.",""
"55049764-13-9405","Well done, challenger. It's always a pleasure to see you in action. Such precision! Such consummate skill!",""
"55049764-1-8173","Best of luck to you. <<1>>'s sealed up tight, and by Azura's own hand. It'll take some doing to get in, never mind thwart Molag Bal, rescue <<2>>, and make your way back here.nnSay hello to <<3>> if she's still kicking, will you? It's been an age.",""
"55049764-1-9078","Thanks for rescuing my sister and the other hunters.nnBut tell me, were you able to acquire the Riekr chief's totem?",""
"55049764-1-9110","We should get back to Shatul. <<1>> needs the <<z:2>>.",""
"55049764-1-9288","Isn't this place grand! And they were happy to have a researcher of my caliber join their staff.nnFeel free to look around. We have some lovely displays coming together downstairs that show the width and breadth of Orsimer history.",""
"55049764-1-9329","You're the outsider who leaped into the bear's den to fight the Winterborn? Ulsha and the Wood Elf mentioned you.nnSurprised you didn't end up all bruised and bloody like the rest of these fools. This is our home, not an amusement for your pleasure!",""
"55049764-1-9330","You brought back my daughter, and she returns with the Hand of Morkul.nnNo chief can deny her, now!",""
"55049764-1-9331","I do not know you, yet you approach with great purpose. State your intentions and let Malacath judge your worth.",""
"55049764-1-9349","Those little savages left me for dead, but I managed to find my way out of there.nnFor a bunch of stupid Riekrs, this group was pretty organized.",""
"55049764-1-9395","How many times must I tell you? Leave. Me. Alone!",""
"55049764-1-9411","You've done it, haven't you? <<Cz:1>>—do you have it?",""
"55049764-1-9418","You go warn the king. Don't worry, I'll keep the high priestess safe. You can count on me.",""
"55049764-1-9419","When I get to Orsinium, I'm going to look for a hot meal and a strong drink.",""
"55049764-1-9425","I am so disappointed in you. I thought when you killed your friend, you did so for Trinimac and our cause. But it seems that it was just a means to an end for you.nnIt's good that I see you for what you truly are before I let this go much further.",""
"55049764-1-9431","The side door leads to the library. If there's an entrance to the tunnels anywhere in the temple, it will be somewhere in that chamber.nnAnd don't worry about Eveli. I'll do everything I can to ease her pain.",""
"55049764-1-9435","The final battle approaches like the wind before a storm. We either stop Kurog now or we die trying.nnStrike true and strike often, my friend. And make every strike count!",""
"55049764-1-9436","I don't know what's going on, but Solgra has a gentle heart.nnI'm sure this is all just a misunderstanding.",""
"55049764-1-9438","I always knew <<1>>'s rest would be interrupted. Doesn't mean I'm happy about it.nnWhat now?",""
"55049764-1-9441","I needed to see for myself. To watch you end it. To show Malacath we are not his playthings.",""
"55049764-1-9475","Your combat skills are quite impressive. If they are impressive enough, this could turn out to be very interesting. Very interesting indeed ….",""
"55049764-1-9479","Did you hear? I'm going to stay here and help King Bazrag!nnStill not sure what I'll be doing, but he mentioned forming an archery unit. I'll get my own squad! I'll have to think up a clever name. Something dashing!",""
"55049764-1-9481","Another king? Well, I suppose that makes sense. A united Orsimer is certainly stronger than isolated clans.nnI guess you could say Kurog got his wish after all.",""
"55049764-1-9483","Orcs and their kings. They're almost as bad as the Bretons and High Elves.nnSpatter mud on their clothes and they need to have them cleaned, just like the rest of us.",""
"55049764-1-9484","Bazrag let them crown him as king? I never saw that coming!",""
"55049764-1-9485","King Bazrag? I guess it has a sort of ring to it. I just hope he knows what he's getting into.",""
"55049764-1-9491","I wonder if Bazrag has any interest in a cornerclub. We wouldn't even need to change the name or anything.",""
"55049764-1-9526","I swore I'd never thank a Breton—not after what your king did to my home. But when I finally go to the Ashen Forge, I'll tell Malacath a tale of the Dragon who slew the Beast.nnThat's all you get.",""
"55049764-1-9539","Glad to see you back—and with only a few bite marks, too. I'll admit it, I'm impressed.nnAny luck in the Kennel?",""
"55049764-1-9549","You're back. From the smell, I'd say you were successful. Am I right?",""
"55049764-1-9553","You need not speak … I feel a great cleansing has occurred. The wild is free of corruption, for a time.nnActually, it might just be me. I had some really good bread and that always makes me sleepy. Were you successful?",""
"55049764-1-9580","I was hoping you'd come by. I made sure to wear my favorite fragrance so that the innkeeper's daughter would notice me.nnShe's a feisty one! She should come and soak with me sometime. Do her a world of good, it would.",""
"55049764-1-9582","We'll continue this discussion in the dining hall below. I can't wait to hear what proof you have to substantiate these wild claims.",""
"55049764-1-9584","Pull up a seat by the hearth, friend. I could use the company.",""
"55049764-14-9387","Still no sign of my assistant. Want to make some more coin? I prefer to work with people who finish the job.",""
"55049764-2-5020","""Maybe we should go upstairs so I can protect you."" Who even says that? He could have complimented my eyes! Or my … never mind.nnHe's one of Dhalen's thugs. No sign of the King, though. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.",""
"55049764-2-9007","Those fools in Watcher's Hold just refuse to give up! When the Lionguard arrives, we'll finish them off. But in the meantime, you need to keep them from heaping any more dishonor on High-King Emeric and the Covenant.",""
"55049764-2-9008","Arushna has been kind enough to capture a wild durzog for me to tame.nnDid you find the whistle?",""
"55049764-2-9044","We need to find a way inside the fort. Talk to Chief Urgdosh. They're working on a plan to get into Frostbreak Fortress.",""
"55049764-2-9070","Perhaps <<1>> is right about the changes in Orsinium. Time will tell whether she is an exception, or the first of many.",""
"55049764-2-9078","Murukh's probably the strongest in our party. He took the uninjured hunters and went after the Riekr. I think they headed toward the cave in the cliffside.",""
"55049764-2-9108","Hmm. You looked different from inside <<1>>'s helmet.",""
"55049764-2-9109","Messy, but necessary. He waved that thing around enough that anyone in Shatul will recognize it. A very distinctive tattoo.nnLet's head back to the chief's tent.",""
"55049764-2-9110","That's the <<z:1>>. Grab it so we can get back.",""
"55049764-2-9283","Welcome back. Let me guess. From that look on your face, Narsis Dren wasn't completely honest with us when I hired him.",""
"55049764-2-9288","I'm better at research than actual field work. I heard they're establishing a museum in Orsinium. Perhaps I'll go work there. I know they'll appreciate my skills more than Dren ever did!",""
"55049764-2-9318","You're alive! Finally something good comes out of this debacle. Too many priest died because of those fanatics. We removed their bodies, but if word of this gets out ….nnI need to know—did you find High Priestess Solgra? Is she safe?",""
"55049764-2-9357","The sooner we get out of here, the sooner I can report these mad cultists to the authorities.",""
"55049764-2-9370","Funny, when I was stuck behind that fire, all I could think about was getting back to Shornhelm with Raza.nnBut now I think I want to stay in Orsinium and really learn about my heritage.",""
"55049764-2-9374","I think it best if <<1>> and I stay with Shatul. We still have much to offer the clan.nnI hope she agrees with me.",""
"55049764-2-9378","High Priestess Solgra wants to talk to you. Better not keep the lying liar who lies waiting.",""
"55049764-2-9382","I didn't expect Wrothgar to be so harsh. Next time I won't be so eager to find a partner.",""
"55049764-2-9411","Good, good! You've done such a fantastic job filling these walls. The House of Orsimer Glories is finally worthy of its name!nnThere's just one final piece … if you don't mind braving the wilderness.",""
"55049764-2-9419","That was more of an adventure than I was expecting. I hope the rest of my journey doesn't turn out to be so eventful.",""
"55049764-2-9428","Get to the temple and help Eveli and Solgra. Then find the way into the moot.",""
"55049764-2-9430","Champion of Orsinium, it is an honor to meet you. May I bestow upon you Trinimac's blessing?",""
"55049764-2-9435","The final battle approaches like dusk before the dark. We either stop Kurog now or we die trying.nnStrike often and strike true, my friend. And make every strike count!",""
"55049764-2-9439","Greetings, friend. I have a request on behalf of the mighty King Kurog!",""
"55049764-2-9449","You bear the <<1>>. I knew, because as soon as I saw you, Malacath whispered that I should kill you where you stand.nnClearly a sign.",""
"55049764-2-9463","Appreciate your help. Grandfather deserves a tidy cairn.nnCareful. Most folks who go into <<1>> don't come back.",""
"55049764-2-9471","Ah, you're just in time. We finished clearing out the Vosh Rakh and the remaining chiefs are waiting for me to address them.nnBut, word of Kurog's death is spreading through the city like wildfire. I don't know how the people will react to the news.",""
"55049764-2-9481","May Trinimac watch over all those who have fallen and guide them to their next reward.",""
"55049764-2-9485","Never liked funerals, never will.",""
"55049764-2-9496","There's an ogre den in a nearby cave called ""<<1>>."" Grab anything ogre-created which has a natural look, feel, or smell.nnBring it all to the House of Orsimer Glories and I'll assemble my artwork!",""
"55049764-2-9524","Back again, eh? Well, the task remains the same. Cut the hides off those werewolves hiding in Argent Mine and slay their leader. I'll be here with your payment when it's done.",""
"55049764-2-9531","You there … we need help. Our caravan … they came out of nowhere. Attacked us, stole our cargo.nnThe Orcs need those supplies!",""
"55049764-2-9534","These people and their Dwarf-junk … honestly. Just leave the damned things where they are, am I right?",""
"55049764-2-9535","So you're the one seeking out my eggs? Excellent! I know I can count on you to get the job done right.nnJust be careful bringing them back. Eggs don't travel well.",""
"55049764-2-9536","Well, I can't say I'm surprised to see you back again! Even a death-trap like Zthenganaz proved no danger to you!nnDid you get the data I need?",""
"55049764-2-9539","So, you're going back into the Kennel for me? Good, good. Just make sure you don't end up as durzog food yourself.",""
"55049764-2-9540","I am glad to see you've taken up our cause once again, my friend. There are still many souls struggling under Thukhozod's heel. I know that you will do what's necessary to save them.",""
"55049764-2-9549","You're back? Good. I've got a whole mess of growling bellies waiting to be fed. Get out there and get hunting!",""
"55049764-2-9552","So, ready for another journey into the frontier? I've heard that some more of those brutish ogres were sighted doing … well, ghastly things with my book. That will not do.",""
"55049764-2-9553","The corruption stirs once again. Actually, that may be indigestion. One moment …. No, I was right, the corruption has returned. You must cleanse it before it has a chance to spread!",""
"55049764-2-9554","Dark clouds swirl overhead once more. I sense that Zandadunoz has returned. Are you prepared to send him back to Oblivion?",""
"55049764-2-9555","I knew Wrothgar was dangerous, but giant metal men, too? It is too much!",""
"55049764-2-9557","I'm afraid those Riekr are at it again. You ready to teach them another lesson in manners?",""
"55049764-2-9582","Ah, my favorite problem-handler has returned! Have you come to see what you accomplished? Thanks to you, the clan chiefs have gathered to hear what I have to say.nnThis is going to be a moot that all of Wrothgar won't soon forget!",""
"55049764-3-8071","You saved her. Thank you. I don't know what I'd … never mind.",""
"55049764-3-9044","That was invigorating! Nothing gets the blood pumping like killing a damned Reachmen ice wizard!",""
"55049764-3-9349","Don't know who you are, but at least you're not a short, hostile Riekr.",""
"55049764-3-9370","I can't thank you enough for helping us.",""
"55049764-3-9411","<<1>> was the largest bear ever seen in Wrothgar. Legends say that by taming the great beast, <<2>> bent all the bears of the land to his will.nnWhether true or not, he was all but invincible on <<1>>'s back.",""
"55049764-3-9428","I had a feeling I'd find you here. Kurog sealed the route to the moot, didn't he?nnDamn it! Most of my contacts have gone deep into hiding and we're no closer to saving the chiefs than we were when I scraped you up off the floor of the keep!",""
"55049764-3-9539","That old tusker Guruzug sent you, right? Just to be clear, you might lose a few fingers on this one. Nikolvara has wound her durzogs up tight. They're liable to bite anything that moves.",""
"55049764-4-9008","I'm headed to Bolgol Farm to warm up. It's not far. Just over the hill. After you test the whistle, you can find me there. Good luck!",""
"55049764-4-9036","You, there. If you're exploring the ruin, perhaps you could assist me.nnI find these unfortunate creatures quite fascinating, and would pay for evidence as to what brought them to their current state.",""
"55049764-4-9039","Go tell the forge-wife that the quarry is once again safe to work in. I'm sure that will make her happy.",""
"55049764-4-9044","I can see why my mother was so insistent about you. You're pretty good in a fight.nnI was going to do this by myself, but I'm damn glad I waited for you. I'd be a fool to challenge Ice-Heart without you.",""
"55049764-4-9070","You alone emerge from the Bloody Knoll. Did you pray to Malacath for your victory?","Emergi solo dal Poggio Insanguinato. Hai pregato Malacath per la tua vittoria?"
"55049764-4-9078","Ever met a Riekr? I hate those sneaky little bastards ….",""
"55049764-4-9288","Ah, another ancient barrow, another two-and-a-half gold pieces from my employer, Narsis Dren!nnBut you don't want to listen to my problems. Have a nice day.",""
"55049764-4-9356","The best way to hamper these fanatics is to eliminate the one who leads this den of deluded recruiters. We should kill Azhnura the Proselytizer.",""
"55049764-4-9357","If you really want to throw water on their fire, we should eliminate the one who leads this den of deluded cultists. We should kill Azhnura the Proselytizer.",""
"55049764-4-9368","I hope that Proselytizer person is dead. She said that I would come to Trinimac by fire or by ice. She also said I was as thick as a tree trunk, which isn't very nice.",""
"55049764-4-9370","I'm shaking, but that was kind of exciting!",""
"55049764-4-9371","Dark times ahead for Shatul. I can't contend for chief—it will take me away from the echatere.",""
"55049764-4-9373","Talk some sense into <<1>>. I can forgive her lashing out in grief, but <<2>> was my husband as well.nnIf she accuses me of his murder … to my face? I'll have to answer that.",""
"55049764-4-9374","<<1>> was strong and fair. He was a good chief … a good husband. How could he have died this way?nnIt seems so … small. Unworthy of the man he was.",""
"55049764-4-9375","The Order of Diagna shall fight beside my Knights of the Dragon. Truly, a good day. Wouldn't you agree … Tamahl, was it? Am I saying that correctly?",""
"55049764-4-9382","This is so much better than a cell. <<1>> thought her fur would never recover! Thank you for pitying this one's predicament.",""
"55049764-4-9387","Interesting taste, but nobody will eat a dish that smells like old greaves.",""
"55049764-4-9411","It's so nice to have a little help around here. Thanks for finding that historic treasure and setting it on its display.nnBut this is only the beginning! The wilds of Wrothgar are brimming with all sorts of important antiquities.",""
"55049764-4-9419","Have you ever heard of these Vosh Rakh maniacs before? I certainly haven't.",""
"55049764-4-9428","Get moving! The throne room is upstairs, remember?nnOnce Eveli and I get out of here, we'll try to rally some additional help. You can find us outside if you run into any problems.",""
"55049764-4-9429","About time you showed up!nnHey, where's Owayine? No, don't tell me. I already know.",""
"55049764-4-9449","Scholars uncovered the catacombs at what they call ""Honor's Rest."" Once inside, seek the <<1>>. Return it swiftly when you find it.",""
"55049764-4-9524","Great work with those werewolf pelts. They're selling like ice in the Alik'r!nnDo me a favor and don't stray too far. I'll need more of those skins before long, and you're someone I can trust.",""
"55049764-4-9534","Be careful around those durzogs. One of my mates thought he could train one as a watchdog. Got ornery one day and snapped his hand off like an apple on the branch. nnIt's a shame too. He was a damn fine lute player. My friend, I mean. Not the durzog.",""
"55049764-4-9535","I'd heard there were some exotic egg delicacies available here in the Morkul Clanhold, but I have been very disappointed so far.",""
"55049764-4-9540","I sometimes pray to Malacath for strength—but Malacath cannot give it. He only issues the challenge. The challenge to claim strength for ourselves.",""
"55049764-4-9549","I've had a rough day, outlander. Let me drink in peace, all right?",""
"55049764-4-9552","Please, no autographs. I'm quite busy writing another valuable treatise.nnHmm, well, I suppose my autograph would be important, too. Still, I am otherwise occupied.",""
"55049764-4-9553","The bread is delicious, no question. But real sustenance can only be found in the forest. When I consume the forest's bounty, I take in the wild.nnYou don't want to be here when the wild comes out, though. Trust me.",""
"55049764-4-9554","The future of Wrothgar is uncertain. I see dark clouds on the horizon. Do you hear the thunder?",""
"55049764-4-9557","Doesn't matter how great your city is if no one can get there. These roads are treacherous, friend. Be wary.",""
"55049764-5-9382","Ah, it's the one who stabbed me in the back with such little effort. If I didn't know better, I'd assume you belonged to the Dark Brotherhood.",""
"55049764-5-9387","You'll want to look for <<z:1>>, preferably untouched by any echatere. It's the subtle glue which will hold the ogre heart and intestines together.nnThere's … no actual glue. It's just an expression.",""
"55049764-5-9411","Just head downstairs and place the helmet in the proper display.nnWhen you're finished, come back and we can discuss your future involvement with the museum.",""
"55049764-6-9039","This is one of the most complex Dwemer devices I've ever encountered.nnTo reiterate, we need to strike the kinetic resonators to rotate the rings and align the lenses to the beams. If you run into trouble, just use that lever to reset the rings.",""

"55049764-6-9368","I hope they still have a job for me at the tavern in Orsinium. I should have been there days ago.",""
"55049764-6-9370","I've never had to race through a battle zone before. I'm scared to death, but it's kind of exhilarating.nnMust be my Orc blood. I wonder if by living in a big city I've denied my heritage for too long? I have to think about that.",""

"55049764-0-9607","Dwemer constructs are surprisingly loyal and affectionate, considering that they are machines and all.nnWe've more than doubled the efficiency of the quarry already. And worker safety is no longer an issue. I assume the chief will be quite pleased.",""
"55049764-0-9588","What in Trinimac's name is going on? Why did Kurog send soldiers after us?nnThey acted like we'd done something horrible. I didn't want to worry Eveli, but I was frightened for our lives! I'm just glad you arrived when you did.",""
"55049764-0-9601","Thanks to you, the Orsimer have a new king, and he's a good king. I owe you for helping my husband, outsider. You'll always have a friend in Orsinium, should you ever need one.",""

"55049764-0-9644","If you want to stay alive, I wouldn't try to get down into Old Hiradirge. The people who go down in there don't come back. Or, if they do, they're seriously changed.",""

"55049764-0-9708","Why shouldn't I call my guards right now?nnWhat are you going to tell me to convince me I shouldn't have you all thrown in the prisons to rot while I go on with my day?",""

"55049764-0-9672","This one didn't expect to go to a party tonight, but will be ready.",""
"55049764-0-9638","Talk to Elam for your first official contract. He's as dour as any Dark Elf, but he's got a good head on his shoulders and will make sure you're prepared.",""

"55049764-0-9694","Time to use our skills to find out the information we need and put a stop to all of this.",""
"55049764-0-9726","This one assures you that these goods have been acquired through only legitimate means.",""

"55049764-0-9699","Falorah's in Cosh's chambers getting ready. It's in the upper side of the manor, back room.nnIf you do find her, tell her I still say this is a bad idea.",""
"55049764-0-9633","Take some time to get to know your fellow brothers and sisters. When you're ready to take on some work, talk to Elam Terano. He'll have contracts for you.",""
"55049764-0-9695","I think you impressed Shalug. She actually didn't mention killing you once at dinner last night.",""

"55049764-0-9689","Ah, I wonder what they're serving for dinner?",""
"55049764-0-9721","This one hears nothing. Sees nothing. This one only sweeps.",""
"55049764-0-9687","I have heard of this place, but to see it with my own eyes. Truly spectacular.",""
"55049764-0-9719","Meet me at headquarters. I'll explain everything there.",""
"55049764-0-9623","Divines bless you, outsider. What brings you to our town?",""
"55049764-0-9634","I need to find out more about this Cosh person.",""
"55049764-0-9666","Did you have further questions?",""
"55049764-0-9698","You should not linger here long, friend. Take this one's advice—you want no part of what is coming. Be smart like Bakhum and leave this business to the Twilight Cantors.",""
"55049764-0-9609","I only need the basic repair kit, but the one on the cart says it's ""grand."" That must be a lot better.nnRight?",""
"55049764-0-9641","I saw Qamar strolling around a moment ago, pleased as a fat hog. He still hasn't figured it out.",""

"55049764-0-9690","Hmph. I've seen better.",""
"55049764-0-9722","We'll meet again, my friend. The queen's will is never done, and the queen's blades are always hungry.",""

"55049764-0-9618","I wish you better luck than I!",""
"55049764-0-9650","Well, we're off to work then. Don't be a stranger. Come check up on us.",""
"55049764-0-9714","There are lots of disguises that Nicholas probably wore, so maybe the Thieves Guild met him without knowing it.",""
"55049764-0-9616","This is… was, Silver-Claws warehouse. Iszreena is a conniver, but not that smart. No idea how she managed to take this over, but she surely had to have help.",""

"55049764-5-9661","I am an excellent thief, but I rarely, if ever, carry any sort of weapon. Unless you count my way with words as a weapon.",""

"55049764-5-9688","What are you doing? Start searching the room! There's got to be a way out of here!",""
"55049764-5-9722","You look a hearty sort. How would you like to strike a blow for queen and country?",""
"55049764-5-9621","After this is over, I owe you a drink.nnAndrya doesn't believe me about Bishop Ponticus or the order. We didn't part on the best of terms. She's convinced they're without sin. We'll change that.",""
"55049764-5-9697","I'll be right behind you.",""
"55049764-5-9481","I shall represent Trinimac and the temple at Kurog's funeral. The people need to see that we're not all Vosh Rakh fanatics.",""

"55049764-15-9534","You're looking for work, yeah? Good. We can use you. Folks around here have all kinds of problems that a good sell-sword can solve. These contracts are piling up and my crew is booked solid.nnSo what do you say? Want to get your hands dirty?",""
"55049764-37-9611","Come, come! Our goods are clearly lonely. Come and spend some time, and also money. Spend the money first.",""
"55049764-20-9611","This one has heard the bite is profitable, yes? A strange business, to be sure.",""
"55049764-3-9471","This last favor is of a more personal nature.nnI want to give Kurog a proper funeral, to honor him for the warrior and leader he was and not the crazed despot he turned out to be.",""
"55049764-3-9481","The temple has never been more full of joy and life! Thank you for saving the high priestess!nnBut where are my manners. Your Elf friend. She's still fighting to survive the wounds inflicted upon her. May Trinimac watch over her and make her well.",""
"55049764-3-9599","Unlike some of my fellow chiefs, I'm willing to listen to what Kurog has to say.nnWords of wisdom can come from the most unexpected places.",""
"55049764-3-9485","Are you a sight for sore eyes! What brings you to the arse end of Malacath's wasteland?nnNo, you don't have to answer that. I can guess why you're here. This is just the kind of place that attracts people like you. You can't help yourself.",""
"55049764-3-9492","Your name will never be forgotten by the Orsimer. We will talk of your deeds for generations to come!nnNow, we'll find a way for the clans to work together. To fulfill Kurog's original dream of a united and strong people. Orsinium will stand forever!",""
"55049764-3-9596","I rarely leave my own clan lands, but this moot intrigues me.nnI just hope Kurog's speech doesn't delay the feast we were promised. I love a good roast mammoth!",""

"55049764-3-9634","I can't wait here. It was foolish for me to come out to Hiradirge anyway. If the Lamp sees me, they'll be suspicious of anything that happens here.nnI'll see you back at the Thieves Guild. Good luck!",""

"55049764-1-9590","Have you seen any good game animals around? I haven't had any luck all day.",""
"55049764-1-9596","I just came for the celebratory feast.nnI'll say this for Kurog, his hearth-wife knows how to roast a tasty mammoth!",""
"55049764-1-9592","Hail the king! He's just what this city and the Orc people need. It's time for Trinimac to reign again!",""
"55049764-1-9601","My husband, the king. I'm not sure how I feel about that.nnI suppose I'll have to get used to it. It's not like he can refuse the throne now that he's accepted it. At least, I don't think he can.",""
"55049764-1-9597","I came to listen to Kurog, just like you asked. Don't blame me if I fall asleep, though.nnStill, it's nice to see how Orsinium has come along. The stone from our quarry truly makes this a remarkable city!",""
"55049764-1-9522","I hear you freed those hostages. Good work. Once we get them a new set of clothes and a hearty meal, they'll be ready to get to work.nnSonolia's been looking for you. You should go speak with her.",""
"55049764-1-9599","I'll listen to what Kurog has to say.nnUnlike some of my fellow clan chiefs, I'm willing to find wisdom in even the most unexpected places.",""
"55049764-1-9595","I love books! I wonder if they have any copies of Investigator Vale in here?nnAnyway, I'll look around over here.",""
"55049764-1-9437","Someday we'll build a proper forge at this site. I'll have more to do than watch icicles form on my nose.",""
"55049764-1-9656","Sorry, friend. Can't help you. Got a load of ingots to carry up from the docks and the tender lad I hired to do it fainted halfway up the hill.",""
"55049764-1-9618","Ah, curse this mortal body! I am too weak to do what must be done, or I'll never be able to return home!",""
"55049764-1-9699","Please excuse me, I'm busy with my other friend here. The one who likes what I like.",""
"55049764-1-9661","With all of us working to rescue Danni, I know we will succeed.",""
"55049764-1-9695","Ah, it's you again. Still interested in work?",""
"55049764-1-9640","Oh, to see the look on Qamar's face when he checks his stash and finds it empty! This one will be long from port when that happens, but victory tastes as rich as sweetcakes.",""
"55049764-1-9636","Ah, my friend, have I ever told you my philosophy of why we do what we do?nnIt involves the balance of how we value possessions. How an item that is lifeless, made of a shiny metal, can impact someone's life more than that of another living being.",""
"55049764-1-9645","Pleasant greetings to you, initiate.",""
"55049764-1-9679","Looks like you're all set for tonight. I'm going with you. Only problem is getting inside. You might pass with an invite fine, but the Iron Wheel know my face.",""
"55049764-1-9641","You want to work over Qamar, you'll find his stash in the cave outside Anvil. If you don't die on the way.",""
"55049764-1-9722","Nothing like a knife fight to get the blood pumping! How are you? Any wounds I should know about?",""
"55049764-1-9624","What can I help you with?",""
"55049764-1-9620","Now that you are an initiate in the Dark Brotherhood, it is time you met your brothers and sisters. They will be your new family, and the Sanctuary will become your home.",""
"55049764-1-9629","Foul words have consequences, heretic. You will face judgment.",""
"55049764-1-9663","So Danni let you know about the wedding? Good, that'll save me time on that.nnCosh is planning to seal the deal with his control on Abah's soon. Very soon. But I think I might know of a way for us to get inside.",""
"55049764-1-9616","Yet another n'wah wandering into my garden. What do you want?",""
"55049764-1-9706","I didn't see anything!",""

"55049764-1-9647","No admittance.",""
"55049764-1-9643","These dice offer little favor.",""

"55049764-1-9639","So you're the new recruit, huh? I'm Tanek. Welcome, I suppose.",""
"55049764-1-9720","I misjudged the strength of your will. Thank you for your aid in defeating the terror of Hrota Cave.",""
"55049764-1-9670","Thank you for helping. I'll be right behind you.",""
"55049764-1-9704","You grab me that bottle of wine so I'm not bored out of my mind, and I'll tell you whatever you want about Falorah. Deal?",""
"55049764-1-9666","We meet again.",""
"55049764-1-9700","Thank you. I'll do everything I can to help Quen. Even though her father is dead, I can tell her about his days in Abah's Landing.",""
"55049764-1-9709","I'm glad that's over with, but the dowry isn't here. Let's see if we can find some clue as to its location.",""
"55049764-1-9662","Listen, we got some intel on Cosh's next move. We might actually be able to stop him after all. You up for a job?",""
"55049764-1-9688","That woman stumbling around here keeps talking about her fancy locket she won somewhere. Bet you we swipe that off her and she realizes it, she'll raise some alarms and get some folks attention.",""
"55049764-1-9650","A few more days of grunk work, and we're off to Sentinel.",""
"55049764-1-9646","So you're the new initiate. Hm. You're cuter than the last one.",""
"55049764-1-9680","Sorry I left so suddenly. It was a lot to absorb. I suspected my father was dead, I guess. No one knew anything …nnThe ledger! Please tell me you brought it with you! I was so distracted …",""
"55049764-1-9723","Danni wants a word with you. Something's up.",""
"55049764-1-9685","Welcome, welcome! Are you here for the great Lord Cosh's wedding by chance?",""
"55049764-1-9634","I have to find out more about this Cosh person.",""
"55049764-1-9668","This is all just so regrettable. The Thieves Guild sent me to help Quen when we found out the Violet Lamp were targeting her. I'm glad we got you both out of there alive.",""
"55049764-1-9630","You're back and alive! That's better than most folk who I've tried this with before.",""
"55049764-1-9664","Talk with Silver for the details. He's the one who found out about the wedding.",""
"55049764-1-9673","You heard Silver. I want to keep our numbers low. Bringing the whole crew might get messy and we might get noticed. Keeping our numbers down will help us go unnoticed.",""
"55049764-1-9707","Velsa told me what happened at Locke's tailor shop. It's a shame we weren't able to rescue him, but this doesn't change our plans. We're heading to Malooc's Tomb when you're ready.",""

"55049764-8-9382","Thank you for your advice. I never knew how much I'd miss my home until I departed!",""
"55049764-8-9661","We need to make some plans. I wish Danni were here. She is very good at planning.",""
"55049764-8-9534","So did you find those weird eggs? What do they look like? Actually, you know what—forget I asked. nnThe company's already settled up with Nednor. You should go talk to him to get your slice. Good work.",""
"55049764-3-9522","It's done, yes? That machine is destroyed? Hope you didn't break a blade on that thing. Ugh. Dwarves.nnBirkhu's been asking after you. You should settle accounts with him before he passes out.",""
"55049764-3-9601","I'll see you at the funeral. I have a few preparations of my own to attend to before I return to the keep.",""
"55049764-3-9484","Tusk off! I've got no time for beggars or dishonest traders and I'm in the mood to throw someone into the river. So walk away before we find out if you can swim.",""
"55049764-3-9491","No sad faces. Not in here. This was Kurog's happy place, and that's how it's going to stay!nnTo Kurog! To Orsinium! May the city always remember the kind and gentle king who cared for his people. Everything else … that was his mother's fault.",""
"55049764-3-9482","I'm glad you're here. Saves me the trouble of finding you. Before I return to the Summerset Isles, I wanted to thank you for not killing me back at the Vosh Rakh temple.nnI appreciate that. I think I would have found death to be very boring.",""
"55049764-3-9435","Are you as mad about what happened as I am?nnWe need to use that outrage to bring Kurog down. If we can get to the moot, he's going to throw everything he has at us to slow us down.",""
"55049764-3-9480","I'm glad you're here.nnEveli has entered a deep sleep. I don't know when or if she'll come out of it. But I'll stay at her side, no matter how long it takes. I just hope that Trinimac hears my prayers.",""
"55049764-3-9649","My friend! You're looking well. Tell me, do you have any news?",""
"55049764-3-9688","That's Cosh, eh? He looks like a jerk.",""
"55049764-3-9650","You look satisfied, Did you find my fool brother a job?",""
"55049764-3-9648","Well met, Brother. I am Elam Terano. I provide assignments and instruction for new family members, so you'll be seeing a lot of me.",""
"55049764-3-9709","Now that you've flipped that switch, maybe we can use those ashes to reveal the path.Try spreading them.",""
"55049764-3-9616","I'll keep watch. Grab the ledger and then we'll get out of here. I've arranged a few distractions that should go off shortly.",""
"55049764-3-9697","I heard what you, and she, said. I think I understand.nnI've already lost my father. She's my only connection to him. Very well, I'll forgive her and help her keep her home.",""
"55049764-3-9694","We need to convince her that she's doing the wrong thing. We know enough now that she should believe us.",""
"55049764-3-9635","There is great unrest in Abah's Landing, my friend. It is best we discover why as quickly as possible.",""
"55049764-15-9611","Too proud to pay for a bite? We hear people sell these. Here is hoping you are not too poor — well, because… This one wants your money, yes?",""
"55049764-3-9041","Is this one of the outsiders who responded to my invitation?","È questo uno degli stranieri che ha risposto alla mia chiamata?"
"55049764-10-9044","I am Kurog, king of the Orsimer.",""
"55049764-10-9419","Who knew Wrothgar had a problem with crazed cultists? I certainly didn't!",""
"55049764-10-9356","My mother warned me. She said that Wrothgar was cold and dangerous and would be the death of me. I should have listened to her.",""
"55049764-10-9709","First thing to do is sneak past these Violet Lamps.",""
"55049764-10-9534","<<1>>'s been waiting for you. Talk to her and she can release your reward.",""

"55049764-5-9479","I need a few more moments to clear my head.nnI'll see you over at the keep before the funeral begins.",""
"55049764-5-9458","You are not worthy of Malacath's fury. Away with you!",""
"55049764-5-9709","All this to reach an old vase? I wonder what's inside?",""
"55049764-5-9650","So here we are again, inconvenienced by my brother's muddling. You must get quite tired of aiding us every time Raynor overtaxes himself.",""
"55049764-5-9649","With your support, I'm certain the ruffians here will see they were fools not to hire us immediately.nnHonestly, I'm rather overqualified for most of this work. But I'll do what is necessary.",""
"55049764-0-9387","Are you certain you don't want any?",""
"55049764-0-9626","Do not despair, friend! The Divines smile upon us, always. Lift your weary head and give praise.",""
"55049764-0-9656","When the lad's ready, send him up. I'll expect him to get started as soon as he's gathered whatever materials he needs.",""
"55049764-0-9665","I have no idea what happened back there, but we have to get out of here!",""
"55049764-0-9640","Once more, this one will have the wind in her fur and the sea air in her lungs. We cannot depart this cursed port soon enough.",""
"55049764-0-9649","Just a few more days of honest work and we're bound for Sentinel.",""
"55049764-0-9679","Head to the wedding and get inside. I'll be behind you. I just need to change into something more appropriate. Don't want to raise more suspicions by not being dressed up once I am inside.",""
"55049764-0-9624","You look like someone who might be interested in unusual goods.",""
"55049764-0-9620","Good. Then we part ways, for now. Each to our own duties, in the name of Sithis.nnI am most looking forward to seeing your progress. And once again, welcome to the family.",""
"55049764-0-9663","It's up to you how you get the invite, but those two are the only folks I'm aware of who got an invite.",""
"55049764-0-9706","Don't tell the lamps I told you what I saw. They'll murder me.",""
"55049764-0-9702","This ink spot looks to be in the shape of a handprint.",""
"55049764-0-9608","These Orcs have a great deal to teach us. The Mages Guild would be foolish to ignore them.nnMy advice is this—be polite. The Morkul Clan can be … mercurial.",""
"55049764-0-9647","Darkness engulfs the world.",""
"55049764-0-9686","What happened during the heist is still haunting my sleep, but I was tying to let go of it. But now I hear Nicholas never showed up in Sentinel. He escaped between here and the city.",""
"55049764-0-9720","This vampire and his disciples are vanquished, but more will emerge. More always emerge. When they step from the shadows, my blade will greet them.",""
"55049764-0-9631","Don't mind Velsa. She is rude to everyone.",""
"55049764-0-9627","No matter the weather or the trial at hand, I know Lord Akatosh will see me through. What about you, friend? Have you considered your place with the Divines?",""
"55049764-0-9709","So Nicholas knew how to avoid the traps and even knew of a secret exit we were unaware of. It sounds like he double-crossed us, but it was a mistake to leave his journal.nnLet's investigate his stash room and see if we can find out more.",""
"55049764-0-9688","When we get a chance, between all of this, we should grab a drink. Maybe a dance as well?",""
"55049764-0-9684","What? I had this dress laying around.",""
"55049764-0-9646","Back so soon, darling? I'd miss me too.",""
"55049764-0-9727","You will buy goods from Khajiit, yes? Good. This one lives to trade.",""
"55049764-0-9592","They killed the king. He was our people's true hope. Curses be to Malacath.",""
"55049764-0-9603","I guess I've got one more battle in me. For Solgra, right?nnDamn, I hate how this turned out!",""
"55049764-0-9599","You and the king seemed to have a rather serious discussion.nnI certainly hope that everything is all right. I'm really looking forward to hearing what Kurog has to say when the moot begins.",""
"55049764-12-9044","We will rebuild Orsinium.","Ricostruiremo Orsinium."
"55049764-12-9534","Never skinned a werewolf myself. Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. Unfortunately, that Menninia's sharp as a Morkul blade. I doubt we could fool her with old ragged wolf pelts.",""
"55049764-7-9522","I hear Corintthac's lackeys are half-mad with grief. Seems you've really set them back.nnTalk to Ushang. He'll want to hear that the job is done.",""
"55049764-7-9419","There's water in a cistern along the wall. Hurry!",""
"55049764-7-9709","Interesting. The layout of these switches may have something to do with the statues. Let me consult my book.",""
"55049764-7-9620","Ah, yes. You do have the eyes of a killer. Eyes devoid of mercy, without remorse. How many lives ended looking up at those eyes, I wonder? Enough that the Night Mother has noticed you. nnAnd so I come to you with an opportunity.",""
"55049764-7-9616","I'll go on in and talk to Danni when I am good and ready,.",""
"55049764-7-9650","Finally, someone competent! My brother's gotten us in trouble again, and I don't know how we'll get out of it. Talk to him, would you?",""
"55049764-7-9634","Silver-Claws gave me some details. I am sure Velsa was happy to have someone do most of the work while she stayed in the shadows. Typical.",""
"55049764-7-9661","We should make haste, I think.",""
"55049764-7-9621","You're not from about here, are you? Not as pious as seems proper. How'd you like to earn some honest coin for dishonest work?",""
"55049764-9-9709","First thing to do is sneak past these lamps. Fortunately, Malcolm knows a secret entrance that will let us avoid them. He's waiting for us up the hill.",""
"55049764-1-9633","Ah, there you are, dear. Corvus let me know you'd be coming. It's good you've arrived safely.nnI'm Viera, matron of this sanctuary. I welcome you into our family and into our home. I hope you will see it as your own in time.",""
"55049764-5-9694","Stupid Nicholas. Always hiding away his own little trophies from his raids. This is what we need to show Falorah.",""
"55049764-5-9389","Yeah, yeah. Tell Chief Bazrag I'll attend the funeral. Trinimac knows they couldn't start the ceremony without the innkeeper's daughter.",""
"55049764-5-9110","Who are you?",""
"55049764-3-9622","There are things we need to do, if the guild is to recover from our recent misfortunes.",""
"55049764-30-9611","Please, friend, please! Look all you like, spend freely, spend it all!",""
"55049764-1-9638","New-sister! Welcome! Welcome! Haha! nnName's Arne. I hope you're finding everything to your liking here. You'll feel at home in no time.",""
"55049764-1-9642","Like your hands attached? Then don't touch my coins.",""
"55049764-1-9677","Take this paint and map. Paint our crew's mark at the Xs on this map to mark our territory.  Simple, eh?nnApparently not. Used to be Stumpy Percel's job, until he lost his nerve and found my axe. In his neck. You want to live, don't be like Stumpy.",""
"55049764-1-9651","Welcome to the Flowing Bowl, sailor. What can I get you?",""
"55049764-1-9691","This woman … she claims to be Valnalion's daughter … the family resemblance, it's unmistakable!",""
"55049764-1-9694","So? How'd the gathering go?nnI've learned a couple things, but you go first.",""
"55049764-1-9703","You found a clue to where Locke might be?",""
"55049764-1-9674","So you're looking for someone to go with you to the wedding? I'm just saying… I'm a good dancer.",""
"55049764-1-9675","Are you actually thinking of asking me tonight? Well, I do suppose I'm the best looking one here, so I can't blame you.",""
"55049764-1-9678","Our Khajiit friend told me you'd be coming.",""
"55049764-1-9717","What have you discovered?",""
"55049764-1-9697","I'm not sure what I'm going to do next. My father is dead, but I do have a connection to him.nnLady Sulima and I need to talk. I don't know if we'll ever be friends, but I owe it to my father's memory to try.",""
"55049764-1-9698","Oh, walker … Bakhum did not expect this. This is no simple sickness—it's the work of dro-m'Athra. You must go! This one can hear Lorkhaj's song already. Can you hear it? The tapping?nnThis one is sorry for bringing you here. Flee while you can!",""
"55049764-1-9701","I think you really should leave now. Or I will have my manservant escort you out.",""
"55049764-1-9610","<<1>> will forgive me for some of the things I said, won't she?nnI'm sure she will. I'm sure.",""
"55049764-3-9598","I don't have a lot of patience for Kurog's games. The sooner he says his peace, the sooner I can return to my own stronghold.",""
"55049764-2-9479","That was a beautiful ceremony. So respectful and yet also inspiring. I particularly liked the fire. It was so … fiery!nnAnd I'm glad they made Bazrag the king. I think he'll do a fine job for his people.",""
"55049764-2-9436","This isn't a good time to visit the temple. We have a bit of a situation.nnI humbly suggest that you come back later.",""
"55049764-2-9482","He turned me into a messenger when I first arrived, but I never suspected the king was a villain.nnI guess no one is above greed and corruption.",""
"55049764-14-9044","Whoever dares oppose the uniting of the Orc clans will feel my wrath!",""
"55049764-14-9534","Ah, look who's back! I've got a whole new batch of contracts here if you're looking for work. What do you say? Interested?",""
"55049764-23-9611","What do you think? The gloss of ebony, it is like staring into a distant, dark lake. Engrossing, yes?",""
"55049764-5-9640","This one looks forward to the conclusion of our plan. We do still have our plan, yes?",""
"55049764-35-9611","Why, if it is not her best friend in all of the world! You are here to make us very happy, again?",""
"55049764-6-9694","Thanks for getting me in. Took me a bit to find what I was going to wear, but I figured this would work.",""
"55049764-6-9709","Let's see what we can find in the Dark Room. Velsi will keep trying to get this other door open.",""
"55049764-6-9697","I've done it! I've deciphered my father's ledger. It took a lot of work, and a lot of research, but I understand what he was doing in Abah's Landing … and I think I know where he last went before he was killed.",""
"55049764-6-9640","Jone and Jode, this one is glad to see a friendly face! These Red Sails are the worst kind of pirate. A modest bribe is business, but this farce is not business.",""
"55049764-6-9449","Malacath whispered of your strength. Those who remain true to the Daedric Prince of Vengeance must band together in these difficult times.nnYet they who share our faith now move against us.",""
"55049764-12-9070","You avenged my son. I will not forget what you did for Shatul today. Nor will the clan.nnIf you are willing, I have need of someone so capable.",""
"55049764-12-9522","Good work on that last assignment. Things are quiet for now, but that never lasts. Come back and see me later. I might have something for you.",""
"55049764-0-9589","Good luck, my friend.nnI'll remain here to protect the priests, as Chief Bazrag requested. I'll look forward to hearing how you beat the mad king when you return.",""
"55049764-0-9595","An honest-to-goodness secret passage.nnIf I wasn't terrified, this would be kind of exciting.",""
"55049764-0-9602","Now this is more like it.nnNo harpies. No giant catapults slamming into walls. Just a few peaceful drinks with good friends. This is how it should have been from the moment I got here.",""
"55049764-0-9605","So Torug's Armlet remains on the mountain, eh? Good. Gives me an excuse to head back up there. This damn hill won't beat me twice!",""
"55049764-0-9606","Oh friend! It's so good to see you!nnAre you surprised? I told you I was going to find my fortune in the big city. And look! Khajiit clothes! Although, I don't think they had Wrothgar's weather in mind when they designed these.",""
"55049764-0-9614","I watch the horses more closely than I watch my children.",""
"55049764-0-9619","I'd better find someplace to hide. It isn't that I don't believe you can't do anything … but I don't want to disappear like my friends.",""
"55049764-0-9621","With Andrya off to who knows where, I could use a drink. A stiff one. What say you meet me in Anvil's tavern, and we drink to our success?",""
"55049764-0-9630","Hah, back with treasure. And whoa that's a lot of treasure! That's magnificent!",""
"55049764-0-9636","nyi - meet me at docks",""
"55049764-0-9637","You'd best do whatever it is you're going to do … somewhere else.",""
"55049764-0-9642","Looks like you're done here. Run along.",""
"55049764-0-9652","You make sure your little lady shows up. I'll handle getting her an audience.",""
"55049764-0-9653","With what you've paid, I'll be able to pull out every one of Kireth's bad planks, hire a real carpenter to plug the holes, and make a small profit. So, bottoms up.",""
"55049764-0-9655","I never thought I'd have a Dark Elf working under my roof, but if he balances my books, I'll take him out and drink him under the table. Ha! I bet the poor lad passes out the moment he samples Eastmarch mead.",""
"55049764-0-9658","Please tell me we are going to do something to help Danni?",""
"55049764-0-9659","Your brow is furrowed. I suppose I should ask you what you are worried about.",""
"55049764-0-9668","If you go along to the Thieves Guild Sanctuary, I'm sure the Guildmaster can answer the rest of your questions. I'll be along, too, but I think Quen needs a little more convincing.",""
"55049764-0-9669","Thank Tall Papa you all arrived. I thought Rhanbiq would never shut up.",""
"55049764-0-9674","Tonight is going to be so exciting!",""
"55049764-0-9675","I'm going as a job, remember that. If you expect this to be an actual date, I'll break your face.",""
"55049764-0-9678","Examine all of the options if you'd like. I'm only lending you one though, so think on it before you choose.",""
"55049764-0-9681","I'm excited about this!",""
"55049764-0-9682","I haven't dressed up like this since back home.",""
"55049764-0-9685","Please, come on in when ready. The party tonight will be fabulous!",""
"55049764-0-9691","It was a … pleasure meeting you, and the young lady. She has already taken advantage of Val's emergency exit. I suggest you do, too.nnBut, please, tell her that I am here when she wants to talk. About Val, about the ledger … or anything.",""
"55049764-0-9697","I'll never forgive Lady Sulima and I don't care what happens to her! She's on her own.nnMyself, I want to find out who killed my father. It might have been the Violet Lamp, or someone else. Whoever it was, they'll pay!",""
"55049764-0-9701","We don't get visitors here very often. Especially ones we have not invited.",""
"55049764-0-9707","Velsa told me that the Violet Lamps got to Locke before you could reach him. I'm glad you were able to rescue him. Even if he's too beaten up to help us, at least he's alive.nnNow. Are you ready to travel to Malooc's Tomb?",""
"55049764-0-9711","Dear Journal,nnUse the phrase ""Klatu Verta Nicto"" to disable the traps. Also, the Thieves Guild doesn't know about the secret exit I can use to return to my vault outside the city, which I marked on this map.nnP.S. Remember to burn this journal.",""
"55049764-0-9717","Let's head back to Thieves Guild Headquarters, fill the others in, and plan our next move.",""
"55049764-0-9723","You shouldn't keep the Guildmaster waiting.",""
"55049764-13-9044","Make it stronger!",""
"55049764-13-9070","This is a private matter. I must tend to my son.",""
"55049764-13-9522","Thank Mala—I mean, thank Trinimac you're back. Got another crisis for you. Interested?",""
"55049764-13-9534","Hmm? Sorry, I'm up to my arse in contracts here. You looking for work? Come back and see me later. I might have something for you.",""
"55049764-1-9567","We do good work here … great work! But we're idiot children compared to our ancestors. Morkuldin once produced weapons fit for gods, but now we settle for kings.nnAh, well. I should get back to it.",""
"55049764-1-9586","Did you hear? There's some kind of trouble at Fharun Stronghold.",""
"55049764-1-9588","What in Trinimac's name is going on? Why did Kurog send soldiers after me?nnThey acted like I'd done something horrible. I didn't want to show it, but I was frightened for my life! I'm just glad you arrived when you did.",""
"55049764-1-9589","This was just an adventure until now.nnWe were strong, fearless. But to lose one of our own … I don't know if I can handle this.",""
"55049764-1-9591","Just as the grand city nears completion, the king has died. If I wasn't so busy, I'd be weeping in the street right now.",""
"55049764-1-9593","Kurog and his love for Trinimac is what's hurting this whole region.",""
"55049764-1-9598","I'm all out of patience for Kurog and his political games. How much longer does he plan to keep us here?nnI have a clan to run, you know.",""
"55049764-1-9600","What are you doing? Taking in the sights while everything crumbles around us?nnYou need to get to the temple and you need to get there now!",""
"55049764-1-9602","Werewolves, harpies—what's next? Probably an enraged pack of lamias with banekin riding atop their backs!nnYou know, that actually might be fun. I'll send word to you when they finally get here.",""
"55049764-1-9603","If this is what it means to be a hero, I'm pretty sure I'm done with that dream.nnI've had enough of death, of seeing my friends get hurt. Kurog. He's going to pay for this. I swear on my mother's bow, he's going to pay.",""
"55049764-1-9604","So we're taking Torug's Armlet back to Orsinium? Good. Do you need someone to deliver it? I mean, I'd be happy to take it. It'll be tough with my ankle and all, but I'll take the risk.",""
"55049764-1-9605","So Torug's Armlet's headed to Orsinium, huh? Doesn't matter. I don't care if there's nothing up there but a kick in the tusks. I'm going to reach the top of this hill. Count on it!",""
"55049764-1-9607","Dwemer constructs can be surprisingly affectionate. For mindless machines, that is.nnWe're helping to put the finishing touches on the city. The king will probably make me a duke or something after he sees how hard these little fellows work!",""
"55049764-1-9608","I'd thought Morkul would want nothing to do with the Mages Guild. I admit, their skill with enchanting surprised me.nnBest to keep an open mind.",""
"55049764-1-9617","Are you Silver-Claws' friend? I've been waiting for you.",""
"55049764-1-9619","All my friends … they're disappearing!",""
"55049764-1-9622","Finally, a bit of luck. Bless the Sign of the Shadow, maybe things will start going our way again.",""
"55049764-1-9631","This one hopes that you and the gentle-natured Velsa were successful?",""
"55049764-1-9635","Thank goodness you've returned! Danni is beside herself. I'm afraid she'll do something rash.",""
"55049764-1-9637","If you want a disguise, I'll sell you one. I'm not taking a risk for someone I don't know without proper compensation.",""
"55049764-1-9644","Who're you? Never mind … there's plenty of work to go around. Pick up a broom or a hammer or whatever the Violet Lamp hired you for and get to work.",""
"55049764-1-9648","Finished speaking with the others? If so, we can move forward.",""
"55049764-1-9649","I can't wait to get started. The sooner we finish, the sooner we're bound for Sentinel.",""
"55049764-1-9652","What a disaster. That delicate little Breton bard gets in one little scrap and suddenly he can't play tonight's show. How do you strain a finger? What does that even mean?nnSorry, I'm rambling. What can I help you with?",""
"55049764-1-9653","You look hearty, and not too drunk. Interested in a job?nnWe skirted a hurricane just off Khenarthi's Roost — oddest thing, came out of nowhere — but we took some damage. I need someone who can hold a board still and hammer a nail straight.",""
"55049764-1-9654","An entire day's catch, lost to the hungry sea. So many wasted fish!nnThis is Jode's punishment for hiring an academic dungman to do an honest khajiit's work.",""
"55049764-1-9655","Ysmir's beard, a customer! Don't believe those petty rumors on the docks. Our vault is impervious to theft. In fact, I'd go so far as to say we've got an impervious vault!",""
"55049764-1-9657","You are good to get the others moving. This one will await further developments and hope for your success.",""
"55049764-1-9658","There you are. This is kind of exciting. nnOf course, I am worried about Danni too. But still. Kind of exciting.",""
"55049764-1-9660","Apparently, Walks-Softly is a representative of the Abah's Landing Thieves Guild. He's brought us here to explain why those ""Violet Lamp"" people were waiting for us at Fultstrom Homestead.",""
"55049764-1-9667","The gang's all here. Except Danni. And instead, a newcomer.",""
"55049764-1-9669","I was worried I might never see the inside of this place again.",""
"55049764-1-9672","You'll need to choose someone to come with you tonight. Once I know who all is going, I can forge some invites with everyone's name on them.",""
"55049764-1-9676","I heard you're looking for a companion for the evening. Have I mentioned how much I love parties?",""
"55049764-1-9696","You will talk to Bakhum? Oh, praise Alkosh! This carries a heavy burden!",""
"55049764-1-9708","This is futile. Look around you. There's no windows. You're stuck in a room with me and the only way in or out is that door your friend there is holding until it gets knocked down.",""
"55049764-1-9719","Hello friend. The Thieves Guild again once again needs your help.",""
"55049764-14-9522","Looking for work? If not, move along. I haven't got time for idle chit-chat.",""
"55049764-2-9431","I'll watch over Eveli. You go and see what Chief Bazrag wants to talk about.",""
"55049764-2-9432","Is … is that you? Oh yeah, that's you. I'd recognize those footfalls anywhere.",""
"55049764-2-9480","Eveli woke up and wanted to come here straight away.nnIt's good to see her up and around. She'll be her old self in no time.",""
"55049764-2-9483","I have never attended a funeral before. Things like this, they don't happen where I come from.",""
"55049764-2-9484","Kurog was always headstrong, confident. But these things I've heard he did? That's not the Kurog I knew. Not the mercenary I fought beside and trusted my life to.nnIt just doesn't make any sense.",""
"55049764-2-9491","Kurog's favorite ale will be at the keep on time. Don't worry about that.",""
"55049764-2-9492","Thank you for gathering everyone. It's important that they're all here to see what happens next.",""
"55049764-2-9522","Don't hesitate to break those machines to pieces. This Dwarven garbage is nothing but trouble.nnMake sure to speak to Birkhu when you're done. He's anxious to close the book on this.",""
"55049764-2-9591","With every day, more and more of the city nears completion. But these rumors of traitors and assassins—I fear for the safety of my workers!",""
"55049764-2-9596","I had heard that the city was coming along nicely, but I must say, I'm truly impressed.nnIf Kurog's goal was to capture his essence in stone, then Orsinium is a perfect testament to his cold and heartless arrogance.",""
"55049764-2-9597","Is something wrong? What were you and Kurog whispering about over there?nnOh, never mind. I really don't care. I just want to find something strong to drink.",""
"55049764-2-9598","You look like I feel. I take it you're as thrilled to be here as I am.nnDon't worry. I expect that this will all be over soon.",""
"55049764-2-9599","Not that it's any of my business, but I hope the news you brought doesn't affect the moot. I'm really looking forward to hearing what Kurog has to say.",""
"55049764-2-9601","My husband cared about Kurog in his own way. I know he shouldn't feel this way, but he's disappointed that events forced you to slay the Orc who would be king.",""
"55049764-2-9607","These little Dwemer constructs are particularly loyal and affectionate. Sometimes I almost forget that they are only machines.nnWe're going to explore these ruins as soon as I finish making a few simple adjustments to account for all the undead.",""
"55049764-2-9610","Did you … what happened? I thought I was someplace else for a moment. Someone else … a Breton knight?",""
"55049764-2-9616","You need to work on your speed. And make sure you learn every alley and byway in this city.",""
"55049764-2-9620","Quintus Varo is dead. Yes, I know of your success. You will find that the Brotherhood has eyes everywhere.nnYou have done well. And thus our covenant is made, signed in blood. You are forever part of our family now. Welcome, sister.",""
"55049764-2-9621","My sister's safe, and alive, and surprisingly calm about this whole mess. That's all I can ask.nnThank you, my dear. I couldn't have exposed the Order of Akatosh's corruption on my own.",""
"55049764-2-9622","Well, I wasn't sure if you'd make it. Walks-Softly sent word about the trouble you had in Eastmarch.nnGlad to see the Iron Wheel didn't catch you. I understand Quen got out, too?",""
"55049764-2-9624","The weather here is very hot. I should not like to come out of my tent for any amount of money.",""
"55049764-2-9630","Remember, you only have a limited amount of time to grab what you can before it gets too dangerous. Don't dally and don't be seen.nnBut… if you're feeling cocky and want to earn more coin, I've heard there are hidden passages in these tunnels.",""
"55049764-2-9631","This name Cosh, it has been heard recently in Abah's Landing. A new rich lordling. Ambitious too, it would seem.",""
"55049764-2-9634","Good to see you safe. Did you make it into Hiradirge?",""
"55049764-2-9635","I think it's best if we pursue our investigations separately. Certain of my contacts won't talk to me if I have a shadow. Likewise, I don't want to get in your way.nnMeet me back here when you're done.",""
"55049764-2-9637","I've always said that clothes make the man, woman, cat, lizard, or tall, dark, squirrelly-thing. I'm sure you fit into one of those categories, though your wardrobe could use a bit of improvement.nnWhat can I do for you?",""
"55049764-2-9638","New-brother! Welcome! Welcome! Haha! nnName's Arne. If there's anything you need, anything at all, you come to me, eh?",""
"55049764-2-9640","Did you see that shaveskin saunter? So proud of his negotiation skills! This one could barely contain her laughter.",""
"55049764-2-9641","Private game. Go beg somewhere else.",""
"55049764-2-9642","I've got nothing else to say to you.",""
"55049764-2-9643","Please, this one simply wants to dice in peace.",""
"55049764-2-9644","Go away. I don't know you.",""
"55049764-2-9648","Well met, Sister. I am Elam Terano. I provide assignments and instruction for new family members, so you'll be seeing a lot of me.",""
"55049764-2-9649","While I'm toiling away, what will Kireth be doing? Do tell!",""
"55049764-2-9650","I don't know how you convinced these louts to hire us, but thank you. It's good to know at least someone around here is competent. What have you got for me?",""
"55049764-2-9653","Drink up, sailor. Never know when they're run out of Rotmeth.",""
"55049764-2-9654","So many nets, so many fish, and so little time. Shantin's life is a story of woe.",""
"55049764-2-9655","Welcome to the bank of Anvil! You'll not find a more secure vault in all the city!",""
"55049764-2-9656","This steel needs guidance, friend. Return another time when I'm less busy.",""
"55049764-2-9657","It is good you are here, my friend.  Our mutual friend, Danni, needs your help.",""
"55049764-2-9658","I'm worried for Danni. What is going to happen to her? Or to our guild?",""
"55049764-2-9660","Let's get going. Hop on the boat.",""
"55049764-2-9661","I have been watching the mark. This will not be difficult.",""
"55049764-2-9669","I have a feeling that Lady Falorah and I will get along rather well.",""
"55049764-2-9672","You've returned with the invitation, yes?",""
"55049764-2-9673","Have the invite? Give it to Silver-Claws",""
"55049764-2-9674","There's a party?",""
"55049764-2-9675","Don't expect me to get dressed up.",""
"55049764-2-9676","I love parties.",""
"55049764-2-9677","Argh! I've had it up to here with these bloody pirates. They erased our sigils again. How many of these idiots must I kill before they leave?",""
"55049764-2-9678","I'll ensure your outfit arrives when you enter the party. I always keep my word.",""
"55049764-2-9680","This woman! She knew my father. I mean, she …. knew … my father.nnYou need to talk to her. I've got to think.",""
"55049764-2-9688","Come on, you're a sweet talker. I'm sure you can convince her that Cosh, er, Nicholas, er… what are we calling him?nnAnyways, he's a bad, bad man. She can't marry him.",""
"55049764-2-9694","We need to get inside before Cosh realizes we're here. Getting to Falorah and warning her is all I care about.",""
"55049764-2-9695","Oh, one tip. The way you survive in Abah's Landing is by being the biggest, baddest, brashest thug out there.nnDon't let Shalug intimidate you. Just because she says she's the queen of Daggerfall, don't you believe it.",""
"55049764-2-9697","What a filthy, scheming crone! She's worried about losing her manor when I've lost my father! My family, gone, and she was going to take everything that remained!nnI'm going to leave her alive, but that's all. I don't want to hear or see her again.",""
"55049764-2-9699","Did you know my cousin is the one getting married? Lady Falorah herself. She wants me on my best behavior. Says I can't be drinking during her big day. Haha, jokes on her. I'm not passing up this stuff.nnThis is the good stuff.",""
"55049764-2-9700","How can you be so cruel? My home is all I have! Cast out on the street, I won't last two weeks!",""
"55049764-2-9701","What is it now? I thought I asked you to leave.",""
"55049764-2-9703","When I got here, the shop was in shambles. Locke isn't here, and it looks like his shop was attacked.nnWhere is he? Let's search the shop for clues.",""
"55049764-2-9704","Ugh, I'm tired of standing around. Everyone is having so much fun, and here I am, doing nothing. All because Cosh wants his servants ready to attend any needs Lady Falorah might have.nnHow can I even attend her needs while out here?",""
"55049764-2-9706","Spare change?",""
"55049764-2-9707","Velsa told me what happened at the tailor shop. I'm glad you were to rescue Locke in time. He's coming with us to Malooc's Tomb. Are you ready to leave?",""
"55049764-2-9709","We're almost through. Let's hope there's no more surprises ahead.",""
"55049764-2-9717","So this is where Nicholas has been hiding his loot. Let's have a look around.",""
"55049764-2-9720","You proved your strength of will in the mists of Longhaven, and again in Hrota Cave. You have the mind of a true hunter.",""
"55049764-2-9722","That's the Eye I know. If we split up, we'll cover more ground. She's in these ruins. We'll find her. And when we find her, my friend, she dies.",""
"55049764-3-9431","I've done what I can to heal Eveli's wounds and ease her pain. The rest is up to her.nnShe's been asking for you. Seeing you will do her a world of good.",""
"55049764-3-9479","The high priestess … she looks so peaceful now. I think she'd appreciate all this attention.",""
"55049764-3-9483","I hope you're not here to take me on another adventure. I'm done with this wretched place. With you, the king, everyone.nnI … I apologize. Talviah's death hit me harder than I realized. I know you did what was needed. Eveli told me as much.",""
"55049764-3-9582","Look who it is! You made all this possible, my friend. You brought all the chiefs together.nnI needed to step away and have a moment to myself. All this excitement! But I promise you, this will be a moot the Orsimer won't soon forget!",""
"55049764-3-9591","Just look at how our city progresses! And now that the Winterborn warlord is dead, I expect we'll have few problems from here on in.",""
"55049764-3-9597","I'm here, as promised. I just hope this doesn't turn out to be another one of Kurog's time wasters.nnIt is nice to see what they've done with our stone, though. Rock from Graystone Quarry, it's the finest in the land!",""
"55049764-3-9621","Thank you for not fighting me, my dear. I know you could have slaughtered Merivus and his sycophants, but a holy bloodbath isn't our goal here.nnUnfortunately, Andrya wasn't so accommodating. She's quite good at sneaking off. Family trait.",""
"55049764-3-9660","Glad you could make it! I have a few things we need to discuss before we enter Fultstrom Homestead.",""
"55049764-3-9661","We need to find out where Danni is being held.",""
"55049764-3-9680","This is the first lead I've had regarding my father's whereabouts. I hope we can find something out!",""
"55049764-3-9700","I'm sure you can make Quen understand. She is young and can go anywhere, do anything. I'm old, and my home in Abah's Landing is all I have.",""
"55049764-3-9722","We'll have a better chance of finding her if we split up. She's in these ruins, somewhere. And when we find her, my friend, she dies.",""
"55049764-4-9041","Welcome to Orsinium.",""
