"165399380-0-30543","Even sick people have to eat, so we set up these cooking fires. And the Maulborn were kind enough to provide some much needed supplies. Don't you just love those guys?",""

"165399380-0-30548","The Maulborn keep atrocious records. I hope their elixirs are better than their bookkeeping.",""
"165399380-0-30549","Please, can you spare some gold? I want to hire a cart to bring my sick cousin to the Serk.",""
"165399380-0-30550","Who are these Maulborn and where did they get this miraculous cure?",""
"165399380-0-30551","People out there cry to get in. People in here scream for the cure.nnI'm so tired of all the yelling.",""

"165399380-0-30555","The nostrum gave me the cure, but I don't feel much better. I wonder how long before it takes effect?",""

"165399380-0-30557","I came here so my dear Urynnar could be cured, but I've been inspired. If they'll have me, I'm going to join the Maulborn and make sure others get the help they need.",""
"165399380-0-30558","The guards, the locked gates, the rules and regulations. It's like these Maulborn were some kind of cult or something.",""

"165399380-0-30623","Velyn Harbor survived, but many of our homes burned.",""

"165399380-0-30636","We cornered a few of the Ra Gada and their pet wood orcs on the ship. They can't leave the harbor, but no one wants to go in and clear them out, yet.",""
"165399380-0-30637","The mayor of Velyn Harbor died during the attack. We need to find a new leader.",""
"165399380-0-30638","We have a lot of work to do. The Drublog destroyed almost everything.",""

"165399380-0-30776","They say you should wrestle wolves when you're feeling lonely. I tried it once, but it didn't make me feel any better.",""

"165399380-0-30778","This town's all right. People stick by each other.",""
"165399380-0-30779","These blades aren't bad. Doubt they could hold up to our Colovian armor, but for a backwater hovel like this, it's good quality.",""

"165399380-0-30785","I've got half a mind to up and leave this swamp-hole. Never seen an insect dwarf a dog! And I certainly don't want to find out if they can bite like one.",""
