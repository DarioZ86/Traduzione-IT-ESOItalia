"55049764-0-3607","I'm thinking we're going to need grappling hooks. They're very versatile, you know.",""
"55049764-0-3608","I was able to give Commander Marone the slip, thankfully. The protective spells around the Redoubt should stay empowered for a while longer, while we accomplish our task here.",""
"55049764-0-3609","That was quite the satisfying sound, wasn't it?nnI could almost imagine hearing the screams of those crushed Imperial dogs.",""
"55049764-0-3610","It is finished. The earth's strength shall return now.",""
"55049764-0-3611","Well done. Now the winds will change for foul Angof.",""
"55049764-0-3612","Balance returns. Soon the Wyrd Tree will be safe.",""
"55049764-0-3613","I will assist <<1>> with his preparations. He'll need my help in the coming weeks.nnYour aid had been invaluable.",""
"55049764-0-3614","I hope that all of our friends and neighbors are safe.",""
"55049764-0-3615","Now that you've paid for a ticket, you're free to explore the gray market.nnTry not to start any fights, or that ticket won't help you.",""
"55049764-0-3616","With the might of the Mages Guild on our side, perhaps we can finally push back Montclair's soldiers and take back Shornhelm's northern district!",""
"55049764-0-3617","Without Arkay's Blessing, the mortal clay and immortal souls of our honored dead are at risk.nnThank you for taking the time to help me. My task is hardly glamorous, but it is important.",""
"55049764-0-3618","Ah, someone new to talk to. Are you here for something specific or just to say hello?",""
"55049764-0-3619","The Queen of Evermore would never allow this to happen knowingly.nnShe was always an advocate for the people of Evermore, rich and poor alike.",""
"55049764-0-3620","I hope you're able to find  <<1>>.nnI've never seen her so determined!",""
"55049764-0-3621","So you're the one wreaking havoc down there among those horkers? I've tangled with a Reachman or two in my day, and my helmet's off to anyone who charges into their ranks that way. nnDon't suppose you've come to enlist in the town guard, have you?",""
"55049764-0-3622","Welcome back, Arzhela. Good work! First, you ran this kingdom into the ground. Then you dumped it into my lap!nnNow, the two of you repay me by sabotaging my plans and destroying any hope we had of surviving the Reachmen attack!",""
"55049764-0-3623","You mean to go through with this? I suppose it's out of my hands.",""
"55049764-0-3624","Go away! We don't want any trouble.",""
"55049764-0-3625","What do you wish of us, mortal?",""
"55049764-0-3626","You're back. And in one piece. Lady Laurent has also returned in time for supper, as usual. nnAll is right with the world.",""
"55049764-0-3627","Perhaps you'll have another chance to assist me in the future. Until then, good luck to you.",""
"55049764-0-3628","You've been a great help. Over time, the remaining undead will find peace.nnMay the goddess bless you in your travels, <<1>>.",""
"55049764-0-3629","The soldier's name was Ishan. His father requested the wake be held by the inn north of here.nnThey do not know he is missing yet. Please, let us keep this between us.",""
"55049764-0-3630","There is nothing left here for this old man.nnI'll wait for my time to return to the sands.",""
"55049764-0-3631","Most soldiers are buried at <<1>>, but Ishan's family insisted he should be buried here.nnI've almost finished digging the grave. Don't fall into it.",""
"55049764-0-3632","I'll go to the altar and pray for your safety, friend. Once you have the <<1>>, we'll break the curse.nnI really don't want to spend eternity paying for a mistake I didn't make.",""
"55049764-0-3633","Finally, <<1>> put others before himself!",""
"55049764-0-3634","We need to cut down enough of these monsters to clear a path through the camp. nnThen we might have a chance to retake the city.",""
"55049764-0-3635","I'd love to join you on the attack, but these troops are green. Most of them have never fought a werewolf, so I'll need to stick with them to show them how. nnBut kill a few for me.",""
"55049764-0-3636","What? Is Queen Arlimahera here? nnYou do not look like one of her messengers. No, that was so long ago.",""
"55049764-0-3637","This place is a graveyard of harpy victims. Save who you can!",""
"55049764-0-3638","Have you spoken to <<1>> yet?nnHe'll have me doing his errands for a month if I keep this portal open much longer!",""
"55049764-0-3639","My flock has been continually diminishing. They just seem to disappear. What is happening?",""
"55049764-0-3640","The cursed crown is on the left as you enter the vault. nnGood luck, I suppose. That's all I have to offer.",""
"55049764-0-3641","See these vines? Corruption runs through them and they choke the sacred stone. Soon, they will tap into the stone's magic and defile it completely.nnIf you will help me, I can destroy these foul vines.",""
"55049764-0-3642","Corruption radiates from this … thing. I can feel it worming into my soul. The corruption spreads outward, altering or killing all the forest creatures. We have to destroy it!",""
"55049764-0-3643","I loathe these vines. They reek of death and corruption. But every time I try to deal with them, I'm attacked by cultists or corrupted creatures.",""
"55049764-0-3644","<<1>> told me you would come. I hope this works.nnPlease don't let anything happen to me while I destroy these vines.",""
"55049764-0-3646","The tunnels are crawling with the undead. Be careful, <<1>>.",""
"55049764-0-3647","It's unfortunate we were too late in warning Tu'whacca's Throne, but I'm glad you were able to aid them.",""
"55049764-0-3649","You're still alive? Well, it seems I'll have to remedy that.",""
"55049764-0-3650","You have done much to help us, but I cannot rest while the Ra Gada sergeants still roam these ruins.",""
"55049764-0-3651","I don't want to leave the prince alone for long. We'll have to be quick.",""
"55049764-0-3652","Your choices were difficult, but you have made them well.",""
"55049764-0-3653","Hopefully Queen Therese will put a stop to this.",""
"55049764-0-3654","My retainers and I will be ready to assist you at Bangkorai Garrison when the time comes.",""
"55049764-0-3655","That … that was the thing that attacked my father!",""
"55049764-0-3656","Master Barah's fall was such a tragedy. For a swordmaster to survive such a battle, but never again be able to lift a blade … I don't know if I could have borne that burden.nnThen again, Master Barah was stronger than I am.",""
"55049764-0-3657","The stables are not as busy as they once were. Still, I will care for all beasts that seek shelter within.",""
"55049764-0-3658","Have you come to … no, you're not the provisioner from Sentinel.nnI've had to send farther and farther away for simple things such as salt and grain!",""
"55049764-0-3659","Kill these monstrous creatures and avenge my fallen brethren.",""
"55049764-0-3660","When you choose for one, you choose for all. Such is the burden of leadership.",""
"55049764-0-3661","To act … to not act. Each is a choice.",""
"55049764-0-3662","A single decision can define a civilization. Think hard on your legacy, wayfarer, for even small choices can have great consequences.",""
"55049764-0-3663","Not even the grandest hero can escape regret.",""
"55049764-0-3664","What are you still doing in here? You need to chase down that monster and kill it. Kill it dead!",""
"55049764-0-3665","I've got buyers slavering at my feet and nothing to sell them.nnNo one's going to send ships up this way with the Reachmen lurking about, least of all Wayrest. They act worse than pirates … and smell worse than them, too!",""
"55049764-0-3666","Collect signet rings bearing my family crest from the risen dead in Tu'whacca's Throne.nnYou must wrest their souls from the Withered Hand's clutches. You must put my family to rest!",""
"55049764-0-3667","I'm getting out of Evermore and I advise you to do the same if you know what's good for you.",""
"55049764-0-3668","Speak with <<1>> at the bottom of this tower. nnTell him of the Dremora, and go with my blessing.",""
"55049764-0-3669","Greetings friend. It's nice to see another fighter around here. Our numbers aren't what they used to be. Live by the sword and all that. nnIf you want to join the guild, you should speak to Hareld.",""
"55049764-0-3670","Pardon my intrusion, but I would speak to you on behalf of Queen Arzhela. I am her handmaiden.nnThe queen has … heard of your recent accomplishments, and she asked me to make a private request on her behalf.",""
"55049764-0-3671","Mongrels from the Reach are flooding into Bangkorai, but what does their ""High King"" do for them?nnI have yet to see a response from Wayrest. I hope the people of Evermore realize we can work together t-nnWait, I recognize you.",""
"55049764-0-3672","All my life, others decided my fate. Now that I am no longer a political pawn, I'm actually enjoying myself.nnWhen I help the poor, it's not because I have to, but because I want to.",""
"55049764-0-3673","I offered to help, but she refused. Truth be told, I think she trusts monsters more than other people.nn<<1>> better be hiding among the rocks along the road through the <<2>>. If the Imperials find her, they won't be very understanding.",""
"55049764-0-3674","You shouldn't insult a visiting dignitary.nnMaster Luvian has been nothing less than gracious in his dealings with us.",""
"55049764-0-3675","I hope <<1>> isn't too disappointed.nnPerhaps you can assist him with whatever issues he's having.",""
"55049764-0-3676","Look at the crowds of peasants desperate for news of the queen.nnThey see no leadership, only politicians negotiating their freedom with the Imperials. Hungry for information, they'll listen to anyone, including those paid to incite trouble.",""
"55049764-0-3677","I think you're ready to advance to journeyman. nnYou should travel to Daggerfall to be tested.",""
"55049764-0-3678","You should travel to Daggerfall to take your journeyman test.",""
"55049764-0-3679","Greetings friend. It's nice to see another fighter around here. Our numbers aren't what they used to be. Live by the sword and all that. nnIf you want to join the guild, you should visit the Fighters Guild Hall in Daggerfall.",""
"55049764-0-3680","We have our fair share of problems with the undead around here. You might have noticed.",""
"55049764-0-3681","You seem to have mastered all the skills of an apprentice. nnGo back to Daggerfall and take your journeyman test.",""
"55049764-0-3682","My advice is to go back to Daggerfall and take your journeyman test.",""
"55049764-0-3683","Finally! The Elves came damn near ruining my entire expedition! Of course, Stibbons was really to blame. nnRegardless, I'll be glad to get back to studying the ruins instead of skulking around and trying to hide from the Elves.",""
"55049764-0-3684","Still as the stone that walks. Yes.nnThey remember, you know! They carry their histories, etched in their flesh!",""
"55049764-0-3685","I just keep asking myself, why in Oblivion would you have decided to help Stibbons?nnI have to believe that you were motivated by some deluded sense of pity. I feel sorry … for both of you.",""
"55049764-0-3686","Please, mercy! I was just doing it for the gold. I swear!nnThey asked me to cast aspersions on our queen, but what harm could it do? I've got a family to feed!",""
"55049764-0-3688","Gerric is upstairs. He has a recipe for an expert ring.",""
"55049764-0-3689","You've returned! What did you find?nnWas it jewels? Ivory? Gold?",""
"55049764-0-3690","Thank you for lifting this burden from me. My task here is done.",""
"55049764-0-3691","I can't believe poor Richard is dead. I warned him about rummaging around in those old ruins.",""
"55049764-0-3692","Blessings upon you, traveler.",""
"55049764-0-3693","Shurkul has the recipe. Talk to me when you have learned it",""
"55049764-0-3694","I'm going to make sure these people are taken care of before I leave.nnIt's the least I can do.",""
"55049764-0-3695","Do you have the ring",""
"55049764-0-3696","Antieve has the recipe. Once you learned it come back and talk with me.",""
"55049764-0-3697","Poisoned by spiders … be careful. They are attracted to movement.",""
"55049764-0-3698","I've lost track of how long I've waited here … hours, days, weeks. Who can say?",""
"55049764-0-3699","We will need to bless the voice's bud if you intend to go through with this.",""
"55049764-0-3700","What in Oblivion is he thinking? How dare this petty priest question methe chosen of Arkay? It's obviously because I've earned the god's favor and he hasn't. He's jealous!",""
"55049764-0-3701","Crush some Bloodthorn skulls for me. nnFaith and the Covenant!",""
"55049764-0-3702","You are almost done now… keep on clicking!",""
"55049764-0-3703","That's it. The bud is ready. Take it to the girl, Elara.nnI can't believe Demara continues to help the Sentinel on this mad scheme. We will all suffer for his generosity in the end. The girl knows nothing of the woods, and it will cost us all dearly.",""
"55049764-0-3704","You've already earned the Test of Skill achievement. You can't earn it again.",""
"55049764-0-3705","As the Sentinel, I must warn you that these woods aren't safe. But as Old Gurles, I'm glad to see a friendly face.nnI remember when that child wasn't more than a knee's height, and now she's laid out like a corpse.",""
"55049764-0-3706","I monitor all training with the beasts of Leki's Blade.nnShould their poison become too enfeebling, speak to me, and I will cleanse you.",""
"55049764-0-3707","Have you accomplished your goal, Sentinel-friend?",""
"55049764-0-3708","I should be fine to head back soon. I just need to… figure out how I'm going to skirt the witchmen on my way back through to the docks.",""
"55049764-0-3709","I don't know why we came here… everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong.",""
"55049764-0-3710","How am I any different from you, deciding who is spared and who dies?nnWhat gives you the right to judge me?",""
"55049764-0-3712","I can't believe it. You gave the tools to Tamien? How could you?nnNow I'll never get back to Lady Laurent's good graces! I still can't understandhow can she just drop me after so many years' service?",""
"55049764-0-3713","It sure is strange, this feeling. And it's time for this Viridian Sentinel to have some rest.nnLuckily for the princess and myself, I found someone to take up the mantle.",""
"55049764-0-3714","I don't know what Stenwick is planning, but if it'll save my life, I trust him. I don't understand why these Wyrd people can't see that!",""
"55049764-0-3715","I am reborn!",""
"55049764-0-3716","Don't worry about these fellows.nnNothing will get to them while I'm here.",""
"55049764-0-3718","As long as I have the tools of my trade, I can make an honest living. A good tailor is welcome anywhere!",""
"55049764-0-3719","Thanks again for helping Odei. I don't know what I would have done if I had lost him to the wolves.",""
"55049764-0-3720","I'm safe now. Thank you for bringing me here.",""
"55049764-0-3721","The queen used to love the gardens behind Evermore's castle.nnI made them especially for her, you know.",""
"55049764-0-3722","I couldn't have made it here alone.nnI hope the queen rewards you.",""
"55049764-0-3724","I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that the people have begun to rally around the idea of resisting the Red Rooks. nnThe bad news is the Red Rooks have taken notice.",""
"55049764-0-3725","Tamien, my son. He's come back? I'd hoped I'd see him before the end. Quickly, though, there's no time. We must act!",""
"55049764-0-3726","I hope the soldiers still live. That mist is deadly. nnAnd that fool from Camlornwhat was he thinking? He charged right into the mist after them.",""
"55049764-0-3728","Yes, whatever. Back to it.",""
"55049764-0-3729","Did you teach those Red Rooks a lesson?",""
"55049764-0-3730","Gave 'em a good wallop, did you?nnThe captan's not going to like that.",""
"55049764-0-3731","<<1>> spends most of her time sleeping inside her basket. There are lots of baskets and vases around Bergama. Perhaps she's hiding in one of them.nnFeel free to kill any other snakes you find. I'm only worried about <<1>>.",""
"55049764-0-3732","Even if he could come back, I wouldn't want to see him.nnHe chose the king's service. He could have had so much more.",""
"55049764-0-3733","In Orsinium, we burned an effigy of each fallen hero and feasted until the smoke cleared.nnFor some, it took hours. For others, it took days.",""
"55049764-0-3734","The Pearl is the Way and the Guide, the light to the Far Shores and back again, placed by Tall Papa's hand.",""
"55049764-0-3735","Your keen tactical mind and honorable actions have seen us through a tight spot.nnThe Saltwalker Company consider us allies for preventing a bad contract, and you've stopped the Withered Hand cold. Well done.",""
"55049764-0-3736","If you talk to the witch, take care. I hear if you look one in the eyes, her gaze can follow you anywhere.nnAnd never lay a hand on one. Poor Stennic tried to rough one up. They never found him.",""
"55049764-0-3737","You can find <<1>> in the <<2>>, just east of <<3>>.nnKeep a light step, and may the woods will guide you.",""
"55049764-0-3738","I'm glad we're doing something. nnWhen this is all over, we'll be proud of what we accomplished against these … these … ruffians!",""
"55049764-0-3739","Heseph never gave up. And neither will I.nnI'll help Sellan rally the townsfolk. We'll make these bastards pay.",""
"55049764-0-3740","Well negotiated, <<1>>. Your keen tactical mind and honorable actions have seen us through a tight spot. The Saltwalker Company consider us allies for preventing a bad contract, and you've stopped the Hand cold.nnWe may even recruit them. Well done!",""
"55049764-0-3742","If I go one more day without a slice of cheese, I will fight my way through the ranks of the Seventh Legion all the way to Alik'r!",""
"55049764-0-3743","I'll head out and start rallying the townsfolk after you leave and I lock up here.nnNo reason to leave an open invitation to those damn bandits.",""
"55049764-0-3744","I saw Hadjara's youngest child fighting with Mirielle's daughter over a slice of bread. I hope Hadjara can earn a ration token soon or they will be kicked out of the tunnels.",""
"55049764-0-3745","These ration tokens are a good idea. It's a shame that there isn't another way to track our food supplies.",""
"55049764-0-3746","I keep my ration token close at all times. I don't want to end up frantic and starving, like Hadjara.",""
"55049764-0-3747","Hadjara had better keep her children in line. I know they are hungry, but that is no excuse to start fighting and stealing.",""
"55049764-0-3748","Meet me at the center of the graveyard. I'll be along shortly.nnRemember, I can clear a path for the soldiers, but I can't protect myself and perform the magic.",""
"55049764-0-3749","The smugglers have taken over large sections of the sewers below. When you find them, show those scum what happens when they wrong an honest citizen. There's a price to pay for such wickedness.",""
"55049764-0-3750","I must thank you again.nnHad you not discovered my body, I might have been trapped on this plane of existence forever.",""
"55049764-0-3751","The swords of the Saltwalker Militia will never belong to the Withered Hand now. All thanks to you, <<1>>.",""
"55049764-0-3752","Win the duel, and I will listen. I value two things: gold and honor.n nFor today, at least, I have the luxury of valuing honor over gold.",""
"55049764-0-3753","Begone. I have no use for self-righteous fools. Sound the drum if you wish to fight.",""
"55049764-0-3754","For a moment there, I feared my faith was already proven false. Much hinges on your involvement, but fate has decreed that you will run this race … and that you will win. nnAre you willing to test this?",""
"55049764-0-3755","We're knights, you know. Veterans. Not scared. nnBut you  be careful down there.",""
"55049764-0-3756","This poor soul doesn't have much time. His blood, it's boiling. nnThat bite must have infected him. Even Faolchu wasn't capable of this.",""
"55049764-0-3757","I've learned all I can here. Time to find Sir Lanis. nnGood luck.",""
"55049764-0-3758","You've done what I thought was impossible. Brinarch the Briar Heart is slain.nnI've put out a call to my sisters for us to retake the <<1>>, now that the Reachmen's leader is dead.",""
"55049764-0-3759","Fear not. They do not command the strength of their master. You must slay them and hope their spirit is strong enough to part with their flesh.nnThey suffer more by living than they would if they died by your hand.",""
"55049764-0-3760","I hope Sorick was happy to hear the news.nnI, on the other hand, have been passing the time chatting to our new friend here. It's rather depressing. I hope the healers get to one of us soon.",""
"55049764-0-3761","What … what madness is this? I'm once again among the living. That can mean only one thing: intruders in Farwatch.nnElves, no less? But you are no elf. What is happening here? Speak quickly!",""
"55049764-0-3762","You have disguise? You killed warchiefs for <<1>>?",""
"55049764-0-3763","You have stepped onto a predetermined path. Fate decrees a duneripper will consume your bones before the end of the day. Deny fate. Slay Istraga.nnThen bring me one of her scales as proof of your victory.",""
"55049764-0-3764","If the fortifications don't hold, then the wounded won't have time to fall back to the ships.",""
"55049764-0-3765","Very curious. <<1>> is a changed man.nnPerhaps he'll realize that with his new apparent strength and physique, he can be more than just a mere servant.",""
"55049764-0-3766","I didn't think I'd run into you again, especially out here in this desert.nnTo think I traded one life of servitude for another! I suppose it's really all I know.",""
"55049764-0-3767","Your pack looks heavy, <<1>>!nnDid you find the tablets?",""
"55049764-0-3768","Thank Stendarr you're here, <<1>>.nnThe bones of the necromancers who died at the <<2>> are giving me no end of trouble.",""

"55049764-0-3771","<<1>>, is it? <<2>> mentioned you were helping us.nnAnd now you're in his hunting ground. I hope your luck with Hircine's game is better than mine.",""
"55049764-0-3772","What's happened? Some of the people in town are acting strangely.",""

"55049764-0-3775","I wouldn't take on that abomination without first dealing with its totems. But I'm sure you know your business better than I do. nnDon't worry about me. I'll find Sir Lanis and the others.",""

"55049764-0-3783","Thank you for the potion. It is helping. Maybe I shouldn't be so quick to distrust these people just because of what Caithe did.",""

"55049764-0-3807","<<1>> is much safer with <<2>> dead. You've done a good thing.",""
"55049764-0-3808","Take care. The princess should realize the importance of the blessing she was given, not only for her sake, but all of us.",""
"55049764-0-3809","I'm sick with worry for everyone trapped down there with the Reachmen.",""
"55049764-0-3810","Stendarr wants you to go to Jackdaw Cove, my friend. You'll find the cove is closer to the Reach than we are, and it may be in more danger.nnI'm sure <<1>> will be able to clear out the Reachmen here, especially after all you've done to help.",""
"55049764-0-3811","<<1>> is waiting to hear the fates of the trolls' quarry.nnHis home is just down the road. Go speak to him.",""

"55049764-0-3821","Oh no! The fact that he is not with you does not bode well. Did you find anything? Was he dead? What about the supply pack?",""
"55049764-0-3822","Look at all those weapons!nnYou actually did it. I can hardly believe my eyes!",""
"55049764-0-3823","<<1>> has asked me to repair the broken rain catchers.nnCan you protect me while I work?",""

"55049764-0-4412","I got word of what you did in <<1>>. Pushing back the Dominion like that. Impressive work.",""
"55049764-0-4413","You were right … about everything. My wife is as dead as she ever was. It was all simply a lie.",""

"55049764-0-4424","Veloth's hammer allows Vox to strip away the souls of those she slays and imprison them in her misty realm. They lose their memories and grant her almost divine power.nnTo challenge Vox, you need to set those souls free.",""
"55049764-0-4425","I don't understand why you're here, but there must be a reason. nnI need time. Give me time to think. Speak to my companions.",""
"55049764-0-4426","I … I have feeling in my hands again. My memories. What … what happened to me?nnThe Tribunal sent you to free me, didn't they? I knew they would not forsake me to be damned to this place.",""

"55049764-0-4438","In one thing, <<1>> was correct. You are no true Shadowscale. With the traitor revealed, your time here must end.nnBut I require one final service, one last judgment. You shall set my children into motion.",""

"55049764-0-4797","It will take time to clean up the mess the Dominion dryskins made of our homes.",""
"55049764-0-4798","I can't believe I missed the whole battle with the Daggers.nnWho am I supposed to fight now? Dark Elf nobles? They can't fight for bull stool, and when you hit them, all they do is whine.",""
"55049764-0-4799","You upheld my honor and the honor of Windhelm. This Ebonheart Pact is worth more than I hoped.nnMay all your enemies fall before you!",""
"55049764-0-4800","Do as I say. Leave this place.nnYou can't rescue the Keepers. They don't need to be rescued, since they no longer exist.",""

"55049764-0-5864","Good thing the captain spotted pirates on our approach. If she hadn't turned us when she did, we'd be decorating the bottom of the bay.",""

"55049764-0-5891","Quality goods. No questions. Get you something?",""
"55049764-0-5892","The crew of the Albatross knows what you did. If the Queen's Own Navy takes us in, we'll make certain everyone else knows, too.",""
"55049764-0-5893","Seems to be no end to this conflict. Cutting the head off the snake would help our cause tremendously.",""

"55049764-0-5911","Don't let the priest bore you, my friend. And ask Shazah if you have any questions about this Moon Hallowed business. This one's just happy she understood what her sister was talking about.",""

"55049764-0-5919","Those fools thought they were necromancers. But in their ignorance, they killed and raised everyone inside this facilitynot just those condemned to die. If this place wasn't so well hidden, its effects could've spread to <<1>> itself.",""
"55049764-0-5920","We will see you in Rawl'kha, Hallowed.nnAnd if she is feeling kind, Shazah will fill in Khali on all she has missed.",""

"55049764-0-5926","You made a fool's decision! Did you not see the horror this thing unleashed?",""
"55049764-0-5927","The cultists are inside the ruins but we cannot follow. The doorway is sealed. nnThere seems to be a connection between the welkynd stones here and the spirits that guard the gateway.",""

"55049764-0-5934","I guess I'm lucky I never made it into the quarantine. But you know, I don't feel very lucky. I guess I do have the plague ….",""
"55049764-0-5935","Time to head back to Skyrim. I want to see the snow one more time before this plague kills me.",""
"55049764-0-5936","I don't believe it. There must be some mistake. The Maulborn want to help us. They said they were here to do good.",""
"55049764-0-5937","I wish I hadn't been right about the Maulborn. I really wanted there to be a cure for this cursed plague.",""
"55049764-0-5938","I hope that's Yngrel's blood I see on you!",""
"55049764-0-5939","I sense the forest more at peace now.",""

"55049764-0-5958","Funny seeing you here.",""
"55049764-0-5959","You tough. Maybe tough enough for Crucible. Maybe not.",""
"55049764-0-5960","It is good to make profit, especially in times of war. The Dominion will pay a good price for these.",""
"55049764-0-5961","Come join us at the Screaming Mermaid when you get a chance. First drink's on me.",""
"55049764-0-5962","Go away. I got no time for you either.",""
"55049764-0-5963","Welcome back to the Isles, adept. We must be wary. This part of Sheogorath's realm is twisted and corrupt.",""

"55049764-0-6118","What's that in your hands there? Seems you've been busy.",""
"55049764-0-6119","The Sergeant can complain and shout all he wants. With that wound, he won't be doing any more fighting today.",""
"55049764-0-6120","If it's not Goblins, it'll be something else tomorrow. I swear this town is cursed.",""
"55049764-0-6121","Go forth and know that Daggerfall and the crown stands behind you.",""

"55049764-0-6137","You come to destroy my master?nnI know what you seek. I would tell you a simple riddle, yet you already have the answer in your posession. That rune you hold is the key to releasing me. The living flesh holds the riddle answer no longer.",""

"55049764-0-6150","Excellent! I can't wait to present this to King Fahara'jad. I'm sure he'll put it to good use!",""

"55049764-0-6203","I think I might join the Fighters Guild. See the world, have some adventures.",""
"55049764-0-6204","Damn my luck! I chose the wrong time to come home from Greenshade.",""
"55049764-0-6206","Be wary. Drusilla is powerful. You will need all your cunning to overcome her.",""
"55049764-0-6207","This time of year, I'm always worried about the harvest. It's a race to get the food to market before it rots.",""
"55049764-0-6208","I guess we actually did it. The Daggers saved the day. Sort of.",""
"55049764-0-6209","Be careful. Foul magic taints the air. Perhaps your learned friend can shed some light on this dark mystery and help you to bring an end to its source.",""

"55049764-0-6212","I think this mercenary band might just have a future, after all.",""
"55049764-0-6213","Search the tents around the ruins. <<1>> said she would meet me at the ruins' entry, straight back from the steps.nnTell her not to worry! I will return with Thalmor reinforcements, and drive out these dungy muskarse Sea Vipers!",""

"55049764-0-6218","I can't believe my eyes. The undead are actually receding. For a while there, I thought we were making a last stand here.nnI'm betting it wasn't our brilliant tactics that drove them away though. Conquering Marbruk wasn't their top priority, was it?",""
"55049764-0-6219","This one will remain behind to aid the injured. But you will see Akkhuz-ri again soon.",""

"55049764-0-6314","Marvelous view from up here, don't you think?",""
"55049764-0-6315","A little privacy, please? These are some sensitive materials.",""
"55049764-0-6316","Don't mind Kuzda. She'll be finished soon.",""
"55049764-0-6317","You've done it! You've walked paths in darkness and come out the other side … into the light.",""
"55049764-0-6318","I will admit, Hallowed. The words of the Moon Bishop affected me deeply. But your victory here … the scent of your return to our living world. The dawn of a new day for our allies. It fills my heart with hope.",""

"55049764-0-6327","Good to see Dominion troops in Cropsford. I feel safer with armed Altmer around.",""

"55049764-0-6418","Good luck on many travels, my friend. Am sure we will meet once again.nnI will spend some time with these monks. Their culture is very fascinating. One wonders what one must do to become one?",""
"55049764-0-6419","This business is none of your concern, creature. Leave the Hand where it lies or your end will come even sooner than already foredained.",""
"55049764-0-6420","You're the mortal who's interfered with my creatures in the bog, aren't you? Don't bother to tell me your name. You won't need it if you continue to trouble me.",""
"55049764-0-6421","I always knew it was the guts of the guardian that gave it powers, but I never dreamed it would be so easy to augment those powers. nnDew bugs, thunderbug bellies, and hive seeds. They're everywhere around here!",""
"55049764-0-6422","Unless you have questions of me, I will soon be on my way. We should both search the forest for other signs of Naemon's corruption. nnI fear at some point, we will have to confront Naemon himself.",""
"55049764-0-6423","You've made it through alive. The other Keepers must be dead, then.nnA part of me wishes it were not so.",""
"55049764-0-6424","The moons shine upon you, friend, and your lizard is spared the stewpot! Congratulations!",""
"55049764-0-6425","<The corpse of <<1>> has already begun to decay. It will be unrecognizable in a few days.>",""
"55049764-0-6426","The Stormfists have three supply wagons with them. Set them on fire and we'll send the entire camp into panic!nnThen light the signal fire and find Fildgor. If he finishes whatever foul ritual he's performing, it will mean the end of the kingdom!",""
"55049764-0-6427","Hurry, champion. I can feel my essence slipping away.",""
"55049764-0-6428","Find that Khajiit! I can't believe she'd turn on her own like this!",""
"55049764-0-6429","I have waited for centuries. And waited … and waited. Do you know how boring that can be?nnBut now you are here. Just as Meridia foretold.",""
"55049764-0-6430","I thought we would get to go home after the keystone was found.",""
"55049764-0-6431","I haven't swung my axe once since we got here, and you did all the work. Well at least I'll get paid. Haha.",""
"55049764-0-6432","What I wouldn't do to be in a nice, safe place. A tavern somewhere, maybe. Warm. A pint of ale. Some good company.nnInstead, I'm in Coldharbour. If Molag Bal's minions don't kill me, Skordo surely will.",""
"55049764-0-6433","Wha… what happened? How did I get down here?",""
"55049764-0-6434","I'm very busy. Can't you tell?",""
"55049764-0-6435","Look for Neramo to the north. Just follow the road and look for his tent.",""
"55049764-0-6436","Very few would dare to enter the Prince of Murder's realm of their own choosing. Your action consists of equal parts bravery and stupidity. I think, in this case, that's exactly what we need.nnWe've been waiting for you, planewalker.",""
"55049764-0-6437","You are spikeball champion! This one reminds you that spikeball can be lucrative as a profession, and he would be honored to manage your career.",""
"55049764-0-6438","Who are you? How did you get here? Leave me alone!",""
"55049764-0-6439","Blackheart is dead, but he won't stay that way forever. Let's destroy his skull and prevent him from ever returning.",""
"55049764-0-6440","I'm sorry I lied to you. I … I hope we can still be friends.",""
"55049764-0-6441","Keep running, I'm right behind you!",""
"55049764-0-6442","Well, go on then. No worries, I'll be fine. They haven't made a cage that can hold this knight. Not yet, at any rate.",""
"55049764-0-6443","Oof. Thanks. I don't know how much more of that my ribs could handle.",""
"55049764-0-6444","Praise to Auri-El! The six Elder Scrolls are all in our possession. We must ensure that they remain with us, where they belong!",""
"55049764-0-6445","This is preposterous! Asteril has risked her life for the Dominion more times than I can count. She is one of my best officers.nnI refuse to believe this irresponsible slander until I have spoken with her myself.",""
"55049764-0-6446","If <<1>> survived the Dominion's initial attack, I'm certain he can help.",""
"55049764-0-6447","Spies! There are spies everywhere! And assassins!",""
"55049764-0-6448","Ezbreba is grateful for your kindness.",""
"55049764-0-6449","Name and  blood and bones, Lyris Titanborn!",""
"55049764-0-6450","Isn't he cute? We are going to be closer than ever now.",""
"55049764-0-6451","You've been good for the Shadowscales, outsider. If I'm ever asked to give you our gift, I'd make it quick and painless.",""
"55049764-0-6452","You restored us, outsider. It's like you … unhatched the egg.",""
"55049764-0-6453","I'm glad you councilled Bowenas well. Everyone deserves a second chance.",""
"55049764-0-6454","By Malacath's bloody mace, you did it!",""
"55049764-0-6455","Now you are negotiating with a forest spirit who calls himself a king? With all those floating leaves, Hazazi thinks he looks very silly.nnDo you really think this is going somewhere? Or is it just a waste of time?",""
"55049764-0-6456","The Hist tree will most likely die soon, but I accept your decision. May the scholars' efforts aid you well against Molag Bal.",""
"55049764-0-6457","I appreciate it when a beautiful monster needs something. That usually means you can trust her.nnAt least for a while, anyway.",""
"55049764-0-6458","Now that was a battle worthy of your greatness! Congratulations!",""
"55049764-0-6461","Welcome to Longhaven. Used to be a busier place, before all this trouble with the mist. But we won't let that be an excuse for poor hospitality.",""
"55049764-0-6462","So you made it through the mist. Your will is stronger than I expected.",""
"55049764-0-6463","Reason with this mad Dunmer! You'll have to kill some of the clan, but there are those of us who only want to coexist alongside the living without harm. Wouldn't it be better to have us as allies to call upon?",""
"55049764-0-6464","The amulets are given?",""
"55049764-0-6465","<The statue holds the Gem of Courage.>",""
"55049764-0-6466","I don't know what that well-dressed man just did, but I'm going to bet it's very bad for us.",""
"55049764-0-6467","<This strange contraption is surprisingly heavy and would take several people to move.>",""
"55049764-0-6469","Don't worry. Girin and I will get in there soon enough.nnIn the meantime, keep Indaenir out of trouble.",""
"55049764-0-6470","The kagouti thought themselves clever to coat their tusks with poison, but the Tree knows all. Its roots will soon feed on the kagouti who burned its blood.",""

"55049764-0-6474","Defeat the king and be done with it.",""
"55049764-0-6475","Kill me if you must, Orc. I swear, I will rise from the very grave to make an end of you.",""
"55049764-0-6476","Get this door open, Targoth, and let's end this!",""
"55049764-0-6477","What have I done?",""
"55049764-0-6478","How did you do with those Black Daggers?",""
"55049764-0-6480","Go, Targoth. Aid our warchief.",""
"55049764-0-6481","You've returned. What do you have to report?",""

"55049764-0-6483","See you in <<1>>. Going to lie down in a bit.",""
"55049764-0-6484","Quickly! Secure the gates!nnThe Maormer must not take the city!",""
"55049764-0-6485","Are you … are you from <<1>>? They said they would send help….",""
"55049764-0-6486","If the gods reward hard work, we've got something coming to us!",""
"55049764-0-6487","With a little luck, we'll have this cleared away before the tide comes in.",""
"55049764-0-6488","Never far from trouble, are you?nnWord reached the palace that Aldmeri forces were here, so the king sent me right away. Looked like many of the Elves were already dead. Where did they come from?",""
"55049764-0-6489","How may Manuk be of service? This one has many fine wares.",""
"55049764-0-6490","The prisoner has paid the blood price for his crimes.",""
"55049764-0-6491","You've done a great service to Greenhill. I'd love to talk, but I really have to finish this inventory.",""
"55049764-0-6492","Merani is really improving her archery skills, don't you think?",""
"55049764-0-6493","Sharp claws, this one is very glad Ezreba will stay with us. She is a bright moon in our sky.",""
"55049764-0-6494","Heard what you decided. Glad Ezreba's going to stick around. Like that cat.",""
"55049764-0-6495","You torment me even in death!",""
"55049764-0-6496","Kada wishes you a bright day and pleasant journeys.",""
"55049764-0-6497","You have done us a great service. May the forest always provide for you.",""
"55049764-0-6498","Thalar cannot offer you enough thanks.",""
"55049764-0-6499","Where is Trela? She was supposed to pick up her meats.",""
"55049764-0-6500","The prisoner has paid the blood price for her crimes.",""
"55049764-0-6501","You monster! My murder wasn't enough?",""
"55049764-0-6502","The prisoner has paid the blood price for her crimes.",""
"55049764-0-6503","Necromancy? Beast! Defiler! Arkay hound you to your grave.",""
"55049764-0-6504","The prisoner has paid the blood price for her crimes.",""
"55049764-0-6505","I hate you. I hate you so much. Why would you do this to me?",""
"55049764-0-6506","Did you make it to Haynote?",""
"55049764-0-6507","Well, you got the job done, though you were gentler than I would've been.",""
"55049764-0-6508","I'll never trust the Midnight Union again, I can tell you that.",""
"55049764-0-6509","I can't hold him for long. Go, before he overtakes me. Tell my master we were successful.",""
"55049764-0-6510","Quickly, return to the courtyard. <<1>> must know of our success.",""
"55049764-0-6511","I heard about Bruma. Sounds like Hafza is out of business. Maybe we should give up on this place altogether.",""
"55049764-0-6512","This day has just gone from bad to worse.",""
"55049764-0-6513","Good job in the Haven my friend. That'll make these seas safe for once.",""
"55049764-0-6514","Thanks to you, we'll be able to float the Prowler off this beach at the next high tide.",""
"55049764-0-6515","Ah, to see out of Khajiit eyes again! Zur hates being caged in that dark place.",""
"55049764-0-6516","What are you doing? Kill that thing before it eats me alive!",""
"55049764-0-6517","Hey there. Buy something, for old time's sake?",""
"55049764-0-6518","Hey, good looking. Long time.",""
"55049764-0-6519","Well, now. What brings you to our humble abode?",""
"55049764-0-6520","Well look who's here. The hero of Betnikh! nnIf you've come to recruit me, I must decline. I'm done sailing, and there's a rich Breton noble over there who could really use a friend.nnTake care of yourself.",""
"55049764-0-6521","Fancy meeting you here. Glad to see you doing well. This is a class above the Screaming Mermaid, I'll give it that.",""
"55049764-0-6522","Now you're a welcome sight!nnI'd chat, but Captain Marck has me testing all the rigging before we set sail again. I'd imagine the debacle at Koeglin Lighthouse made him a bit more cautious.",""
"55049764-0-6523","Well look who it is. Well met, my friend!",""
"55049764-0-6524","Oh, it's you. Yeah, I'm not interesting in talking. Go bug Mekag.",""
"55049764-0-6525","I had not expected to see you again! I'm glad you're still alive.nnIt was a hard choice, staying with Kaleen or Lambur. Ultimately, I'm doing more serving Fahara'jad than I would as a sword for hire.",""
"55049764-0-6526","If it isn't my fine partner from our expedition in Betnikh.",""
"55049764-0-6527","I think I'm just about done with Neramo. All we've done since I joined him is talk about expeditions, not actually join any.nnStill, a berth is a berth. I'll stay with Captain Marck until I find something better.",""
"55049764-0-6528","You! Get out of here. I don't want to see you ever again!",""
"55049764-0-6529","Well met, my friend. You look well.",""
"55049764-0-6530","Well now, a familiar face. How good to see you. Honestly, I'm beginning to wonder if I'm on the wrong ship.",""
"55049764-0-6531","We're here! Daggerfall! At last!nnNow I just need to convince Telonil that a cafe is the right investment.",""
"55049764-0-6532","My friend, good to see you! See this hand? It works again. Found a very talented healer in Aldcroft who put the bones right back together.nnI've put my sword through a few Elves since. Felt good.",""
"55049764-0-6533","Well now, look who it is. The hero of Betnikh.nnI'd wondered if we'd see you again some day. Guess I was right. Lambur owes me dinner.",""
"55049764-0-6534","Oh, it's my dear, brave friend from Stros M'Kai. What a pleasure to see you again.",""
"55049764-0-6535","You are brave to face Kaleen once more. I am glad you have come. She needs more around her who are not blinded by patriotism.",""
"55049764-0-6536","Ah. I erect the spine of respect.",""
"55049764-0-6537","Turn back. You aren't welcome here.",""
"55049764-0-6539","I heard what you said about Grida. Is it true?",""
"55049764-0-6540","Thank you again. I am very much looking forward to returning to my wife.nnI hope she will be as happy to see me.",""
"55049764-0-6541","Thank you, again …  I hope you understand my confusion. I have waited and mourned so long.nnI feel I should be angry at him, but I am just … I am just so happy right now.",""
"55049764-0-6542","Never seen you here before. Just got drafted? What'll you have?",""
"55049764-0-6543","Thank you again. I had forgotten what it feels like to feel free.",""
"55049764-0-6544","No idea what to do with this horse. Fertilizer, perhaps?",""
"55049764-0-6545","Sylvain's fertilizer always doubles my yield. And it smells like roses to boot. Just between you and me, I sometimes roll around in it before spreading it in the field. Sure beats taking my monthly bath.",""
"55049764-0-6546","One day I'll escape from this blasted temple. I'll scour all of Tamriel until I find you. Then, I'll turn you into a hat.",""
"55049764-0-6547","I have given you your reward, you have no more business with me.",""
"55049764-0-6548","Greetings and welcome to the Mages Guild Hall! What is it that you have there?",""
"55049764-0-6550","If you found me, someone else will. I will be ready.",""
"55049764-0-6551","That doll was my only toy as a child. We had hundreds of adventures together. Being reunited with her has brought me more joy than you can imagine.",""
"55049764-0-6552","I fear that justice would have been better served by my death. nnI pray your judgment does not prove to be a mistake for the future of the Covenant.",""
"55049764-0-6553","If you're lost, Cropsford is northeast of here. If you hit Drakelowe Keep, you've gone too far.",""
"55049764-0-6554","If you see Niro again, tell himvery politely, pleasethat I'll handle it. He doesn't need to worry, and he certainly doesn't need to come here and see me.",""
"55049764-0-6555","I hoped Hisham would be with you, if I saw you again. Fool is still clinging to his dream of farm life.",""
"55049764-0-6556","When I went to sea with Captain Kaleen, I didn't expect it to be quite so lonely. I miss my home. I wonder if I made the right choice.nnStill, I'm staying with Lambur. I took this path, and I won't step aside now.",""
"55049764-0-6557","You know, it's strange how memories keep coming back to me. When we first arrived in Wayrest, I didn't remember it at all. Now I'm remembering all sorts of things.nnI think I've found a place here with Captain Marck. I owe that to you.",""
"55049764-0-6558","We've a lot to do, rebuilding the camp. But it beats having our innards ripped out by Daedra.",""
"55049764-0-6559","It's a relief to study without the constant demands from the Covenant military. I could not care less about Cyrodiil and Emeric's damned war.",""
"55049764-0-6560","The Crowns have been pushing King Fahara'jad. They seek to ban any Guild member that studies in Eyevea from working with the military. It's just as well, if you ask me.",""
"55049764-0-6561","Ah, wayfarer. Eyevea is like a dream come true! Especially the tradescraft! It's so easy to gather spell components! Do you have any idea how expensive it is to import frost herbs through to Alik'r desert?",""
"55049764-0-6562","A centralized, readily accessible, and above all neutral port for every nation in Tamriel. Research aside, the trading opportunities here are amazing!",""
"55049764-0-6563","You know, if the Guild plays its cards right …. Just think of all the coin we could make in trade. We could find ourselves in a very good position. If the Cyrodiil situation ever stabilizes, of course.",""
"55049764-0-6564","High King Emeric knows well how to play the diplomat. While officially he's been neutral on the topic of Eyevea, he's privately been highly supportive. He knows Guildmaster Vanus values his friendship.",""
"55049764-0-6565","Guildmaster Vanus asked me personally to come! Said he wanted to be sure our kin were represented in the heart of the guild. Can you imagine?",""
"55049764-0-6566","Hah! This place is amazing! Some High Elf just got done telling me, where she comes from, they respect their Mages. Coming to Eyevea feels like coming home.",""
"55049764-0-6567","Me maw cried when I left to come here. Said I'd been stolen by Elves and wizards, and that I'd end up a slave in Oblivion. Hah! As if I could ever be a Daedra's slave!",""
"55049764-0-6568","Ah, a civilized magical society. I've put so many faces to names I've only seen in letters. It will be nice to speak frankly about our craft. And not be the ""town seer"". Hah!",""
"55049764-0-6569","I've heard the whispers, seen the looks. Some think us Nords are a poor fit for magic. I say, clearly someone has to keep the rest of these fools in line. Hah!",""
"55049764-0-6570","Ahh, adept! This morning I got into an argument with one of those shortie Elves. He was arguing that magic is the most efficient solution to any problem. So I punched him in the face!nnWe're going for drinks later. I like this place.",""
"55049764-0-6571","I would have thought Eyevea's return would call out more of our brethren from House Telvanni. But no. Perhaps someday this neutral ground will help draw them back into the fold.",""
"55049764-0-6572","The Tribunal takes a longer view on the conflicts in Cyrodiil. The Three approve of our presence on Eyevea. Sotha Sil himself hopes for a chance to visit, I hear!",""
"55049764-0-6573","The centuries of hatred between my people and … most of Tamriel seems somehow petty in a place like this. There's so much to be gained through collaboration. Perhaps one day, Dark Elves will walk proudly in the lands outside Morrowind.",""
"55049764-0-6574","A secluded island, just for Mages, where we can all do our work in peace. Free from the outside world's politics and horrors. Really? No one else sees this gilded tree for its rotten roots?",""
"55049764-0-6575","My colleagues think this place is far too good to be true. I'm hopeful. I choose to let the river take us where it wants.",""
"55049764-0-6576","This experiment is doomed to failure, mark my words. You've seen the Dark Elves here, right? ""All Mages are equals"" is a bitter root in my mouth.",""
"55049764-0-6577","This one is so happy to be here! Such an excellent idea. And such delightful fragrances! Sharp claws and Bright Moons to you, adept-who-has-made-this-happen.",""
"55049764-0-6578","Eyevea was a myth, told to tiny Mage cubs. Now you have reached into the past, and legend, and pulled it into the real world. More nonsense like this sounds like an excellent idea!",""
"55049764-0-6579","This one hears others worry about how long Eyevea will last. What does it matter? Gain everything you can now, and worry about whether it will last later. Spend time worrying and you waste the time you have.",""
"55049764-0-6580","Eyevea is ideally placed. A remote but accessible location for the elite to congregate. Well away from the chaos of mainland Tamriel. If you ask me, this is a long overdue asset for the Guild.",""
"55049764-0-6581","Fivefold venerations, adept. All of our people feel great pride in Valaste, for the role she played in your adventure. In her name, High Elves across Tamriel plan to donate tomes to Eyevea's library.",""
"55049764-0-6582","Stars above, Eyevea is a High Elven dream. We gain all the benefits of collaboration with the other races without having to … you know. Actually leave the Summerset Isles. Ideal!",""
"55049764-0-6583","I love this place! I can actually get into real, lively debates about arcano-magical phenomenon. Nobody ""defers to my wisdom"" or tries to change the subject.nnA Nord even hit me. Amazing!",""
"55049764-0-6584","Being here is quite invigorating, adept. I've been a Greenspeaker for so long …. I'd forgotten you could cast spells to harness fire, or change the weather, or even summon an angry Daedra. Amazing!",""
"55049764-0-6585","After living deep in the Valenwood all my life, it's such a difference to be here on Eyevea. I can see the sky, smell the sea air … I didn't expect allergies, though. Something about these mushrooms …. Choo!",""
"55049764-0-6586","I can't believe you let her stay. The Green damn you, traveler! A cancer at the heart of our wood.",""
"55049764-0-6587","Comrade. It is good to speak with you again.",""
"55049764-0-6588","Just leave me to die. I wouldn't accept your help and you'd be better off not offering.",""
"55049764-0-6589","Thank you for the sand. Sometimes, after a long day, I miss my life with Rasha. Travelling where our whims took us, living by our swords, seeing exciting places every day. But the Way of the Sword is no longer my path.",""
"55049764-0-6590","This one has heard reports. You've kept busy. Good! You fit in now more than ever. nnHow did things go?",""
"55049764-0-6591","So, have you decided to help us against the evil Wood Elves?",""
"55049764-0-6592","As far as I can tell, the lamias and the Wood Elves don't get along very well. Even though the snake thing saved me, I'm not sure we can trust either of them.nnStill, they may be your best chance for finding a way into this tower.",""
"55049764-0-6593","Kazirra will be very interested in hearing about all this.",""
"55049764-0-6594","The people of Arenthia owe you a great debt, traveler. You will always be welcome within the walls of our city. But your tale does not end here, I think.",""
"55049764-0-6595","You! Yes, you! <<1>> needs you, immediately!",""
"55049764-0-6596","This is an outrage! I demand <<1>> be taken into custody!",""
"55049764-0-6597","We'll take the marines with us when we sail to <<1>>. I hope to see you there.",""
"55049764-0-6598","Any luck securing a copy of the treaty?",""
"55049764-0-6599","The Dominion must understand our position. The free people of <<1>> cannot make enemies with one hand and friends with the other.",""
"55049764-0-6600","She's going to stay. I can't believe you and Bowenas believe she can change! Once you've touched that kind of darkness. The Green take you both!",""
"55049764-0-6601","It doesn't matter. The tempest is coming. Nothing can stop it, not even … her.",""
"55049764-0-6602","<<1>>'s inside resting. You have five minutes.",""
"55049764-0-6603","Ambassador <<1>> isn't here. And if he was, he'd be far too busy to entertain the likes of you.",""
"55049764-0-6604","Is it over? We can stay? I almost find it had to believe.nnThank you though. You have no idea how much.",""
"55049764-0-6605","If you've come to tell me I'm going to lose my leg, just turn around and leave.",""
"55049764-0-6606","Balag noticed that you are still here. I can help you with something more?",""
"55049764-0-6607","What have we here? Another would-be champion? nnLet me guess. You've come to honor us with a display of prowess mere mortals could only dream of possessing.",""
"55049764-0-6608","There's so much more to learn about Ayleid wells. Unlocking their mysteries will lead to greater understanding of the Ayleids themselves, I'm sure.",""
"55049764-0-6609","The privy is back beyond the gate. Or did you need something else?",""
"55049764-0-6610","Hello my lovely. This is quite the year for talent, as well as beauty.",""
"55049764-0-6611","Thank Akatosh you found my new robes. If I heard another joke about my ""holey robes,"" I think I would have stabbed someone.",""
"55049764-0-6612","Take a tip, friend. Don't stay long in Bruma.",""
"55049764-0-6613","I have digging to do and you're in my way.",""
"55049764-0-6614","Who is this, now? A paying customer, here to cheer on the combatants? Or are you something more?",""
"55049764-0-6615","There's no way I can properly thank you for what you've done. This is the first good luck my clan's had in months. This means we can stay here and start over.nnWherever you go, and whatever you do, you'll always be a champion of the Driladan.",""
"55049764-0-6616","I can't afford to wait here much longer. I came to help assist those fleeing the darkness in the forest, but very few have come this way.nnI hope this does not mean they have all simply perished.",""
"55049764-0-6617","My silver flute has a much sweeter tone than the one I've been using. I'll be able to lift some spirits with this in hand!",""

"55049764-0-6619","Thought I was ruined, but that <<1>> says <<2>> will pay for the kwama to live in that cave.nnI'm not above taking coin from crazy folk. Might even be enough to repair my ship!",""
"55049764-0-6620","Well, you're back but I know what you're going to say, so don't bother. Cousin Asvorn won't give me any more money. That smug, cheap bastard.",""

"55049764-0-6622","You honor me with your presence, walker.",""
"55049764-0-6623","If you touched anything, you'll answer to me.",""
"55049764-0-6624","A great wind blew, and many ships were dashed against Khenarthi's island. But you strengthened the Great Tree, despite her anger! <<1>> thrives once more.nnMay your actions show Khenarthi our goal is righteous. May she bless us with favorable winds.",""
"55049764-0-6625","My no-good cousin's not getting any more gold out of me!",""

"55049764-0-6627","MmmMMmmf MMMF!",""
"55049764-0-6628","Please let me know if you find anything. Even if it's just something that confirms she's gone, knowing would be better than this.",""
"55049764-0-6629","Why are you wasting time? My father did not instruct you to relax here and then go after the Withered Hand ….nnYou are Ash'abah now. You have a job to do. Go to Tu'whacca's Throne. We will see each other again soon enough.",""
"55049764-0-6630","The Wood Elves have fallen. My eggs shall be returned to my nest and my people shall be safe.nnThe Shadow Walkers shall be lost without their leaders. The day is ours!",""
"55049764-0-6631","So you've returned! I thank you again for your help in the Hollow. Dracien and Bakkhara are lost, but I am pleased we remain to tell their stories.",""
"55049764-0-6632","I hope Hannura appreciated the fish. I like to send her some as often as I can.",""
"55049764-0-6633","Plenty of salvage in a town like this"," think I'll stick around for a while longer. That dead messenger will slow Marcellus down."
"55049764-0-6634","The fish you brought will make a nice meal. Perhaps I should invite some friends over to share.",""
"55049764-0-6635","I know this may not be the way you would normally deal with a problem, but it's the only way to make my clan trust you.nnNow, let's go and cause as much chaos as we can!",""
"55049764-0-6636","Begone, bandit. I'll never join <<1>>!",""
"55049764-0-6637","This one … feels odd.",""
"55049764-0-6638","I hope Jafola makes it out of Bruma alive. That town's a sinking ship.",""
"55049764-0-6639","Saldir becomes less reliable all the time. I need to find a new supplier. The wounded here can't wait for Saldir to saunter into town.",""
"55049764-0-6640","I quiver like a leaf in the wind to think of what we'll learn from these ruins.nnWe'll be careful, of course. It would be unfortunate to allow something like this to happen again.",""

"55049764-0-6642","What did you see in that temple? I heard it's full of watery spirits!",""
"55049764-0-6643","So much destruction! Thank goodness you were here to help rebuild the ship!",""
"55049764-0-6644","Greetings, O my friend. You are most welcome in our home. Without your intervention, the city might well have been lost.",""
"55049764-0-6645","The docks have been reclaimed?  We are so grateful. nnMy father is a kind-hearted man, and without imports the city would starve. I wish the Crowns could see that.",""
"55049764-0-6646","Tu'whacca bless you. Some may name you heretic for striking our risen dead, but in this house you are a hero. Be welcome.",""
"55049764-0-6647","It is our duty as Ash'abah to assist the king if he calls upon us. I only wish he had called on us earlier. nnPerhaps this terrible poisoning could have been avoided.",""
"55049764-0-6649","I heard rumors of rats and all manner of lunacy in the Mad God's chateau. How dreadful! We're glad to have you back in Tamriel, safe and sound. Do you need to restock on any provisions?",""
"55049764-0-6650","Cordial greetings and welcome to our toweran isle of knowledge amidst a vast sea of ignorance.  nnHave you come for training?",""
"55049764-0-6651","Well met. I'm the resident librarian. We don't have much, but what we have I care for. nnHave you found anything to add to our collection?",""
"55049764-0-6652","Greetings. You stand in the Sentinel Mages Guildhall.  nnThis one is curious: what do you have there?",""
"55049764-0-6653","I believe Talia has finished … mixing the potion for your initiation. Speak to her when you are ready to begin the trial.nnMay Tu'whacca guide your path, initiate … always.",""
"55049764-0-6654","Welcome, wayfarer. Your exploits on the docks are known to me, but I know that your ways are not our ways. nnYou may sit and take rest in our hall, however, and partake of our services.",""
"55049764-0-6655","The sacred relics of Mara  are they safe? Have you got them?",""
"55049764-0-6656","The Stone Table. Quickly!",""
"55049764-0-6657","This business at the docks gets worse by the hour. If those shambling dungpiles come much farther up the beach we may have to do something about it.",""
"55049764-0-6658","Go. Exit  through the pit and help Indanas defeat the Hollow Lord.",""
"55049764-0-6659","Even if I can save some of these wounded, the Imperials will just kill them another time.",""
"55049764-0-6660","To Oblivion with kwama egg mining. I've worked out a deal with Shatasha to rent the ruins to the Mages Guild for research. nnIf that lost city is as big as she says it is, I should be well-off for quite a while.",""
"55049764-0-6661","We fought well, didn't we? I think we might just have a chance at turning this disaster into a successful operation.",""
"55049764-0-6662","You look much better now! Make sure to tell <<1>> old <<2>> took good care of you.",""
"55049764-0-6663","I should really attend to my patients. <<1>> can tell you what you need to know, if you can put up with his attitude.",""
"55049764-0-6664","You heard Sangur. Get going.nnI'm sure I'll be around when you return.",""
"55049764-0-6665","What happened?",""
"55049764-0-6666","Don't judge me. I had a moment of weakness. It won't happen a third time, I promise!",""
"55049764-0-6667","Next time I'm given a mission, you know I'll come looking for you. Be ready, my friend.",""
"55049764-0-6668","Ho there! Can't let you in here.",""
"55049764-0-6669","It's about time you got up. Father is about to give his big speech.",""
"55049764-0-6670","Oh, hey. Look, you really need to move on. I just need a break, that's all.",""
"55049764-0-6671","Is there anything I could get you? A drink? A little bit of my time?",""
"55049764-0-6672","Hey, thanks for the ale! Don't let me catch you around here again, or something.",""
"55049764-0-6673","Go on, use the portal and get out of here. We'll wait a few more moments for any stragglers that want to escape.",""
"55049764-0-6674","You seem determined to make yourself useful. What strange habits you mortals have.",""
"55049764-0-6675","You're a fool, and you've doomed another fool to unspeakable torment.nnIt's no longer my concern. I'll depart this world soon enough.",""
"55049764-0-6676","This war will kill us all, I feel it in my bones.",""
"55049764-0-6677","Do you have my ring?",""
"55049764-0-6678","It'll be tough going without the Captain. Command never really suited me.",""
"55049764-0-6679","You rescued me from a fate worse than death. I owe you, friend.",""
"55049764-0-6680","Welcome.",""
"55049764-0-6681","I have no idea why <<1>> would seal himself into that creature's tomb.nnBut I suppose he won't be around to undermine my experiments. Hmm!",""
"55049764-0-6682","You're a true hero.  Everyone in this company owes you their lives.",""
"55049764-0-6683","I didn't think we were going to make it.  Thank you.",""
"55049764-0-6684","There, you see? You fit in and no one will stop you from walking away. But, as this one said, there are opportunities here for people that fall from the sky.",""
"55049764-0-6685","You saved many lives today.  Azsu will remember you.",""
"55049764-0-6686","A shame the shrine is no longer kindled since the spirit departed. <<1>> will remain here for a little bit, in case the flame returns.",""
"55049764-0-6687","I hear you've done good work, recruit. Once we're off this island, I'll put your name in for a medal.",""
"55049764-0-6688","This conflict could have been avoided.",""
"55049764-0-6689","Speak of Namiira. Our specialist!nn<<1>> was just commenting on the difficulties pests present to any plantation. We'll be rid of these vermin in short order, yes? Of course, yes.",""
"55049764-0-6691","Oh! One more thingAndur scouted out the Orcs' Camp pretty extensively. He might have some useful observations if you ask.nnGood luck with the Wood Orcs … and that tricky treethane. Maybe we'll meet again when we find the Wilderking.",""
"55049764-0-6692","I really don't want to cover myself in this stuff.",""
"55049764-0-6693","You seem to be rather sharp, so I will not pretend that everything is all right.nnThe king is dealing with a crisis that threatens his hold on the throne. I would not bother him unless you are willing to help.",""
"55049764-0-6694","I'm still a little banged up, but we'll do our best to rally the troops and meet you upstairs.",""
"55049764-0-6695","Quite the view from up here, don't you think?nnIf only the company was equally enjoyable.",""
"55049764-0-6697","If this works, I'll owe the gods an apology. Fill the blood rune and then use it on the three seals.nnAfter that, we'll have to deal with the Binding Pool. Hopefully, I'll have figured this out by then. I'll meet you up at the gate to the pool.",""
"55049764-0-6698","Gone … father is gone. Why would <<1>> destroy his own family?nnPlease, leave me to my sorrow.",""
"55049764-0-6699","<<1>> knows you'll succeed.nnYou hear that, lazy senche? This one could replace the lot of you with <<cm:2>>!",""
"55049764-0-6700","It seems Akkhuz-ri may have hope here. Kazirra mentioned forgiveness, and perhaps helping to rebuild Arenthia will aid this one in atonement.",""
"55049764-0-6701","Well, that was more exciting than Tarrami anticipated!",""
"55049764-0-6702","I've never been more scared. I can't believe <<1>> wants to execute us.",""
"55049764-0-6703","I'm still shaking. <<1>> gave us the death penalty.",""
"55049764-0-6705","Leave me be. The loss of my brother is … difficult to bear.",""
"55049764-0-6706","Good luck and all that nonsense.",""
"55049764-0-6707","We're all so grateful to you for freeing us. We were in over our heads.",""
"55049764-0-6708","Nice to see Fort Rayles in Dominion hands. I feel safer already.",""
"55049764-0-6709","You were born under sign of the Lady, weren't you? I can always tell. Buy me a drink, gorgeous?",""
"55049764-0-6710","I should really go check on my father.",""
"55049764-0-6711","Thanks! I'm getting out of here!",""
"55049764-0-6712","I came here to get away from the war. But I see you and the Dominion have brought it to my doorstep.",""
"55049764-0-6713","Yes, yes, the Dominion has taken Fort Rayles. Makes no difference to me. You all track in the same amount of dirt.",""
"55049764-0-6714","This one rejoices that Fort Rayles is in Dominion hands. Honor to you for any part you played in this!",""
"55049764-0-6715","It's about time the Pact took Fort Rayles. Be nice to see new faces in town.",""
"55049764-0-6716","You must leave the moment you are ready. The Ansei Wards are gone and the Withered Hand has already taken to the desert winds. Go now and mete out the king's justice.",""
"55049764-0-6717","Speak to my fellow elders and state your case.nnWe will convene when you are done to discuss our options.",""
"55049764-0-6718","Good to see you here. With the Pact in Fort Rayles, I hope things settle down around here. I could use the rest.",""
"55049764-0-6719","Welcome! Saw some Pact soldiers heading toward Rayles. I hope to see a lot more Nord faces around here.",""
"55049764-0-6720","Well met, champion. Your deeds on the docks have done the city a service. You take a great risk in striking the Ra-Netu, but perhaps Tu'whacca's curse does not extend to outsiders. Bah! A matter for priests.",""
"55049764-0-6721","So, the Pact took over Fort Rayles. As long as no historical sites were ruined, I don't care who holds that place.",""
"55049764-0-6722","Now that Fort Rayles is in Pact hands, I hope I get some peace and quiet around here.",""
"55049764-0-6723","When is the Covenant going to take back Fort Rayles?",""
"55049764-0-6724","About time the Covenant started showing up. Fort Rayles needs to be retaken!",""
"55049764-0-6725","For the honor of the Covenant, Fort Rayles must be retaken!",""
"55049764-0-6726","For the honor of the Covenant, Fort Rayles must be retaken!",""
"55049764-0-6727","Why hasn't Fort Rayles been retaken? Has the Covenant no more swords?",""
"55049764-0-6728","A lapse in control leads to smugglers brewing skooma. If there's reason, I'll recommend Headwoman <<1>> shut this plantation down.",""
"55049764-0-6729","This one never thought you could best Tholbor, Zara, and Malarel. She is looking forward to ending your lucky streak.",""
"55049764-0-6730","I hear you're looking for some special substance. Some scuma?",""
"55049764-0-6731","Apparently my husband Farrokh does not know how to bar a door. We dare not go out while our ancestors still walk. nnI have asked Tu'whacca for intercession. All we have is prayer now.",""
"55049764-0-6732","Walk with care. Tu'whacca's will has been defied at the docks, and his vengeance will be terrible indeed.",""
"55049764-0-6733","Thank ye, my friend. Ye let me see that preserving life is not worth abandoning it.",""
"55049764-0-6734","You did the right thing.",""
"55049764-0-6735","We're going to start over. We'll build a better life.",""
"55049764-0-6736","Once we control the portal, we can control the first section of the Chasm.",""
"55049764-0-6737","Erunor! I knew ye'd see. I knew ye'd understand.nnThank ye so much.",""
"55049764-0-6738","I wish I could go with you. I'm worried about my companions who've gone inside, but the priestess won't allow me to go in after them.",""
"55049764-0-6739","A magic force bubble? Really? nnThanks for getting my brother out of that mess.",""
"55049764-0-6740","Mara be praised! We truly cannot thank you enough for the return of these relics. Walk with Her blessing, feel Her smile on your face, and know always She will be with you.",""
"55049764-0-6741","How strange this feels! To be simply Zur again is … lonely.",""
"55049764-0-6742","I am grateful that you chose to save me. Still, I feel a bit lost. I wish … I wish Zur was still here.",""
"55049764-0-6743","If you can destroy the four focus stones, then we'll be able to control the portal and hold the first segment of the Chasm.",""
"55049764-0-6744","I'm ready to face anything, even the Dremora guarding this Chasm. But Akatosh preserve me, I have a profound fear of heights.",""
"55049764-0-6745","Make sure you destroy all four focus stones, or this war ends here and now. Our mages can't take control of the portal to the second tier while the stones are active.",""
"55049764-0-6746","The forbidden tomes cannot be allowed to cause more harm. Please, you must bring them to the shrine where they can be destroyed.",""
"55049764-0-6747","Move along, move along. I'd prefer if you didn't dawdle around here.",""
"55049764-0-6748","Move along, soldier. Keep this gate open for new arrivals.",""
"55049764-0-6749","Ah, you return to Zan! The siege range is yours to use, walker. Speak with Firamo or Miniel to refresh your memory of how siege weaponry works.",""
"55049764-0-6750","Covered my tracks. Couldn't have found me!",""
"55049764-0-6751","We came here hoping to establish a Dominion naval base, but our ""forest of sails"" turned into a graveyard.",""
"55049764-0-6753","May Jone and Jode watch over the town of Greenhill, and her people.",""
"55049764-0-6754","I never want to see another ship. I'll stay on this island for the rest of my life, if I have to! They can't force me to go back, can they?",""
"55049764-0-6755","You're going to think I'm wandering in my wits, but I could swear I just saw an Orc run through herewearing nothing but his underclothes!",""

"55049764-0-6882","Thanks unto the Divines for bringing you to Bergama. Dihoq and I were a vulture's wing-beat from poisoning each other!",""
"55049764-0-6883","Well, the King certainly doesn't lack confidence. I can appreciate that. Might put our friend here in his place.nnThat'd be delightful to see.",""
"55049764-0-6884","Tu'whacca's breath, what a relief these kidnapings were solved. nnOf course, the Withered Hand is still out there, so I suppose I should dry my mouth lest I bring a curse on us.",""

"55049764-0-6886","Blasphemy! The Elder Scroll of Mnem has been stolen from our temple. I can tell you of the Elder Scrolls, but you will not feel their holy presence until our scroll returns. Perhaps you can help, once you complete your training.",""
"55049764-0-6887","As you can see, this is a horrible place. They just dump the bodies anywhere, and the predators, these harpies, come to feed on the corpses. nnMy Zariya … she does not deserve this. She has done nothing wrong!",""

"55049764-0-6890","A draft of last year's census went missing just days ago. If my carelessness aided the Withered Hand with these murders … aiyah, I could swallow a sword.",""

"55049764-0-6900","Our Magistrate consorts with defilers of our dead? This is the ultimate betrayal. nnNeed you any more proof that Forebears are not fit to rule?",""
"55049764-0-6901","The Magistrate is the hand of our Forebear king, and she consorts with necromancers? nnFahara'jad's rule continues to bring nothing but ruin.",""
"55049764-0-6902","This talk of war … I thought we were done. We got Vanus back. Why can't we just go home?",""
"55049764-0-6903","Later, mate. I got me some killing to do.",""
"55049764-0-6904","So the Magistrate is to blame for all this kidnaping brouhaha? nnIn a town this brutish and rustic … one sympathizes.",""
"55049764-0-6905","Well? Did you find Klovag? Is he coming?",""
"55049764-0-6906","I have not the heart to look at the names of the dead. My son was so troubled. I had so much I wanted to tell him.",""
"55049764-0-6907","The Maormer are practically beasts. There are stories about them to make the fur stand on end!",""
"55049764-0-6908","I hear you've been helping the fleet recover from the storm. My family owns a shipping line, yet even I would be hard pressed to work so swiftly when the pressure is on. Bravo.",""
"55049764-0-6909","Well done. Our forces will take the sanctuary with little effort now. But we have another problem we could use your help with.",""
"55049764-0-6910","Sounds like you'll be having some fun of your own.",""
"55049764-0-6911","There were survivors? That's great news! I'm sure no one will mind a few dead miners once they see my trolls in action at the arena!",""
"55049764-0-6912","This one misses Kargand so much. He was always able to bring a smile to this Khajiit's face. His death has left a hole in this one's heart.",""
"55049764-0-6913","Long and long I have seen Sulma's sidelong glances, her nervous paper shuffling. This betrayal is not a surprise. nnSadly, I deem her replacement will be no better.",""
"55049764-0-6914","We get invaded, and everybody thinks it's a reason to slack. Not on Tohiba's watch!",""
"55049764-0-6915","Have you seen the Magistrate since her arrest? I suspect she won't live through the night.",""
"55049764-0-6916","Hurry up now! You were the one who said we did not have much time!",""
"55049764-0-6917","This one thinks he is doing better. The voices still speak to Kargand but this Khajiit can ignore them.",""
"55049764-0-6918","So Istah was telling the truth, huh? Don't matter to meso long as our customers stay alive long enough to pay their debts.",""
"55049764-0-6919","Hhmph. Raz is still angry you disobeyed him. But some of the moon priests here have been most informative about dealing with the circlet from Senalana. Some day, Raz may forgive you.",""
"55049764-0-6920","Sulma had no stone in her bones. If the Withered Hand wishes Bergama razed, let them come. By Onsi's bright blade, I will slay ten and ten before I fall.",""
"55049764-0-6921","Thank you for saving us! If you hadn't come along … well. I expect I'll wake up screaming for the next few years.",""
"55049764-0-6922","It is settled. We shall cross the Chasm and make our way to the planar vortex at the heart of Molag Bal's realm.nnNow that you know the plan, I have a special request to make of you.",""
"55049764-0-6923","With the Champions prepared, the Dominion itself begins to heal. We're going to make our way to Dune. The Two Moons Path awaits! I'll see you there, my friend.",""
"55049764-0-6924","Have to hire from Valenwood, find some new dupes to work the delve, and … excuse me! I'm very busy here!",""
"55049764-0-6925","I heard that the Magis … Magit … the, uh, Judge? She's been killing folks? That's a cryin' shame. Better tuck in another pint. Y'know, drowning sorrows … and such.",""
"55049764-0-6926","Good luck, Hallowed. I'm sure I'll see you again soon.",""
"55049764-0-6927","We shall see you at Dune, then. I look forward to our next conversation.",""

"55049764-0-6929","Damn shame about the Magistrate, eh? I heard she might even have been cutting deals with the Withered Hand. nnThe good news is that the next Magistrate might be even worse, so Samhudah's keeping me on the payroll. How's that for a happy ending?",""
"55049764-0-6930","Thank you for not slaughtering my people back in the forest.nnI've decided that I can no longer live like I was. I'm going to join you in your fight. I'm going to get back to Tamriel.",""
"55049764-0-6931","I don't know if I can go further. I'm afraid.",""
"55049764-0-6932","I heard a rumor the Magistrate was feeding the bodies of our departed friends to the risen dead. Tava's red feathers, I can't think of a worse fate than that.",""
"55049764-0-6933","I saw how annoyed she looked! Well done!",""
"55049764-0-6934","That fool has no idea of the danger you have put him in. I can sense the ghosts approaching even now. Tu'whacca forgive him … and you.",""
"55049764-0-6937","So it was the Magistrate who killed all those poor devils? She looks a bit waifish for that sort of work, but I suppose you never can tell. nnUncle Thakh won't be happy, at any rate. The dead rarely pay their debts.",""
"55049764-0-6938","You appeared to enjoy the power I gave you. I, too, know how exhilarating the power of death and darkness can be.nnAll this and more can be yours whenever you want it. If you join me in this campaign.",""
"55049764-0-6939","Did you recover the sword? We must speak before you go further with it.",""

"55049764-0-6945","As if we Forebears weren't hated enough, our Magistrate falls in with Tu'whacca's mortal enemy. nnI am thinking it is better to walk back to Sentinel with a broken sandal than to stay in Bergama much longer.",""
"55049764-0-6946","So the Magistrate was responsible for all this nonsense? My, my, my. What a dreadful development. nnI can't say that I'll miss the attention. Being an outsider while a murdering spree takes place is … unpleasant.",""
"55049764-0-6947","You look like you have something weighing heavy on your mind. Need a good drink to wash it away?",""
"55049764-0-6948","The faster you return with the blood, the faster you get your antidote. And trust me, it's not something you want to put off for too long.",""
"55049764-0-6949","Did you know this town has mead? They'll even feed it to dogs who ask nicely. Good choice, saving these people. Or whatever it is you did. You should've mentioned the mead before.",""
"55049764-0-6950","The hero of the cliffs returns in triumph! I do hope you didn't get too disheveled down there. Fighting alongside the peasants can be rather unpleasant. They really are disgusting creatures.",""
"55049764-0-6951","You descend a hole that only gets deeper and deeper.nnUnlike my opponents and I, you can still leave this place. Yet you linger, hoping that you can somehow save the mortals from the Mages Guild. How curious!",""
"55049764-0-6952","Go to Greenheart. Quickly. There is no time to delay.",""
"55049764-0-6953","And we find ourselves here once again … it's so unnatural. It makes me feel queasy.nnThe Eldest's heart must be the nexus that ties this plane to ours. I suspect it is also tethered to Naemon's Servantthe one who addressed us.",""
"55049764-0-6954","Did you hear? Ranneth wants to make me their town mage! Alanya loves it here. I think it's the mead. I can be a working spellcaster, instead of a failed student! I can do this! And it's all thanks to you. Thank you.",""
"55049764-0-6955","Goodbye now. It's time for me to rest.",""
"55049764-0-6956","Aranias tore open the ground below. You will find her and Andur in tunnels leading to my throne.",""
"55049764-0-6957","Go on. We need to do this before I lose my nerve.",""
"55049764-0-6958","Don't worry about me, I'll figure something out. I suspect this is not the last time we'll see each other.",""
"55049764-0-6961","You have my gratitude  and the esteem of the Eyes of the Queen. That is no small thing.",""
"55049764-0-6962","Our swords have prevailed! All Cyrodiil's forts are in Covenant hands. We have no Warfront missions now, but many others await your attention.",""
"55049764-0-6963","She waits for you atop this tower.nnShe is frightened of what is to come.",""
"55049764-0-6965","Marasadra just tends to the horses. Leave her be.",""
"55049764-0-6967","With <<1>> defeated we may just meet our recruitment quota.",""
"55049764-0-6968","Thank you, for everything. To kill someone in the name of the Pact, wronglyunthinkable! If you hadn't been here, this would have turned out much worse. Thank you.",""
"55049764-0-6969","New around here, aren't you? I advise you to have a talk with <<1>>.",""
"55049764-0-6970","The Elder Scroll of Alma Ruma has been stolen! I can tell you of the Elder Scrolls, but this temple is an empty shell until our scroll returns. Perhaps you can help, when your training is done.",""
"55049764-0-6971","After we talked through our little misunderstanding, Ranneth and I agreed that Pircalmo would make a good town mage. I quite like it here! The mead … so delicious!",""
"55049764-0-6972","With those bandits gone, we finally have enough supplies and equipment for the new recruits.",""
"55049764-0-6973","With those bandits driven out I can keep two eyes on the horizon and not worry about what's happening behind me.",""
"55049764-0-6974","In breaking the Shadows Watch, you saved many lives.",""
"55049764-0-6975","I knew Fahara'jad's appointee was to blame for this. It was only a matter of time before the Divines revealed her treachery. Onsi's blessings be upon our Justice Istah for finally bringing her to account.",""
"55049764-0-6976","Well, these Crowns are not quite as dour as I thought. Tears of Zeht, that wedding looks festive!",""
"55049764-0-6977","Make yourself comfortable, stranger. Everything the Manor of Revelry has to offer is yours for the taking.",""
"55049764-0-6978","Why do these things keep happening to me, I wonder?",""
"55049764-0-6979","You must be starving! Try everything. It's all so delicious. I promise, you've never tasted anything like the food we prepare here.",""
"55049764-0-6980","Our pools are warm and inviting. Feel free to take a nice, long soak.",""
"55049764-0-6981","Stibbons really wants to be a hero. Please help him so he doesn't get himself killed.",""
"55049764-0-6982","If you're here to join up with <<1>>, his day is over. nnAnd if you stick around, so is yours.",""
"55049764-0-6983","You're going to challenge <<1>>? Word of advice, run while you still got legs.",""
"55049764-0-6984","It just figures that <<1>> would get someone else to do his dirty work.",""
"55049764-0-6985","Why doesn't <<1>> just let us run off <<2>> and his militia rats?nnI'm tired of having to tiptoe around them and put up with their sneers.",""
"55049764-0-6986","What are you looking at?",""
"55049764-0-6987","It must be some madness blown in from the south. I wish I could clear my head.nnIt's like I can't remember something that I must!",""
"55049764-0-6988","This one's good-for-nothing brother Munyat sleeps all day, but Raban is happy to help you.",""
"55049764-0-6989","High Elf cooking? No, no. Too dry. Wood Elf cooking? Lacks sweet! You will find no better than <<1>>'s authentic Khajiiti cooking.",""
"55049764-0-6990","This one has traveled Tamriel to bring the finest arcana to you.",""
"55049764-0-6991","I generally find the Khajiit's grasp of knowledge lacking, but I'm impressed.",""
"55049764-0-6992","This one sees you have survived many battles. Buy my armor and survive many battles more, yes?",""
"55049764-0-6993","I hope you brought the key. We're ready to make the final push, but we're finished if we can't get inside.nnThis is our last chance to save our world. It's all or nothing now.",""
"55049764-0-6994","Close that reinforcement portal so that we can send the rest of our forces inside.nnI know you will make me proud!",""
"55049764-0-6995","So it's true then? You have retrieved my bow from the Shade?",""
"55049764-0-6996","Authentic Valenwood hides, certain to protect against Colovian arrows.",""
"55049764-0-6997","I wonder where that worthless boy got to. He should've been back with my herbs by now. Oh, pardon me.",""
"55049764-0-6998","Business is good, if you can keep the Bosmer from stealing everything in sight.",""
"55049764-0-6999","Yazhin complains about thieves, but he leaves his till unlocked.",""
"55049764-0-7000","Spotless woodcraft at fair pricessanded and polished to a mirror sheen.n nCome, look!",""
"55049764-0-7001","These damned cats'll give you tin when you ask for iron. Anything to save a drake. If you're here to do some real metalwork, I'm the orc you can trust.",""
"55049764-0-7002","The Khajiit have suffered much lately, but they are a lively people. They give hope to us all.",""
"55049764-0-7003","Daedra never sleep and neither do we.",""
"55049764-0-7004","The Fighters Guild will secure the line behind you. We won't give up any ground you gain us. Just get in there and open the way to the Labyrinth.",""
"55049764-0-7005","And here comes the great and marvelous Vanus Galerionright on schedule and just in time to take all the credit.nnI think he wants to talk to you.",""
"55049764-0-7006","Let the King know what you decided so we can get this assault underway already!",""
"55049764-0-7007","How odd. I never imagined my warriors would be pitted against the forces of Molag Bal.nnBut have no fear. We are ready to fight when you give the word.",""
"55049764-0-7008","Good drink makes good friends, yes?",""
"55049764-0-7009","She may not believe what we believe, at first. She is my superior within the clergy, and sometimes prideful. But she trusts in the moons. As I do.",""
"55049764-0-7010","It will take more than steel to keep the Colovians at bay.",""
"55049764-0-7011","This one has much to offer. From as far away as the Summerset Islesenchanting and mystical!",""
"55049764-0-7012","That worked? I mean, I knew that would work. Never doubted my calculations.nnUm, good job! The door ahead should be unlocked now.",""
"55049764-0-7013","The darkness is obviously designed to hinder our progress. An interesting conundrum, yes?",""
"55049764-0-7014","And another job performed to perfection by our champion. Well done!nnNow hurry through the open door and find the planar vortex. The end of the world isn't going to wait for you, you know.",""
"55049764-0-7015","His wounds … he's in terrible pain. We tried to heal him … but the damage … it's too extensive.",""
"55049764-0-7016","Well? I see you asking the rest of these daintyfoots for help, but you took your time getting to me.nnWhat am I? Too short for your precious army?",""
"55049764-0-7017","Your king must be informed. Let him know that we are ready to spill blood and defeat your enemies!",""
"55049764-0-7018","Has the time come to sail into the stormy sea? Do we pillage and plunder the domicile of the Lord of Brutality now?nnI'm eager to demonstarte the power of the Bone Crown!",""
"55049764-0-7019","A drunk Nord is worth a dozen of these sober milk-drinkers. Imagine how valuable a sober Nord can be.nnI haven't been in a good brawl in a long time. I'm looking forward to it!",""
"55049764-0-7020","Finally, vengance will be mine. I will make the Prince pay for what he has put me through.",""
"55049764-0-7021","Say the word and we will attack the Dark Father by your side.",""
"55049764-0-7022","We had to abandon everything when the Colovians attacked.",""
"55049764-0-7023","The Khajiit have been surprisingly friendly to us.",""
"55049764-0-7024","I think that Khajiit back there was interested in more than friendly conversation.",""
"55049764-0-7025","We need food if we are going to survive.",""
"55049764-0-7026","Where is Shiri? She should have been back days ago!nnI never should have taken that girl as an apprentice. Untrustworthy! There is something very sneaky about her.",""
"55049764-0-7027","Can you believe <<1>> agreed to join me?nnI've been a one-man act till now, but she's a bright lass and will make a great partner. And, she still holds the key for this chest.",""
"55049764-0-7028","I've been told that Shiri, the scholar's apprentice is on her way back to Bergama, but Scholar Zohreh says she hasn't seen the girl yet.",""
"55049764-0-7029","My fatherdoes he live?",""
"55049764-0-7030","That strange knight says the oddest things. But Vanus and the King seem to trust him, so what can you do?nnYou must be the champion that King Dynar said would lead us across the Chasm.",""
"55049764-0-7031","It is an honor to meet you. Prince Azah has told me of your deeds in Sentinel, and I know you have General Thoda's respect as well.nnWith you here, I think our chances of surviving this have improved tenfold.",""
"55049764-0-7032","May Y'ffre smile on you! You closed the rifts that bound us here! nnYou must stop that Shade though … it seeks to do terrible things to Valenwood. Though I have passed on many years gone now, I still consider Valenwood my home.",""
"55049764-0-7033","I can't believe we got caught up in all of that. I hope Pircalmo understands what it looked like. Thank you for showing up when you did.",""
"55049764-0-7034","I thought you were going to tell that matchmaker to let me off the hook. nnNon-bandits. You can't trust them.",""
"55049764-0-7035","Stop! I yield. I admit defeat.",""
"55049764-0-7036","Magic worries me. I can never quite trust all those mage-types. Maybe things will be different now that we have a town mage.",""
"55049764-0-7037","Get your lizard away from me, stranger!",""
"55049764-0-7038","You look lost"," probably need some training. I can help you out."
"55049764-0-7039","The Green Lady is in Malabal Tor, but rumors of attacks from Redguards have reached us. It's imperative that the Green Lady be kept safe, so that she and the Silvenar may be joined.",""
"55049764-0-7040","This doesn't seem right. Sometimes I wonder if the Vinedusk Rangers understand things more than we do.",""
"55049764-0-7041","We'll talk again in Daggerfall. Look for the loud bunch in the back of the Rosy Lion tavern.nnAssuming you don't die in that cave, of course.",""
"55049764-0-7042","Sorry, friend. I have to get back to my companion.",""
"55049764-0-7043","Valenwood is only alive because of you. We are all in your debt, I especially, and having a Silvenar in your debt can be a good thing.nnI'll be on my way to Malabal Tor now. I will undoubtedly see you there.",""
"55049764-0-7044","Your loyalty to the crown will be rewarded, my friend. You have my word.nnGet in there and free the hostages and then we can go in and spill some Imperial blood.",""
"55049764-0-7045","Well played. I hope Zara wasn't watching. I was hoping she'd pick me to fight in the next division round.",""
"55049764-0-7046","I don't care to make this decision, but I must.",""
"55049764-0-7047","Hail, brother. nnWord has reached us that Talia now leads the tribe. Know that we stand ready to fight, should the shadow fall on Bergama.",""
"55049764-0-7048","Not all who come to train at Leki's Blade learn what they thought they might.",""
"55049764-0-7049","You dirty pig! Whatever you do to me, I will be avenged! You people were fools to even set foot upon Alik'r sands …nnWait … you're not an Imperial, are you?",""
"55049764-0-7050","Whatever it is that you people seek to accomplish, your efforts will be to no avail ….nnWait … you're no Imperial. Are you with King Fahara'jad's army?",""
"55049764-0-7051","Hail, brother. It is good that you have come. nnThe Withered Hand has been hereI can feel it. Stay vigilant.",""
"55049764-0-7052","No time to lose. Send any survivors this way and head to the inner gate!",""
"55049764-0-7053","By the gods, I swear that you infidels will all die. You will find that Redguards are not merciful ….nnHold on … you're no Imperial … does this mean we're going to take the city back?",""
"55049764-0-7054","Be at ease. This is but a simple misunderstanding between merchants who bumped carts. No lives will be lost here.",""
"55049764-0-7055","You collaped the tunnel, the army's re-taken the city, and that son of a dog Khorshad is gone.nnThis ended far better than I hoped.",""
"55049764-0-7056","Thank you for exercising mercy on me.nnI do not believe the Imperials would be so forgiving, so I beseech you … you must slay them all.",""
"55049764-0-7057","This one … cannot speak. My dignity is injured.",""
"55049764-0-7058","The tribe will live and flourish in <<c:1>>. Be proud, you've given our people hope.",""
"55049764-0-7059","I should pray to Y'ffre before the meeting. Is there anything else you need?",""
"55049764-0-7060","Begone, outsider. You have no place here.",""
"55049764-0-7061","Still more tears to close. Very bad. Coldharbour is no good for living.",""
"55049764-0-7062","Once I finish stripping this one, I think I'll go in for a drink.",""
"55049764-0-7063","You're a new face to me, unlike that flappy buzzard over the barn.",""
"55049764-0-7064","I've been found! Oh, but you are neither harpy nor Gold Coast fiend. What a relief!",""
"55049764-0-7066","I have done as you asked, as I knew I must. Now leave me to my grief!nnPlease.",""
"55049764-0-7067","Keep one eye to the skies, friend. The harpies like to swoop down and grab whatever's light enough to carry. I've lost two hats and a goat to the feathered villains.",""
"55049764-0-7068","You're alive! I thought they might have taken you too ….",""
"55049764-0-7069","There you are! Impressive work back there. The Maormer didn't know what hit them when our forces stormed inand I've got my ship back!",""
"55049764-0-7070","You ready to go? I don't know what the Sea Vipers plan, but I doubt we have much time to stop them.",""
"55049764-0-7071","If you wish my company, we should hurry. The Sea Vipers wouldn't commit their forces unless they're certain of success.",""
"55049764-0-7072","There are more Maormer sorcerers over there than I've ever seen, but I've been practicing. We'll find them all if that's what needs doing.nnMy power and yours, together. We can stop them.",""
"55049764-0-7073","Ah, great. The Eagles took over in Pa'alat. Now it's going to be just another boring tavern town under the Queen's thumb.",""
"55049764-0-7074","This Khajiit is glad to hear the Eagles have taken control in Pa'alat. There are too many dark things in the shadows to allow shadows to fester.",""
"55049764-0-7075","Look at this place! We'd better stick together and find a way to get to Molag Grunda and open the Gatehouse.nnI think Molag Grunda is barricaded within another room.",""
"55049764-0-7076","With the might of the Mages Guild on our side, perhaps we can finally push back Montclair's soldiers and take back Shornhelm's northern district!",""
"55049764-0-7077","Caution, friend. Not all in town wish the Dominion well.",""
"55049764-0-7078","As if this place weren't dangerous enough, now we've got foreign troops from Brindle in here. What are you going to do about that?",""
"55049764-0-7079","Good to see some faces from home. I feel safer with Castle Brindle in friendly hands.",""
"55049764-0-7080","With the Covenant in charge of Brindle, maybe I'll propose my idea for a wall around Vlastarus to the local commander.",""
"55049764-0-7081","Welcome to the tribe, sister. The wisdom of the Chief was deep as a well. I know his faith in you was deserved.",""
"55049764-0-7082","The Shadeyou must kill it if we are to end this.",""
"55049764-0-7083","I need to get away from these birds. With Brindle in friendly hands, maybe they need cooks. First meal would be chicken, if I have my way.",""
"55049764-0-7084","You draw the sword for us all, brother. True honor need … need not be named.  Avenge us.",""
"55049764-0-7085","So the Covenant took over Castle Brindle. Is that supposed to make me feel safer? Well, it doesn't.",""
"55049764-0-7086","The Altmer don't seem to think we're capable. Well, we'll show them who can fight!",""
"55049764-0-7087","The Queen and the Silvenar are safe as long as we are on watch.",""
"55049764-0-7088","You bear the tribe's burdens now, sister. Remembertrue honor need not be named. Seek not fame or glory, only justice.",""
"55049764-0-7089","Do not look upon me with pity, brother. Hearts such as ours, crowded with great and terrible purpose, have no room for such things.",""
"55049764-0-7090","Fill this poisoned cup with our enemies' blood, brother. All of the Alik'r watches you. May Tava speed your passage.",""
"55049764-0-7091","Word swirls through camp like a dust devil. So you are Ash'abah now? That is good, brother. nnTrue honor need not be named. Send the Withered Hand back to Oblivion.",""
"55049764-0-7092","Welcome to the tribe, brother. I regret we have nothing to give but our blessings.",""
"55049764-0-7093","Both Zamyad and Parvenah took to the Far Shores during your trial, brother. I fear we will lose even more swords yet.",""
"55049764-0-7094","If I ever find Donus, I'll return to Cheydinhal. I hope Kirandas hasn't given up hope.",""
"55049764-0-7095","True honor need not be named, brother. May your blade never go thirsty while these fiends still draw breath.",""
"55049764-0-7096","Vikord and I have a wager in play. Just to make things more interesting. Whoever collects the most Dremora hearts wins.",""
"55049764-0-7097","Sinfay thinks she can beat a Nord in a contest? Especially a killing contest? Ha! By the time we're through, I'll have more Dremora hearts than I can carry!",""
"55049764-0-7098","Hail, brother. The poison of Morwha's Bounty has run its course, thank Ruptga. It would take ten and ten to keep me from my work. Rumor swirls across the dunes. Some say there is a vampiric curse staining Leki's Blade, and now we have found proof.",""
"55049764-0-7099","True honor need not be named, brother. My son's sickness broke while you took on the crucible. You are indeed blessed by the Divines!",""
"55049764-0-7100","All praise to Ruptga: it appears my brother will recover. I take your arrival as a gift, brother. Divines willing, we shall fight beside you soon.",""
"55049764-0-7101","Well, well … took you long enough. Gran-gran could have cleared that cave out faster than you did. And she's only got one arm!",""
"55049764-0-7102","I think that little Wood Elf was planning to face Molag Grunda all by herself before Cadwell ran up there. You'd better catch up with them. I'll make sure nothing follows you.",""
"55049764-0-7103","Go speak to <<1>>. Perhaps she'll be able to help us.",""
"55049764-0-7104","You will help us find a way to forge these dangerous waters and get our troops past the Reaver Citadel. I have total confidence in you.",""
"55049764-0-7105","This looks pretty grim. We'll never find a way into that citadel. I think we should just cut our losses and head home now.",""
"55049764-0-7106","My brother's nervous. So am I. This quest of ours never seems to end!",""
"55049764-0-7107","There's bound to be a way into that place. I mean, besides the front door. I imagine there are a lot of Dremora waiting on the other side of the gate.",""
"55049764-0-7108","I'm impressed, little mortal. Hardly a scratch on you!",""
"55049764-0-7109","You did it again, my fearless friend! Well done!nnWith the Dremora caught between my powerful mages and King Dynar's relentless fighters, they won't know which way to turn.",""
"55049764-0-7110","Hurry, now. Get to the upper city and activate the Mages Guild portal.nnWithout the help of the mages, this entire endeavor could come crashing down around us.",""
"55049764-0-7111","You're back. Did you tell Brielus? Is he coming for me?",""
"55049764-0-7112","I hear you cleansed the blight. We're mighty grateful.",""
"55049764-0-7113","You've been such a great help! I'm off to see Telenger as soon as I finish this.",""
"55049764-0-7114","I'm exhausted. Find another sparring partner if you're still looking for a fight.",""
"55049764-0-7115","The ritual site is beyond the door. Keep that lodestone close at hand for those ritual horns!",""
"55049764-0-7116","Since both Alasan and Uwafa have been dealt with, the Withered Hand may be considerably weakened.nnPerhaps the third Ansei Ward is closer at hand than you realize. If the gods are with you, I believe you will recover it quickly.",""
"55049764-0-7117","Though the memories of Aranias fade, you areand forever will bea friend to the Valenwood … and a friend to me.",""
"55049764-0-7118","You have no idea how good this feels! To be whole again, and walk with my own two legs. To have legs at all!",""
"55049764-0-7119","You! You're alive! Just what I need!",""
"55049764-0-7120","Any time you're ready.",""
"55049764-0-7121","Thank you again for returning my brother's coin to me. I'll remember him whenever I feel it in my pocket.",""
"55049764-0-7122","I already told youI have no wish to suffer at the Taskmaster's hand!",""
"55049764-0-7123","I'd welcome you to Whisper Grove, but it's little more than a city of ash at the moment.nnPlease, I don't have time to take care of visitors. My husband Fingaenion here has been injured, and I have an army of Daedra to deal with.",""
"55049764-0-7124","Thank you for giving me closure. I hoped Divyth was still alive, but this is better than always wondering and worrying.",""
"55049764-0-7125","Stranger is good to this one, and to others. Now Khajiit has to do her part.",""
"55049764-0-7126","I'm going to have to figure out how to discretely return all of these things …",""
"55049764-0-7127","You know where I stand. We have sliced through the enemies' ranks to get this far, and my blades are still at your disposal. nnI do not relish fighting, but I have trained since birth for this kind of thing.",""
"55049764-0-7128","I always hated my sister. But I'd never wanted her dead.",""
"55049764-0-7129","That pompous mage told me to keep an eye on her, and that's just what I'm doing. But I have the distinct feeling that I amuse her.nnI'm not sure how I feel about that.",""
"55049764-0-7130","I allowed your intrusion because it was obvious this would end in a clash of wills. It proved … enlightening.",""
"55049764-0-7131","I'd really like to be alone. I need to mourn my daughter.",""
"55049764-0-7132","I'm glad you brought the families some closure. Still, I would have liked to end the bastard myself.",""
"55049764-0-7133","You have this one's thanks, stranger. Moons' light be with you by night, always.",""
"55049764-0-7134","<<1>> is glad she could calm her brother down. He did not need to be poisoned by outrage. Your coming has not set all things right, but at least we still have our lives.",""
"55049764-0-7135","Shove something silver and pointy into their furry behinds, traveler. Make sure they know Atrius Axilla sent you!",""
"55049764-0-7136","Thank you, my friend. Prince Azah said you were indispensable. I now see why.nnYou do an old soldier a great favor by helping. I hope Shiri is not hurt, and even moreso, I hope that text has not been taken again by the Withered Hand.",""
"55049764-0-7137","Meet me in front of the cathedral when you are ready to launch the attack. Time is no longer on our side.",""
"55049764-0-7138","This is … unthinkable. Shiri came to me only a few months ago, but she seemed so dedicated. Of course she was! She was studying the Ansei Wards …! How could I not have seen this?nnI hope we find her before she does something … terrible.",""
"55049764-0-7139","Everyone says you've saved the village from committing a terrible mistake. Thank you, it will make my trading much easier.",""
"55049764-0-7140","Hey, thanks for setting us right.",""
"55049764-0-7141","So, you did it. Summoner Division Champion! It's an honor.nnNormally I'd offer my services as your servant, unfortunately Ishalga has reassigned me to other duties.",""
"55049764-0-7142","I understand congratulations are in order. Winning the Sorceror Division Championship is no small matter! Very impressive.",""
"55049764-0-7143","Won the Division Campionship for the Swordmasters, did you? That's damned impressive. I may place some coin on you for the finals.",""
"55049764-0-7144","Velyn Harbor is rumored to be overrun. I wish you luck. We'll be preparing for Malabal Tor ourselves.",""
"55049764-0-7145","You saved Greenshade and my people are safe. I can't thank you enough.",""
"55049764-0-7146","Is it true? What Cariel speaks? Indaenir, resurrected?",""
"55049764-0-7147","I wish you luck in Malabal Tor. I hope to see you at the joining of the Silvenar and the Green Lady.",""
"55049764-0-7148","It seems a ceremony is in order. Indaenir will meet up with the Green Lady and the two will be united in Silvenar. This one hopes to see you there.",""
"55049764-0-7149","Lord Gharesh-ri spoke of the ceremony between the Silvenar and the Green Lady. This one hopes to be there.",""
"55049764-0-7150","This one wonders where our journeys will take us next. Hopefully not back to Elsweyr so soon.",""
"55049764-0-7151","Sounds like the Dominion leaders will be moving to Malabal Tor. I'll remain to ensure the Heritance regrets setting foot on Greenshade.",""
"55049764-0-7152","A shame I missed out on all the fun. You owe me quite the tale now!",""
"55049764-0-7153","Believe me, I'd have been by your side, but … that Cariel. She's a feisty one. The things she threatened me with if I followed!nnI thought the Vinedusks were tough, but the Eyes of the Queen? I'll be happy to stay on their good side.",""
"55049764-0-7154","My guess is Indaenir's next destination will be Malabal Tor. I wonder if he's already met the Green Lady.",""
"55049764-0-7155","Looks like you took care of Naemon. Greenshade is safe now.",""
"55049764-0-7156","I hope our paths cross again under better circumstances.",""
"55049764-0-7157","This one hopes to see you again. Times are rough with Great War and we could use your help securing the Dominion.nnKauzanabi-jo only seeks to protect and educate the Lunar Champions.",""
"55049764-0-7158","You're going to duel Erthas, huh? Gilraen thinks he's been allied with the Daedra since long before Whisper Grove. nnI wonder if he still bleeds like a Bosmer.",""
"55049764-0-7159","So the word is you're going to put an end to Erthas. Good.nnI never liked him, even when he was one of us. Had a haughty air about him. Still, I never expected him to do all this!",""
"55049764-0-7160","Our powerthe power of the Ansei Wardswas compromised, and the Alik'r desert was in grave danger … but you stepped in.nnYou stopped the necromancers and the Alik'r desert is again safe from the risen dead.",""
"55049764-0-7161","You aided me at <<Ac:1>>. I'd be a fool not to return the favor. Whatever the Sea Vipers plan, we should hurry.",""
"55049764-0-7162","Now that the Imperials are gone, we can pick up the pieces. If the Divines will it, the Imperials will not come here under any other ill tiding.",""
"55049764-0-7163","Know, O wayfarer, how much we have lost. They may be gone but we may never recover.",""
"55049764-0-7164","I hope you slew every one of the Imperials you came across, wayfarer. It would only be fair if such woe would befall them as has us.",""
"55049764-0-7165","We're getting reports in from all over the desert. Withered Hand's crumbling fast.nnWe did it, my friend. We did it.",""
"55049764-0-7166","It has reached me that you had a hand in our liberation, wayfarer. Long may you prosper.",""
"55049764-0-7168","We have a new master nowhave you not heard? Such a sudden change.",""
"55049764-0-7169","I sense ill-doings in the cemetery, wayfarer. Our masters speak in hushed tones and Fadalia goes missing. I've no patience for such secrecy.",""
"55049764-0-7170","Do not tell anyone, but a sword-brother of mine has heard talk of vampires lurking in Leki's Blade.  Vampires! How could such creatures survive in so holy a place? It must be idle gossip.",""
"55049764-0-7171","The Cemetary is off limits to students now, but our groundskeepers remain outside. Odd.",""
"55049764-0-7172","The newly blessed swordsmen are just as quiet as the last. What secrets they tell at the graduation ceremony must be solemn indeed.",""
"55049764-0-7173","Since you won the challenge, I'm bound by our code to let you go. nnHowever, the other Ungodly might not be so scrupulous. I hope not, anyway.",""
"55049764-0-7174","Have you visited the graves of the Masters? We have been told to stay away, but It seems somehow easier to breath there now. I always gave it a wide berth before. The solemnity was … oppressive.",""
"55049764-0-7175","My soul lightens - a door has been opened, wayfarer.  I know not why, but Leki's Blade feels somehow holier since you arrived.",""
"55049764-0-7176","A new Master … ha. It is about time. Let us hope that they are marginally more competent than Fadalia was.",""
"55049764-0-7177","I'm joyful this has all ended, though I may never rest easily again. Beware of shifting sands, wayfarer.",""
"55049764-0-7178","Hark, wayfarer. Do you suppose the Imperials brought all of these boxes and barrels with them, through the tunnel you destroyed? I'm sure we didn't have this many.",""
"55049764-0-7179","DiscipleI mean, Master Raifais at least as skillful as Fadalia was. The school is in good hands.",""
"55049764-0-7180","Abide with me, wayfarer. Tu'whacca's breath, you've won us time for that, at least!",""
"55049764-0-7181","My relief knows no bounds, wayfarer… but the damage they accomplished will be no mean feat to recover from. Zeht's tears, I may be fetching our things for ages!",""
"55049764-0-7182","I won't feign otherwise, wayfarer - it surprises me little that the coward Khorshad brought us to this. By my father's head, he never seemed entirely trustworthy to me.",""
"55049764-0-7183","I rejoice for we who yet live, wayfarer. My legs will never tire, now that we are rid of that menace!",""
"55049764-0-7184","By Tava's red feathers! Did you hear the rumor, wayfarer? Master Fadalia is a vampire! I will sleep with my twice-blessed silver blades close from now on.",""
"55049764-0-7185","The Imperials are like unto sand, wayfarer. As the wind brings them in, it avails us by carrying them away, just the same.",""
"55049764-0-7186","By Tava's red feathers! Did you hear the rumor, wayfarer? Master Fadalia is a vampire! I will sleep with my twice-blessed silver blades close from now on.",""
"55049764-0-7187","I was in the middle of my prayers when they forced me out of the cemetery. By Ruptga's starry breeches, what could be so important? Please don't tell them I was spying.",""
"55049764-0-7188","Though I know you'll presently be gone, wayfarer, Satakalaam welcomes you to abide as long as you need. Peace be upon you in all your dealings.",""
"55049764-0-7189","Zeht's tears, what are they doing in there? Master Fadalia's face was taut with concern. Did someone deface Ahtar's grave?",""
"55049764-0-7190","I had only just arrived to pray when Master Fadalia and the rest sent me away. I mean no disrespect to our teachers, but they might give us some warning next time.",""
"55049764-0-7192","Let's get inside and see what's waiting for us.",""
"55049764-0-7193","The school has gone quiet. Has something happened? I saw a small gathering outside the graves - some faces were flushed, others were pale.",""
"55049764-0-7194","We're as ready as we shall ever be.",""
"55049764-0-7195","I have never seen Nabeenam so silent. He has always been stoic, but this is different. It is something about Master Ahtar. Do you suppose someone might have defaced his grave?",""
"55049764-0-7196","I feel a fog has lifted since you arrived, wayfarer. That hidden dread flees and Master Fadalia goes missing. This no coincidence. We must remain vigilant.",""
"55049764-0-7197","By my father's head! The unworthy Imperials have made such a fine mess of things here.",""
"55049764-0-7198","Please, get rid of that creature. But be careful. Her magic is formidable!",""
"55049764-0-7199","So, many interesting sights to see, don't you think?",""
"55049764-0-7200","This one suggests you keep your eyes on your coin purse. The wood elves aren't to be trusted.",""
"55049764-0-7201","Shasirba makes such wonderful baked goods. You should try some yourself! Or, some supplies for the road from me?",""
"55049764-0-7202","Khuzi hopes you found that necklace well enough. She'd hate for someone so strong to be distraught.",""
"55049764-0-7203","I'm looking for a present for my sister but there are too many options.",""
"55049764-0-7204","I heard the Queen is in Rawl'kha. I hope I get to see her.",""
"55049764-0-7205","This one is very busy. Maybe another time.",""
"55049764-0-7206","Can you move please? You're blocking my view.",""
"55049764-0-7207","My brother did the right thing. That Altmer was a pompous ass.",""
"55049764-0-7208","We've been together in this battle since the beginning. You know I'll do whatever it takes to destroy the Withered Hand.nnThat said, Shiri's already proven more than a match for me. We have to win this one, and you know best how to do that.",""
"55049764-0-7209","I slave away in this hot kitchen but Duzal still buys meat pies from Shasirba. I need to learn her secret.",""
"55049764-0-7210","Seems we do more drinking than fighting sometimes, eh comrade?",""
"55049764-0-7211","I will join you, if you wish. nnI am no great warrior. I am only a humble priest, but Tu'whacca says I can be of great assistance to you in this battle. He says it is up to you to make this decision though.",""
"55049764-0-7212","Hush now, you'll frighten them. They don't know what awaits us! No one knows … no one knows ….",""
"55049764-0-7213","Seems like just moments ago we were in Dune, yes? It is a good thing Raz is so quick on his feet. Wouldn't want you waiting on him … like we are waiting on the Guildmaster.",""
"55049764-0-7214","I don't know how you managed to pull this off, but the guilds are with you!",""
"55049764-0-7215","I heard <<1>>. Let's fight!",""
"55049764-0-7216","What do you want?","Che cosa vuoi?"
"55049764-0-7217","Your skull needs more dents. I can help you with that.",""
"55049764-0-7218","What are you looking at?",""
"55049764-0-7219","The Dremora are fully engaged. If you're going to get the Mages Guild portal working, the time to leave is now.",""
"55049764-0-7220","Once the mages get inside the upper city, the Dremora will be surrounded!",""
"55049764-0-7221","There may be some useful information in these old books, and this map is a remarkable discovery.",""
"55049764-0-7222","Greetings.","Saluti."
"55049764-0-7223","Now that my apprentice is back, we can finally get out of here!",""
"55049764-0-7224","This is a day I'll long remember! After months of searching I've finally discovered the location of my ancestral estate. It's not far from here! nnAs soon as I pack my things, I'm off to claim my rightful inheritance as the Heir of Direfrost Keep!",""
"55049764-0-7225","Not to worry, I'll be right behind you! We'll give that Valkynaz the thrashing he so richly deserves!",""
"55049764-0-7226","Hello, um, Maruin wishes to see you. He says you're late for your story.",""
"55049764-0-7227","I pray you can help me, good traveler. They have her, and I'm desperate!",""
"55049764-0-7228","Your choices were difficult, but you have made them well.",""
"55049764-0-7229","I can finally close my eyes.",""
"55049764-0-7230","Thank you again. The preparations for the wedding have been made, and so far, we have only been hit with tomatoes, and not rocks.",""
"55049764-0-7231","Good show! The portal belongs to us now! nnSir Darien and that lovely lizard have gone on ahead. I think he might be a bit intimidated by our prowess on the field of battle, and he's trying to compensate.",""
"55049764-0-7232","You've reminded me of my purpose. I'm sorry I ever forgot it. I hope Laurosse will forgive me.",""
"55049764-0-7233","What we did. Murdering an entire family. Is this what Y'ffre demands?",""
"55049764-0-7234","I'm glad they're dead. I don't care who hears me. Halalin … Halalin won't stop screaming in my head.",""
"55049764-0-7235","At last it is over. At last, I can grieve.",""
"55049764-0-7236","This one sees and knows what you have done here, walker. Your five-clawed assault will be remembered.",""
"55049764-0-7237","Fool that you are, this one is glad for you to have been here. A spotless choice, walker. We still have our temple and our city to keep, yes?",""
"55049764-0-7238","I have heard it said someone opened holes to Oblivion in the middle of Dune, and that a five-clawed walker had just the thing to plug up these holes. I wonder who could have done such a thing?",""
"55049764-0-7239","Great! I'm sure the Vinedusks there will appreciate the help, especially with the Mane hanging around.nnBodring is in charge there. Find him and let him know I sent you. That way he'll know I haven't forgotten him.",""
"55049764-0-7240","Dune will be sleek again, in time. Especially sleek if five-clawed walkers like yourself fill its streets, this one is thinking.",""
"55049764-0-7241","No army has come, and yet Dune stands free of daedra. Shimsamu has heard a strange walker, sleek and five-clawed, is to thank for this. Do you think this walker might be available? Or… if this walker had any siblings, that would be fine too.",""
"55049764-0-7242","The Sea Vipers are insane! They're trying to create another hurricane!",""
"55049764-0-7243","Magundim watched you fight, when he could. To have learned it all is impossible to expect, but I think I learned enough to be able to help my city. Perhaps a future with the guard is in store for Magundim, yes?",""
"55049764-0-7245","Dular wonders, walker, if you recall whether certain buildings were intact during your foray into Dune's merchant district. It is best if they all are, of course, but for this reason and that reason, it is better for me ifNo, I go too far.",""
"55049764-0-7246","Those bastards killed Patraud, for little more than stepping into the clearing. These Bosmer are savages.",""
"55049764-0-7247","The danger is gone, yes? Can you tell me, walker? If it is safe to walk into the city once more, Yanu-ma has many bellies to fill, she thinks. Perhaps you would like some of what Yanu-ma has to offer, hmm?",""
"55049764-0-7248","This one hears the claws that came to unravel Dune's knot bore an uncanny resemblance to the one standing here, now, speaking to him. If that is so, this one thanks you,  but reminds you, not everything can be free after a disaster.",""
"55049764-0-7249","I'm flattered by the attention, but I think it's time you were on your way.",""
"55049764-0-7250","Anyone capable of what you've accomplished here should consider membership in the Guild. We could use someone like you.nnEspecially since you've proven yourself capable of tackling daedra and dark anchors.",""
"55049764-0-7251","Closing a portal system of that magnitude is no mean feat, even with our assistance. You should consider joining the Guild - we could use someone like you.",""
"55049764-0-7252","Isn't it amazing? The crisis has ended, but our little town will continue. I'm so pleased!",""
"55049764-0-7253","I think I'll keep the tavern open. This safe haven needs to be preserved.",""
"55049764-0-7254","I've decided to stick around. Help turn the Hollow City back into a proper city. Who cares if it just happens to be in the middle of Coldharbour? That just adds a bit of character to the place.",""
"55049764-0-7255","Well, I guess I'm stuck here. Someone has to help feed all these people.nnJust my luck, the Hollow City has become a destination spot.",""
"55049764-0-7256","This guild hall is certainly more impressive than many of the posts I've been assigned to. And it feels good to have fighters running around its corridors.",""
"55049764-0-7257","Even far from everything we know, some things remain the same. Potential mages guild candidates, carrying a strange tome or two, picked up on your travels. Care to show me what you have found?",""
"55049764-0-7258","Thank you for your intercession, wayfarer. Between the harpies and the Gold Coasterswell, I might have had to sell this place.",""
"55049764-0-7259","Thank you for muzzling those mercenaries, wayfarer. As with all dogs, a thump on the snout is sometimes required.",""
"55049764-0-7260","I would've liked a few harpy heads mounted on the tavern wall, but at least I can let my horses graze without me guarding them.",""
"55049764-0-7261","By Tava's red feathers, it is well to have a moment's peace unmarred by harpy screeching. I do not know how you did it, wayfarer, but you have my thanks.",""
"55049764-0-7262","Long and long have we suffered under those sellswords, O wayfarer. Would that you had killed them all. Only then would we be truly safe.",""
"55049764-0-7263","Mulama is ruined! The harpies leave and now the dungy Redguard buy no bows! nnYou will buy something to ease this one's sorrow, yes?",""
"55049764-0-7264","No more sound of fighting comes from our Dune. The sight that this one sees is that of our Dune's guards and soldiers and people moving about. She is thinking perhaps the walkers of Dune thirst for Moon-Draughts' moon draughts.",""
"55049764-0-7265","Ah, the five-clawed walker! Four-Toes is thinking of writing tonight. Could you tell him if you said anything witty, perhaps, while fighting the invaders of Dune? This is important, it is for posterity.nAs always, I am ready to trade, as well.",""
"55049764-0-7266","Well, well, if it isn't the hero of the Pact. Glad you made it.",""
"55049764-0-7267","Hi, can I help you?",""
"55049764-0-7268","It's good to hear that the harpies have settled, but my blood still boils at the sight of those mercenaries. They'll not have any of my steel as long as I draw breath. nnYou, however, are invited to look over my goods.",""
"55049764-0-7269","It is as this one thought! None could stand up to his flashing blades, no. None tried, but the result would be the same!",""
"55049764-0-7270","At last, those harpies are gone! I can't wait to start working on some new outerwear. nnYou look eager to begin as well. Can I interest you in any of my goods?",""
"55049764-0-7271","The harpies are gone, but for how long?",""
"55049764-0-7272","Tu'whacca bless you, O wayfarer. At last I can sleep without fear of the sound of wings.",""
"55049764-0-7273","At last, the village returns to normal. Now we can attend to the vital business of removing Andrin from office.",""
"55049764-0-7274","I had hoped you would burn the harpies out, but I suppose bringing those mercenaries to heel is some comfort.",""
"55049764-0-7275","The harpies may be gone, but their tangled nests and foul droppings remain. We have much work left to do.",""
"55049764-0-7276","Zur has found you! This one is so happy now.",""
"55049764-0-7277","Peace with the harpies? May as well make peace with the scorpions and fire beetles as well. nnBetter a thousand deaths than to share water with those winged horrors.",""
"55049764-0-7278","I'm grateful for what you've done, O wayfarer. My inn is still in shambles, but at least we can rebuild without fear of further disaster.",""
"55049764-0-7279","Blood and glory, friend. I would have liked to thump some of those harpies with you, but duty calls.",""
"55049764-0-7280","Brave meeting, friend. Good job accounting for those good-for-nothing sellswords. I heard them howling through a stone wall.",""
"55049764-0-7281","Welcome to the Kozanset Fighters Guildhall, traveler. nnYou look capableeven dangerous. Have you considered joining the guild?",""

"55049764-0-7284","It was good of you to protect the town as you did. nnI still wish we'd used our powers to help, by Y'ffre.",""
"55049764-0-7285","Greetings, seeker, and welcome to the Kozanset Mages Guild Hall. I trust you made it here unmolested? The Redguards are not overfond of our presence here.nnI am curious: what do you have there?",""
"55049764-0-7286","You again? I knew you were up to no good! Get away from me before I call the guards!",""
"55049764-0-7287","Are you still here? Perhaps you should pull up a rock and help us with our work. Do something useful while you're here.",""
"55049764-0-7288","This one wonders, why are you still here? Don't you have a great mage to rescue or something?",""
"55049764-0-7289","You're going to leave me all alone again, aren't you Alexis?nnWell, I forgive you anyway and I'll be right here when you return.",""
"55049764-0-7290","Aldolin cannot be far. If you find him before we do, be wary. He will not yield to you and must be put down like the cur that he is.",""
"55049764-0-7291","About time you got here.",""
"55049764-0-7292","You'll want to talk to Copper, not me. My word has a hefty price.",""
"55049764-0-7293","Excellent. Manthir often peddles his wares here, but right now he is likely at his home just across the market to the east. Look for him there to start.nnAnd don't worry, Manthir is a soft one.",""
"55049764-0-7294","If you want to talk to her, I won't stop you. She lives in the next house over.",""
"55049764-0-7295","Please inform my colleagues that I'll be with them shortly. I wish to finish speaking to the one who calls himself the Groundskeeper.",""
"55049764-0-7296","I can't wait to get back into uniform. Undercover work isn't my cup of tea.",""
"55049764-0-7298","You are the one who killed my brother Uwafa, are you not?nnI will grant that you are likely a formidable foe, but once I become a lich, I will burn you to cinders. There's nothing you can do to stop me now.",""
"55049764-0-7299","Thank you. We were on our way to Longhaven when the Argonians struck. Free my companions and meet us there. I'll repay you however I can.",""
"55049764-0-7300","Come see me when you are done with the siege weapons, warrior.",""
"55049764-0-7301","You have done well, traveler. Stand beside Shazah, struggling against the darkness. You have taken your first steps down a difficult path.",""
"55049764-0-7302","All clear? Good. I'll be stationed here indefinitely, for the security of the Dominion, but it's good to know things are safe for now.nnI wonder if I could get that Khajiit girl to bring me a snack every once in a while.",""
"55049764-0-7303","All this skulking around, using up valuable energy on apprentice-level illusions. I grow ever more weary. Even Zur's enthusiasm is ebbing.",""
"55049764-0-7304","Y'ffre's bones, I've been seeing flocks of cats scurrying about Dune since the fighting stopped!nnDo cats flock? Or is it a ""pride"" thing? Could you ask one of the khajiit that?nnAnd if you do, come back and show me the scars.",""
"55049764-0-7305","Don't waste time searching for me after you leave. You'll have larger concerns soon enough.",""
"55049764-0-7306","A Daedra attack! My, my, my. A nasty business that. At least they left my gems intact … mostly.nnGet you something?",""
"55049764-0-7307","Steer clear of us Armigers. I don't think your reputation could take it, hero.",""
"55049764-0-7308","Don't mind Craw, she likes messing with people. You seem like you could use a bow. Do you want to go hunting some time?",""
"55049764-0-7309","You again. I always seem to run into you right before I do something I'll probably regret.",""
"55049764-0-7310","It will take time to accept what you have said.nnI… This body is so heavy.",""
"55049764-0-7311","Nidras, a thief? And to think I trusted him with our valuables! How embarrassing.",""
"55049764-0-7312","It must be done and I would be most grateful.nnYou should know that who or whatever wrote this book bound it to the labyrinth. To traverse one, you need the other.",""
"55049764-0-7313","Ah, you're back. You have the meat pies, yes?",""
"55049764-0-7314","Azdanten has heard of a skooma distillery, that it has been destroyed, that it was in a cave under an old blind walker's well.nnOf course, you know Azdanten has had nothing to do with that nonsense. This one is an honest trader, as you well know.",""
"55049764-0-7315","Excuse this one, walker, but her curiosity overcomes her, and she must know! This one hears stories of ghosts, and that they have been exorcised from a local home.nnWhat is to be made of it?",""
"55049764-0-7316","I've been hearing stories of bandits in the area!nnOur caravan has only two guards for the moment, do you suppose they will be enough?nnSome of the khajiit have been saying the bandits have been dealt with, though. I guess it might not be a problem.",""
"55049764-0-7317","I overheard something a bit absurd from some of the locals.nnThis town had a local crime lord? The thought is honestly a bit ridiculous.nnI can relax a bit, I guess. That's always good news.",""
"55049764-0-7318","Been hearing interesting things, about someone meeting your description dealing with a local ring of bandits, smugglers, drug runners and the like.nnNice work.",""
"55049764-0-7319","Now I have to wait for him to summon up the courage to approach me. I wonder how long I'll be waiting this time?",""
"55049764-0-7320","Ever lasting darkness awaits. Nothing bad could happen.nnOr Zur is a horrible liar and this is not good at all.",""
"55049764-0-7321","Wait till I tell Mother the news. The rest of her hair will fall out!",""
"55049764-0-7322","The Sea Hawk is just there, on the southern dock. Remember, the silks are likely below deck. And while I know Angore is not aboard, I can't guarantee that his goons won't try to stop you. You look like you can handle yourself though.",""
"55049764-0-7323","Good work! Hostages came out and we attacked. Cut right through the bastards and scoured the city. Just a handful of Imperials holding out now.nnI still haven't figured out how they got here though … I'm worried reinforcements may be on the way.",""
"55049764-0-7324","You must hurry. Sooner or later, the Lord of Schemes will become aware that we're closer to our goal than his army realizes.nnI'll keep this portal open for as long as I can. That should allow us to bring in a few reinforcements of our own.",""
"55049764-0-7325","I would not enter the mine now for love or gold. There's not enough of either to convince me.",""
"55049764-0-7326","Please, come, browse my wares! I have many fine drinks and brews. Available to one and all!",""
"55049764-0-7327","Have a look! Take all the time you need. And spare me your wary glances! Colovians like myself have a rich history of trade. Really, we do.",""
"55049764-0-7328","You have performed better than I expected, even in the face of unrelenting danger and the worst horrors Oblivion has to offer.nnI am impressed.",""
"55049764-0-7329","Speak to your friends, for these moments may be their last. nnBut do not tarry too long. Time is fleeting, and each moment is a thief that steals far more than it brings.",""
"55049764-0-7330","What are you doing here? Why aren't you saving my daughter?",""
"55049764-0-7331","Thank you. May the Green keep you safe in your travels.",""

"55049764-0-7336","Split-Tongue hears Rakhad no longer hides under the rocks of S'ren-ja.nnThis is good news for Split-Tongue, for his tongue was split by Rakhad's minions. It is a small kind of revenge for him, yes?",""
"55049764-0-7337","There are unscrupulous shopkeepers in Woodhearth, but Adaishir is not one of them.",""
"55049764-0-7338","Silly Bosmer. We pluck the wealth from the Valenwood and sell it back to them, and they pay us joyfully.",""
"55049764-0-7339","This one hears all sorts of good news this day!nnAbout this thing and that thing, this friend has a pregnant mate, that friend met someone new in Rawl'kha, and best of all - that stink of skooma is all gone from this one's town!nnA good day, yes?",""
"55049764-0-7340","So I found out while those skooma slingers were running out of town that, when they lick their teeth, it's one of those little signs of skooma use.nnI had no idea.nnShould I just not say anything, or should I tell someone it's okay to want to eat me?",""
"55049764-0-7341","Bury an axe in that Daedric bastard!",""
"55049764-0-7342","This one hopes the Claw will remain safe now, walker.nnWhat an end to a pilgrimage, yes? Stillthe Claw is safe. This is what matters, this one thinks.",""
"55049764-0-7343","Molag Bal has much to answer for. Remember those who gave their lives today.",""
"55049764-0-7344","I wish I could go with you. I've always wanted to cut down some Daedra on Molag Bal's home turf. But I have confidence you'll get the job done. Good luck.",""
"55049764-0-7345","This one hopes your hands ran red with the blood of the Stonefire.nnEither way, you have done the Order of the Claw such a service.",""

"55049764-0-7349","Wealth beyond measure, muthsera. Someday … perhaps, someday, I will be ready to meet you in combat. But I have seen that this is not a fate yet for which I am prepared.nnYou are like a saint of strife in the arena, muthsera.",""
"55049764-0-7350","Well, plough me sideways. The dung-breathed child won a fight or two.nnPat yourself on the back, my hands are busy and you're not worth the sweat of my pits.",""
"55049764-0-7351","Hey, it's my victorious friend! We are friends, right? Damned fine fight!nnThey're letting me change divisions! Did you talk to anyone? What did you say about me? You didn't call me a coward, did you? Hah, of course not.",""
"55049764-0-7352","Nonsense. Clearly you're sleeping with the judges. Or you've poisoned the water supply or laced your weapons with filthor some other trick.nnYou're no better than me. You can't be any better than me. It just wouldn't be fair or right.",""
"55049764-0-7353","Keep your head. Clearly I'd lose my arms trying to take it, heh.nnI'd rather keep my arms and rejoin the One than lose them to you. It's a hard thing, to lick a stump so close to your face.",""
"55049764-0-7354","Oh, hello. I think we've met, haven't we?nnDid you just win something? Are you a fighter? That's very interesting.nnI think I've earned enough to make my way back to Wayrest. There's something important waiting for me there, but I can't recall what.",""
"55049764-0-7355","Why do you bother Mazou-dar? You have your earnings.nnYou already know you cannot bet, walker. Be happy with your money and go.nnWhy talk to Mazou-dar? He has nothing for you.",""
"55049764-0-7356","Well fought, sera. Well fought, indeed.nnDid I bet on you? I'll never say, but ask yourselfdo I seem upset? Go on. You've more fights in you, I think.",""
"55049764-0-7357","The spirits spoke of you. Thank you for helping our village. We will provide what support we can to your cause.",""
"55049764-0-7358","I saw bright lights up by the tower. There was something spectactular going on up there. nnNo one believes me… but I think it was a battle!",""
"55049764-0-7359","I saw you training a new kind of guardian. Magnificent!",""
"55049764-0-7360","Ah, you ran off without your reward. Here.",""
"55049764-0-7361","The Dominion demands armor, and I provide it. Strongest in Valenwood.",""
"55049764-0-7362","Spare nothing. Waste nothing. The flesh, the hide, the bone: the Green provides.",""
"55049764-0-7363","Say what you will about the Thalmor, they know fine cloth when they see it.",""

"55049764-0-7367","The new management sounds harsh. Why don't you ease the transition a bit for me? It won't take much, just a few coins.",""
"55049764-0-7368","It seems the merchant with whom I am meeting has been slain, sera. Such a pity. This … dungheap … has been an excellent source of workers for House Telvanni.nnSoon, my partner and I will be recalling to Tel Branora to find other such places.",""

"55049764-0-7370","One thing will never change about Leki's Blade, no matter who the master is. We will still need to read stacks of books every day.",""
"55049764-0-7371","Own no weakness or fault, sera. The caravan's master is dead.nnI couldn't be happier. These n'wah slave-merchants always keep such dire, filthy markets. House Telvanni may often be within the ash, but these conditions? Unacceptable to us, always.",""
"55049764-0-7372","By Mauloch! It seems like this dungheap is starting to empty out. Fine by me, these toothless runts were starting to get under my skin.nnWant one for the road?",""
"55049764-0-7373","It is a relief to hear that the Caravan is under new management, yes? In celebration, why not buy something?",""
"55049764-0-7374","Oh, five-clawed khajiit, you are sleek indeed. When next you and this one are in Dune, if you wish for a fine meal and fine company, she will be your host.nnCount on that, five-clawed walker. This one had no expectations of you, and you impressed.",""
"55049764-0-7375","Are you the one they sent to aid our cause? Go right on through. This passage will take you to the sanctuary. Major Cirenwe is waiting with further orders. We'll hold this side of the passage to ensure no trouble comes from behind.",""
"55049764-0-7376","I admit I was worried about my cousin, but you have settled the question as to her fate. I'll miss <<1>>, but at least I know what happened to her.",""
"55049764-0-7377","Wolf hide, deer stomach, rucksacks for every occasion.",""
"55049764-0-7378","Make a decision, will you? Mannimarco could return at any moment!",""
"55049764-0-7379","So Sendel saw your worth. She has always been wise. It is good to have you on our side in this.",""

"55049764-0-7387","I'm very glad I was able to find you. Otherwise, my search has yielded nothing. nnFrom here, I will journey to the city of Kozanset. Perhaps there are signs of the Withered Hand there.",""

"55049764-0-7390","Well, this has my knickers in a twist! We have a perfectly fine army, but what good is it? Sitting around this side of the Chasm, twiddling its collective thumbs.nnIt's rather embarrassing, if truth be told.",""
"55049764-0-7391","Yes, yes, I am far from home. I tired of the smoke and ash of Morrowind and yearned for something new. Now, are you wanting to trade or not?",""
"55049764-0-7392","Welcome back, warrior. If you have questions about Transitus Shrines, ask.",""
"55049764-0-7393","I'm glad that the Imperial has found someone else to talk to. His haughtiness is suffocating.",""
"55049764-0-7394","Oh, thank Y'ffre. I wasn't sure I would find anyone out here. My village needs help. The forest has turned against us!",""
"55049764-0-7395","Astanya can pass word to Her Majesty. Perhaps you can catch a ride on the Prowler. Raz heard Jimila plans to set sail. He suspects she may owe you a favor.",""
"55049764-0-7396","<<1>> is dead, and <<2>> must soon follow. Their fates are tied, you know. For what is a body without the spirit?",""
"55049764-0-7397","Whoever lived here before had a splendid eye for decor. This will suit me just fine.nnWe spend so much time worrying about what happens after life when we should be embracing death and the powers that come with it.",""
"55049764-0-7398","The choice of decor was not my own, if that's what you're wondering.nnIt would appear that this city had its own worshippers of death. I guess even Meridia did not know everything that went on under her very nose.",""
"55049764-0-7399","The colors in here are so drab. Why did the Groundskeeper send me here? My station requires better accommodations than this!nnI can't wait until I'm back home in the Altmer lands. I need to see beautiful colors again.",""
"55049764-0-7400","Rabiza always has the best prices.",""
"55049764-0-7401","The time of battle is fast approaching.nnI should have never let myself get comfortable again. Sometimes it's easy to forget that outside these walls, death waits for all of us.",""
"55049764-0-7402","Please, a coin for my family? We lost everything in the storm, surely you can spare a coin!",""
"55049764-0-7403","Even though it was a trap, I wish I had had more time to explore the library. Imagine the treasures and knowledge I could have acquired!nnAt least Kireth managed to grab a couple of books before we left. I can't wait to start reading them!",""
"55049764-0-7404","It's good to have Raynor back here with me. I … I don't know what I'd do without him.nnJust to see him examining maps and thinking up his next device. It makes me really appreciate how far we've come.",""
"55049764-0-7405","Oh, when I find that Stibbons, he … he will hear an earful from me!nnHow dare he think he can just vanish and leave me all alone? I'll … he'll … he'll be punished severely for this. Quite severely.",""
"55049764-0-7406","For all the years I've spent researching and looking into just how the planes of Oblivion work, I still find my self astonished at every new discovery.nnThat library for instanceI've never experienced a spell quite like that before.",""
"55049764-0-7407","I hear you've been busy, my friend. Good. Very good. nnIs that letter for me?",""
"55049764-0-7408","The treethane is just inside. He'll be glad to see you.",""
"55049764-0-7409","We're holding them back, but I took a few hits. Just give me a few minutes to catch my breath.",""
"55049764-0-7410","I can't tell you how glad I am you're here. Something is horribly amiss, and we can't leave this cave without fearing for our lives until it's put right.",""
"55049764-0-7411","I'm sorry for what I did. Isn't it possible to look the other way? Isn't it possible to forgive?",""
"55049764-0-7412","So Treethane Rolon wants you to investigate the violation of the Green Pact. I don't see what there is to investigate. The culprit is plain enough, but I'm happy to help.",""
"55049764-0-7413","Advocate, please take the convicted to the judgment chamber. The Green will decide the fate of the guilty.",""
"55049764-0-7414","It's amazing how similar everything is despite all this time. I suppose there's only so much you can do with hide, bone, and stone.",""
"55049764-0-7415","You have done what we could notyou have restored us to the Green Pact. All is right, even if all is not yet well. Thank you.",""
"55049764-0-7416","Speak with me when you are done with the siege weapons, warrior.",""
"55049764-0-7417","I've been apprised of some concerning news regarding the Maormer operations off the coast.nnWe appreciate your efforts, of course. We must also remain focused on the tasks at hand.",""

"55049764-0-7420","Hello, adept. Having a fair day, I hope.",""
"55049764-0-7421","Welcome back, comrade! What's the news?",""
"55049764-0-7422","What is it now?",""
"55049764-0-7423","I'm positively chuffed things have gone so well! To be completely honest, I didn't think we had a ghost of a chance. But then, if we weren't up against overwhelming odds, we wouldn't be heroes, would we?",""
"55049764-0-7424","Aha! I caught you red-handed, Artisan! Thieves just can't help returning to the scene of the crime.",""
"55049764-0-7425","With my heraldic cane back I can show myself in court again. You have my deepest thanks.",""
"55049764-0-7426","Castaril is sleeping peacefully now that you've returned Pluck's pelt. He uses it as a blanket, you know.",""
"55049764-0-7427","Thank you for finding my drinking horn. Cassirion and I drank from it at our wedding. He has forgotten, but I drink to remember.",""
"55049764-0-7428","Everything is here. Wonderful. Allow me a moment to apply our elixir ….",""
"55049764-0-7429","Come to stare at a dying Nord, eh? Hate to disappoint you. None of it's fatal.",""

"55049764-0-7432","Are you collecting junk for Adamir's little monsters? Good, good.nnI make little monsters too. See this? It's a ant-fly-worm beast. I mashed them together and added a pinch of Adamir's life juice. It's an adorably gross little guy, isn't it?",""
"55049764-0-7433","You again? Sorry, I have all the ash I need. Good day!",""

"55049764-0-7438","Sounds like we won't need these barricades much longer.",""
"55049764-0-7439","Heard you ran into trouble in <<c:1>>. Sounds like you cleaned up whatever mess the Argonians left.",""
"55049764-0-7440","I haven't seen tracking like that since Haras was leader of the Hounds.",""
"55049764-0-7441","Legend in the Hounds is that there was a Wood Elf named Haras who was the best tracker that ever was. I think you might be in competition for the title now.",""
"55049764-0-7442","You don't understand. He's insane! He'll keep trying to control the undead until he succeeds.",""
"55049764-0-7443","Why did you let <<1>> talk you into this? Do you know how much trouble he's brought to <<Ac:2>>?nnMy apologies, his very presence wears at my manners. What do you need?",""
"55049764-0-7444","The captain wants all these supplies catalogued and stowed before we contact the Thalmor. I should really handle this until <<1>> recovers.",""
"55049764-0-7445","If you think you can help us, talk to Treethane Rolon. He is our leader and handles all matters of justice.",""
"55049764-0-7446","Thank you for returning my censer, but I don't know if I want it anymore. There's too many sad memories associated with it now.",""
"55049764-0-7447","Listen, we don't need any more trouble than we already have. But if you want to help, talk to Treethane Rolon.",""
"55049764-0-7448","There's some trouble up ahead. I thought I would let you know.",""
"55049764-0-7449","I once heard Ledronor talking about a great tracker named Haras, from a long time ago. If I didn't know better, I'd think you were him.",""
"55049764-0-7450","This is Brackenleaf's forest you're entering. Pick no fights and respect the shrines and you're welcome to stay as long as you like.nnOtherwise, you'll learn quick enough why they call us Brackenleaf's Briars.",""
"55049764-0-7451","You have the blessinggood.nnThen with open arms, I welcome you to our family, Brackenleaf's Briars. May you succeed in all your hunts and the great tree keep you in the shade of his leafy branches.",""
"55049764-0-7452","What was it like to fight Master Pellingare's children? Don't tell my boss, but I never liked them.",""
"55049764-0-7453","You're the one who defeated that army down here before, right? We're looking for someone, and could really use your expertise.",""
"55049764-0-7454","You! You're the one who killed my children! You whoreson dog! How dare you show your face here againI. nnHaven't you done enough to my family?",""
"55049764-0-7455","Feel free to return. Soon, I'll have this place looking as grand as it ever did.nnAll will be welcome. The locals … perhaps even witches, if they'll look to reform. Drodda claimed that witches are not evil. We'll see.",""
"55049764-0-7456","Brackenleaf is pleased, but you are not finished yet. Each hunter is also prey to another hunter. Wolf hunts tiger and tiger hunts snake and snake hunts wolf.nnIt's not enough to hunt your prey. You must also prove stronger than those who hunt you.",""
"55049764-0-7457","Your trial is not complete until you enter my trunk and reach my heart. Are you ready to enter?",""
"55049764-0-7458","We have no quarrel with you, living one. Indeed, we thank you for your part in awakening us. The invaders in the Barrowbough must be stopped!",""
"55049764-0-7459","Survived then, have you? Jolly good, jolly good.",""
"55049764-0-7460","I may not like her, but your Dremora friend has certainly been good to her word. She used her own blood to open the door for us. I've never seen anything like it.nnWell, off with you! And remember, we'll be right behind you.",""
"55049764-0-7461","The darkness is obviously designed to hinder our progress. What an interesting conundrum.",""
"55049764-0-7462","Finally, vengance will be mine. I will make the Prince pay for what he has put me through.",""
"55049764-0-7463","Fate brought you to us at this turning point. I'm glad to heed your advice. We must cling to life wherever we find it. You reminded me of that, and I thank you.",""
"55049764-0-7464","Thank you for convincing Erunor to return with us. Thank you so much.",""
"55049764-0-7465","That mage keeps popping up in the strangest places. I'm not sure I trust him. He thinks his boots don't stink, if you take my meaning.nnAnyway, I believe he'd like a word with you.",""
"55049764-0-7466","You're trying to go to Coldharbour? I wish I could go with you. I heard there's islands floating in thin air!",""
"55049764-0-7467","The truth is a bitter pill to swallow. Now go. I don't want to speak about this any more.",""
"55049764-0-7468","Do not hasten towards this final hour. Take the time to appreciate the things you have, the friends you have made, and the world that birthed you.",""
"55049764-0-7469","We'll be by your side for the final battle. In the meantime, we'll prepare ourselves and keep the Amulet of Kings safe.",""
"55049764-0-7470","You needn't make the choice now, but when the hour comes, know that we will stand with you and accept your decision.",""
"55049764-0-7471","I'm not going to tell you to put it out of mind. One of these people is going to have to die for you. Can you make that choice, when the time comes?nnOr will you fail, to the doom of us all?",""
"55049764-0-7472","Farewell, my brave brother. I will never forget you … and the sacrifice you made for our people.",""
"55049764-0-7473","Magister Wulfdis didn't believe me. He said he was going to have me expelled from the guild if you didn't show up. I'm sure glad you did. nnI just hope he doesn't send me out on another impossible assignment.",""
"55049764-0-7474","Good to see you, sera! The Tribual Priests have been kind enough to open their home to us in our time of need. Try not to break anything.",""
"55049764-0-7475","Hmm. This one smells some magic on you. Do you not sense it? Maybe Magrus licks your face while you sleep! Ha! nnWhat is it that you carry?",""
"55049764-0-7476","Praise Vivec! We now possess the six Elder Scrolls. Soon all of Cyrodiil will be ours!",""
"55049764-0-7477","Why, Sameer? Why? You have broken the most sacred tradition of the kingdom!  nnNothing can justify such sacrilege. The law is clear, Sameer. Exile. You must leave here now and never return.",""
"55049764-0-7478","Go now. Lord Varen awaits.",""
"55049764-0-7480","I've run these johads since I was a young man. Damned if I'll see them fall to another!",""
"55049764-0-7481","I welcome you to my father's home. Please excuse our scant hospitality. I've been tending to Naseiran day and night, and it leaves little time to prepare for guests.nnHow may I aid you?",""
"55049764-0-7482","Good to see you, comrade. Hope you've had ample opportunity to batter around someone deserving.",""
"55049764-0-7483","Welcome, comrade. Help yourself to whatever you need.",""
"55049764-0-7484","Welcome, comrade. A pleasure to share your company again.",""
"55049764-0-7485","What is it, comrade? Make it quick.",""
"55049764-0-7486","Welcome, comrade. The Guild prospers with members like yourself.",""
"55049764-0-7487","Whoever paid off the workers wanted the johads to be out of commission. Sounds like the family has some enemies.",""
"55049764-0-7488","Ahh, it's my comrade in arms! Welcome back to the hall!",""
"55049764-0-7489","I suppose I will have to advance Anenya to the rank of Journeyman now. nnGods help us. I hope I don't come to regret this.",""
"55049764-0-7490","Hello hello, comrade! Good to see you!",""
"55049764-0-7491","I'm through being a victim. When my leg heals, I'm heading north, to join the Covenant. Black Daggers won't touch me then.",""
"55049764-0-7492","I feel a measure of peace. I did as much as I could to help my town and the people of Rivenspire.nnReezal-Jul was empowering that abomination. Making it stronger. We would not have been able to stop it without your help. I am grateful.",""
"55049764-0-7493","This one would ask if you have found Saifa, but Zaddo sees it in your eyes. Walk your path well.",""
"55049764-0-7494","The moons speak to Saifa. They tell her of your journey, the ceremony, the choice, and the fire.",""
"55049764-0-7495","You'll make the difference here. I've been out in the field for a while now. You get a sense about these things.",""
"55049764-0-7496","We've never had such a thing happen, coming back to battle against Orcs. I'm not the only one eager to leave right away.",""
"55049764-0-7498","Have you seen my father Nedaegar? He's been missing ever since the Orcs attacked.",""
"55049764-0-7499","Now is not the time for us to speak. Listen to the words of Glaras.",""
"55049764-0-7500","Now is not the time for us to speak. Listen to the words of Glaras.",""
"55049764-0-7501","Now is not the time for us to speak. Listen to the words of Glaras.",""

"55049764-0-7504","I'll feel better knowing I didn't leave the mayor of Crestshade completely on her own.nnRemember, head into town and look for the mayor's house.",""
"55049764-0-7505","We are ready to leave poor Crestshade.  nnWe worry that some touch of the abomination might remain within the items we used to lure and destroy the creature. Bury them here, and let them be forgotten.",""
"55049764-0-7506","I don't know what you did, but the shades are a bit sluggish. We'll hold off the dig until they return to the ground … if they return.nnI should send word back to the Mages Guild. They'll want to know everything.",""
"55049764-0-7507","I'll stay here and warn travelers away from <<Ac:1>>. Don't worry about me, I'll be all right.",""
"55049764-0-7508","What's wrong? What did Varen say?",""
"55049764-0-7510","This <<1>> business is deplorable, so close to <<2>>. No doubt the Mages Guild will take the blame for it all!",""
"55049764-0-7511","You look perplexed. What inscrutable riddles is Varen spouting now?",""
"55049764-0-7512","Sai Sahan wishes to speak with you, Vestige. Be brief. He needs to rest.",""
"55049764-0-7513","I wonder where I should go? What to see? What to do, who to meet?nnIt's a little scary, now that I can do it. But I'll figure something out.",""
"55049764-0-7514","The sooner we can get out of this place, the better. I can't take much more of this kind of magical nonsense.",""
"55049764-0-7515","I didn't cut Sanguine Alendil, but I did make a potion from its flowers. I accept the judgment against me.",""
"55049764-0-7516","Will Uta-Tei return to the Hist, or the graht-oaks of her new forest god?nnAh. Such discussions are better with a drink in hand.",""
"55049764-0-7517","I would never violate the Green Pact. I have lived by it all my life, it is unthinkable.",""
"55049764-0-7518","Activate the portal in this chamber so that the rest of the troops can join us.",""
"55049764-0-7519","Before we left our home, we thought no good could ever come from Elves.nnSometimes it's best to be proven wrong.",""
"55049764-0-7520","I'm not entirely sure what happened, but half of us are dead and we seem to be talking to the Dominion.nnAt least all of the tension that's built up seems to be gone. I have a peaceful feeling from this. We will see what happens, it seems.",""
"55049764-0-7521","I-I remember now. I remember it all! Oh gods! What accursed thing did I do? The spellit trapped me in the tree's form!nnIt was a nightmare! Such was the price of my lust for longevity. But now … now I am released?",""
"55049764-0-7522","Not so much arguing anymore. Lots of my friends gone, though.nnThat makes me sad.",""
"55049764-0-7523","We have crushed our enemies! All Cyrodiil's keeps belong to the Pact. Consult the other boards for tasks, as we have no Warfront missions now.",""
"55049764-0-7524","You've done well. Permit me to tell you a secret, behind which hides another: Any true Shadowscale is also a true child of the Hist.nnThe Hist provides a measure of eternity, true as it also shapes the minds of our people. Think upon this.",""
"55049764-0-7525","Thank you for returning my journal to me. It pains me to think that it ended up in the wrong hands.",""
"55049764-0-7526","This is not how this should have happened … but the Thalmor have said we can stay.nnTime will tell if they come with whip and brand. Then we will know how right Slim-Jah was.",""
"55049764-0-7527","The Argonians are innocent of murderous habits, I hear. Good. May we leave this mire to them and move on. nnIf you need anything from our supplies, do let me know.",""
"55049764-0-7528","The cursed axe worked even better than I expected!",""
"55049764-0-7529","This is even better than I hoped! Think of all the fringe benefits! I don't need to worry about food, water, or even the heat anymore!nnBut most important, I still get to be with my sweet Musi!",""

"55049764-0-7538","An entire room plunged into darkness that we have to cross. Nothing suspicious about this at all.nnLuckily, I have just the plan.",""
"55049764-0-7539","This trial has been hard on all of us. Please help us find closure, advocate.",""
"55049764-0-7540","Your evidence was indisputable, advocate, but it's still hard to believe. Hurry to the judgment cave. The sooner this is resolved, the better.",""
"55049764-0-7541","Forgive Sai Sahan for his anger. Ultimately it was Lyris's decision, and her sacrifice to make. He'll come to realize that, eventually.",""
"55049764-0-7542","We did it. Tamriel will go on. But what a terrible price we had to pay.",""
"55049764-0-7543","So, this is where our roads diverge.",""

"55049764-0-7547","Lead on, then. Take me where you will.",""
"55049764-0-7548","You got one of them, but what about the rest? You have to keep digging! Find the full truth!",""

"55049764-0-7554","Well met! I'm glad to see you survived the battle of Northpoint relatively unscathed. We're going to need you to finish this.nnProvided we ever get started.",""
"55049764-0-7555","Mortal, you stand above the sealed ruins of <<1>>. Within is a gateway to <<2>>, where my priestess <<3>> suffers at the hands of Molag Bal. Her pain is so great, it has torn a hole between worlds.nnThis injustice must end.",""
"55049764-0-7556","Greetings, outsider. As the will of my Prince is eternal, I heed your call.",""
"55049764-0-7557","That was … exhilarating! Nothing like a near-death experience to get Adusa's blood flowing!",""

"55049764-0-7611","<<1>> barred all entry from the cathedral.nnSorry, orders.",""
"55049764-0-7612","The scouts you rescued brought reinforcements from <<1>>. We subdued the townsfolk for their own protection.nnTell me, what happened in the cathedral?",""
"55049764-0-7613","It seems <<1>> held up his end of the deal. I felt his … absence, I should likely say. I was able to open a portal here without any difficulty.nnI tried to tell <<2>> what happened, but he wouldn't listen.",""
"55049764-0-7614","Thanks for saving my hide. They were trying to find a big enough pot to boil me!",""
"55049764-0-7615","And that's why you're my new favorite mortal. When you kill something wonderful, you keep it interesting. Fresh! Dare I say, jovial?nnMakes me wonder if I should stick around, see what wonderful things you'll kill next.",""
"55049764-0-7616","What are you doing here? I don't know you.",""
"55049764-0-7617","It's not fair! I never wanted this, any of this, and now I'm to die for it!nnBut you're reasonable, aren't you? We can talk about this, work something out?",""
"55049764-0-7618","Ah, there you are! The Groundskeeper said you had a pickup. I assume she was talking about this merry band?nnGood to see them alive and well. They are alive … right? Not that I mind the odd zombie. It's the smell I can't abide. Nasty, that.",""
"55049764-0-7619","Do you need directions, hero? The ruins are in the Lorkrata Hills, northeast of Shornhelm, just beyond Traitor's Tor.nnNow get moving. Verandis will meet you there.",""
"55049764-0-7621","And so we've come full circle. I led the original Five Companions on a quest to reclaim the Amulet of Kings. At the time, I told myself it was for the good of all Tamriel. nnI was wrong and now all the world suffers for my hubris.",""
"55049764-0-7622","Zeht's tears, I thought I could handle this! Mannimarco's sorcery brought back all of the pain and doubt I felt inside the Halls of Torment.",""

"55049764-0-7626","I trust you have fulfilled the contract on the Black Daggers.",""

"55049764-0-7629","Varen and I have work to do, but you and I will talk again very soon.",""
"55049764-0-7630","I saw that vampire in action. He's extremely deadly. You're going to have a real battle on your hands when you get up to the house.",""
"55049764-0-7631","You pulled me from the pits of Oblivion. I owe you a debt of honor, small one. And a Titanborn pays her debts.",""
"55049764-0-7632","When the time comes, I will call upon you once more.nnI won't advise you to travel safelyI know you too well. But keep your wits about you, and learn.",""
"55049764-0-7634","My sister-in-law is feeling a little better. She's almost back to her old self and talking up a storm. Thanks to you.",""

"55049764-0-7636","We've done it. We have the ring, and we're one step closer to recovering the Amulet of Kings. We might just pull this off.",""
"55049764-0-7637","The shades seem to have weakened, but that hasn't stopped them from probing this camp.nnDoesn't matter how long it takes, we'll keep the mages safe so they can get back to their dig. Orders are orders.",""

"55049764-0-7645","Thank you.","Grazie."
"55049764-0-7646","Thank you.nnI've lost track of the days. I feel so hollow.",""
"55049764-0-7647","I'll feel better knowing someone went to check on the mayor of Crestshade.nnRemember, head north and look for the mayor's house. That's probably where you'll find her.",""

"55049764-0-7650","Did I overhear correctly? Fahara'jad asked you to go to Evermore? nnSounds like that place is shaping up to be a real trouble spot. I wish I could come along, but the guild's got me doing something else. Probably not nearly so interesting.",""
"55049764-0-7651","I, for one, am very glad Fahara'jad sent you. Many here in Evermore believe the rest of the Covenant has forgotten us.",""
"55049764-0-7652","The attack was sudden and terrible. I don't know what the world is coming to.nnThey didn't steal anything, though, and I still need to make a living. So feel free to browse my wares.",""
"55049764-0-7653","You can't believe how tired I am of getting attacked and chased by those Eight-cursed monsters!nnI just want to go somewhere safe.",""
"55049764-0-7654","Etienne is dead? And, … Squire Theo says the healer is at fault, and dead.nnIt is not truly justice, but it is done.",""
"55049764-0-7655","I'm told there's a dead witch somewhere in the village. Good.nnIt's what witches deserve, when this is what they bring.",""
"55049764-0-7656","I've heard about what happened. All of this death all around us, and you killed her, a skilled healer, too. I'll never understand war.",""
"55049764-0-7657","That huge witchman was the Zurric woman's son? Stendarr's Mercy, at least he's dead.nnDo you suppose she was some sort of spy? Or did she think she was protecting her home?",""
"55049764-0-7658","What a mess. This whole affair … We should just go, put all this death behind us.",""
"55049764-0-7659","Well, good! Now to clear them all out. All of them, from everywhere.",""
"55049764-0-7660","So I heard you killed her son in front of her, then Squire Theo cut her down.nnThat's pretty cold. Be glad she wasn't an orc, she would've torn Squire Theo's arms off and carved her son's name in your chest.",""
"55049764-0-7661","Medya Zurric delivered my brother's children. She was a good woman and you killed her.nnBut my house is still on fire. I guess I don't know what to think anymore.",""
"55049764-0-7662","Medya Zurric was a witch? Well I'm glad she's dead, her and her witchman son! If there were three more of her I'd want them all dead!nnLook at my home! Just look at it! She deserves everything she got, I tell you. All of it.",""
"55049764-0-7663","It seems everywhere I land, you turn up. Or is it the other way around?",""
"55049764-0-7664","Can you believe we're standing in King Fahara'jad's palace? You may have to pinch me.",""
"55049764-0-7665","What do we have here? A legend among heroes! You're looking good.",""
"55049764-0-7666","My friend! How good to see you here. Have a drink with us! Help us celebrate!nnTelonil worked his magic. We have our own ship. We're a crew again. Soon, we'll be back on the sea.",""
"55049764-0-7667","Once again, well met. I hope you are enjoying the warm air of Sentinel. I find it quite bracing, myself.",""
"55049764-0-7668","My friend! My friend. Oh, it is good to see you. I have had the most horrid month.",""
"55049764-0-7669","I hate my life.",""
"55049764-0-7670","The wind and the water smile upon you, my friend. I had not expected visitors. What brings you once again to the Spearhead?",""
"55049764-0-7671","This one greets you, five-clawed walker. Your reputation grows.",""
"55049764-0-7672","Hey, look who it is. I see you're still kicking. I'm glad, but I'm also jealous.nnJust for once, I'd like to leave the boat.",""
"55049764-0-7673","Welcome to the Sisters of the Sand! Enjoy your stay, and let me know if you need anything.",""
"55049764-0-7674","All these clothes. All this jewelry. Whatever is a poor Bosmer to do?",""
"55049764-0-7675","She's gone. Lakana. She was the bravest of us. She was our hope.nnI've heard only rumors surrounding her demise. I don't know who cut her down. But mark me, friend … if I find him, he'll suffer a lengthy death.",""
"55049764-0-7676","Have you come to pay your respects? If so, I thank you. I am glad to see you here.nnNo man should lose his daughter, least of all a king. It is a sad day for Sentinel, but Lakana lives on. She lives now in our hearts.",""
"55049764-0-7677","Hey, good-looking.",""
"55049764-0-7678","At last. We're finally going to explore a real set of ruins, just Neramo and Clanker and me, and Clanker doesn't take a split.nnI'm so looking forward to this.",""
"55049764-0-7679","What an interesting collection of tomes.",""
"55049764-0-7680","You did it. You always do. You have my thanks.",""
"55049764-0-7681","That woman is incredible. She saved my life.",""
"55049764-0-7682","Sentinel. I never thought I'd see it. The world is full of wonders, and thanks to you, I'm seeing them one by one.nnToday, I'm going exploring!",""
"55049764-0-7683","I've never been to a market like this. It's so … quaint. Redguards are remarkably polite, considering the war.nnYou did well on the docks. Quite well indeed.",""
"55049764-0-7684","My friend! Welcome. I want to introduce you to my wife.",""
"55049764-0-7685","I thought my husband was lost. I mourned. Now he is returned to me, and he has told me everything.nnYou have given me back my life and his. Words cannot express my gratitude. Walk with Tall Papa.",""
"55049764-0-7686","Is there a reason you're poking around inside my house? 'Cause I can poke back if I have to.",""
"55049764-0-7687","Thank you for speaking to us, young one.nnWe need to speak among ourselves now. The story you tell is quite … disturbing. Now we must decide if it's true.",""
"55049764-0-7688","As promised, I will consider what you've told me.nnMy thanks to you for bringing this to our attention.",""
"55049764-0-7689","You have spoken. I have listened.nnNow we are finished here. Move along.",""
"55049764-0-7690","I must say it is good to see Queen Arzhela back upon the throne. Hopefully those filthy Reach barbarians won't cut her reign short.",""
"55049764-0-7691","Ah, I have seen you before! Were you not the one who drove the Ra-Netu from Sentinel? nnYes, it is you! A thousand thousand thanks, my friend!",""
"55049764-0-7692","You seem very confused, and I am terribly sorry for that, but I'm not lying to youI've never seen you before.nnI hate to be rude, but if this this is the book, would you mind letting me take it back to the Mages Guild?",""
"55049764-0-7693","Queen Arzhela will make a fine ruler … perhaps better, even, than her late husband.",""
"55049764-0-7694","So the duke was fouling his nest right under my tusks. By Mauloch, I knew something smelled rotten. nnI won't let it happen again. Trust me.",""
"55049764-0-7695","Thank the Eight our queen has returned. nnIt's a small miracle she didn't die of exposure in that drafty old chapel.",""
"55049764-0-7696","The people celebrate now that our absentee queen has retaken the throne.nnUnfortunately, joy won't fill an empty stomach or rebuild a home.",""
"55049764-0-7697","Once <<1>> is secured at the <<2>> Mages Guild, I hope to aid <<3>> in locating her Walking City.nnTo think, I came here to visit a friend. Yet I leave with a great purpose. Does all adventure have such a strange beginning?",""
"55049764-0-7698","So you found those dirty Orcs in Torog's Spite, eh? Good on you, chum. nnNow about these other allegations … I swear I never touched that horse!",""
"55049764-0-7699","Perhaps I shouldn't have used Stibbons' blood …. He must have gotten caught in the spell somehow. Ah well, I'm sure I can figure out a way to undo it eventually.",""
"55049764-0-7700","Impressive … for an outsider.",""
"55049764-0-7701","Well, look at what the wolf dragged in. I certainly wasn't expecting to see you again so soon.nnOf course, you're always welcome here, as far as I'm concerned.",""
"55049764-0-7702","Without <<1>>, the soldiers have released us from service. We may continue our pilgrimage.",""
"55049764-0-7703","So the Imperials want this city? I say let them have it. We can all amble away while they're still busy raking up the bird droppings. Auri-El knows that'll take an army.",""
"55049764-0-7704","Thank the Eight I can see the sun again. nnI'll never look at those birds the same way, though.",""
"55049764-0-7705","Anisha is depressed. All the tasty crows have flown away. Now she must go back to eating bland dungy porridge.",""
"55049764-0-7706","Thank the Eightour long black feathery nightmare is over. Now we can go back to complaining about the gulls.",""
"55049764-0-7707","Captain Hjurrun's just around the wall there at the south gate.nnI wish I could be there to see the look on his face when you bring him that head. It's gonna be great!",""
"55049764-0-7708","By the Three, our rights and duties. Welcome, comrade. I trust your blade has a few new notches in it?",""
"55049764-0-7709","Welcome to the Evermore Guild Hall, comrade. nnThe thrice-cursed Daedra continue to grow in power. You must have the best arms and armor if you are to defeat them.",""
"55049764-0-7710","Hail, comrade. If you happen to slay a daedroth, give it a good kick from me! I'm still nursing a bite wound from my last outing.",""
"55049764-0-7711","Ha har! What's this? Another big-footed pup come up for training? Tell Larhoth all about it.",""
"55049764-0-7712","We can dispense with the small talk. I know why you're here. Even in the nature realm, news travels fast among crows.nnGetting to Uela is impossible though. Even if you break her wards, entering her domain will corrupt your soul.",""
"55049764-0-7714","Don't mind the dustI'm just doing a bit of sorting. nnI understand you're a member in good standing. Would you care to look over my wares?",""
"55049764-0-7715","Hmm … I sense you've come to the Mages Guildhall for a reason. What have you got there?",""
"55049764-0-7716","I had a feeling that was going to end in bloodI didn't know it would be like that, though!nnI feel bad for my guildmates.",""
"55049764-0-7717","My next personal project … I'm going to figure out how to open two portals at once.",""
"55049764-0-7718","You come seeking knowledge, yes? The Mages Guildhall is the place for you!",""
"55049764-0-7719","If you hear anything of Falinesti in your travels, please send word to <<1>>. I expect I'll be traveling with him for quite some time.nnAfter all, I am quite adept at driving off the frost trolls.",""
"55049764-0-7720","You're new, aren't you? I saw you leaving the guest house.nnAnything I can do to ease your transition?",""
"55049764-0-7721","Maybe with this Imperial nonsense taken care of we can get some decent provisions. I was maybe one day away from eating my cat.",""
"55049764-0-7722","Thanks for your help. Make sure you tell my cousin that I'm all right. If you head south, you won't be able to miss the Serk.nnTell her I'll be recruiting new members for the Maulborn in no time!",""
"55049764-0-7723","I was so relieved to get that letter from my cousin. Between knowing that he's all right and performing these good works as a member of the Maulborn, I feel like I'm on top of the world!",""
"55049764-0-7724","Welcome to the Marbruk Mages Guild. We recently established this branch, so we're always looking for new members.",""
"55049764-0-7725","Welcome to the Woodhearth Mages Guild. Are you interested in uncovering the forgotten lore of Tamriel?",""
"55049764-0-7726","I'm no fan of the Empire, but if they can wipe out the Reach clans and send me back to my farm … I don't know. Maybe the duke was right.",""
"55049764-0-7727","It is good that you revealed the duke's treachery, wayfarer. It is unclear what became of him, however. Were we in the Alik'r, his punishment would be both public and brutal. nnI miss the desert.",""
"55049764-0-7728","I hardly thought Queen Arzhela had the strength to preside over a meal, let alone an entire state. I tell you thoughI've never been so happy to be wrong.",""
"55049764-0-7729","Staying in the guest house, are you? I'm sure your induction will go smoothly. Most of them do.",""
"55049764-0-7730","Ah! You're staying with us? How nice! If <<1>> can help you in any way ….",""
"55049764-0-7731","You're new here. Watch yourself, running about and bothering folks. We don't take kindly to nosy people.",""
"55049764-0-7732","I'll recover. Just find the intruders and make them pay!",""
"55049764-0-7733","Greetings, guildmate. It is good to see you still among the living. Take some hard-earned rest or resupplyour battle is far from over.",""
"55049764-0-7734","Well now, that is a relief! To think I might have lived out the rest of my days that way.",""
"55049764-0-7735","Ah, I was told that I might encounter you hereabouts! You do not know of me, but I know of you.",""
"55049764-0-7736","I hear we may be able to return home soon. Is it too much to hope?",""
"55049764-0-7737","Greetings, comrade!",""
"55049764-0-7738","You are the one who brought back Horseman Rolan's sons. I've been eager to meet you.",""
"55049764-0-7739","As always, you're welcome to rest and reequip yourself.nnDon't tarry too long, thoughthere's plenty of killing to be done!",""
"55049764-0-7740","So many things to do! Adusa doesn't have enough hours in the day.nnPerhaps you could lend a hand, my friend. You help Adusa, yes?",""
"55049764-0-7741","Leave me alone. I'm only here for the wine.",""
"55049764-0-7742","I'm just trying to have a quiet drink.",""
"55049764-0-7743","Can't you just leave a man to his drinks?",""
"55049764-0-7744","What can I do for you?","Cosa posso fare per te?"
"55049764-0-7745","The Mad Architect waits below.",""
"55049764-0-7746","You must defeat Uela. Only then can we be free.",""
"55049764-0-7747","You've had quite the glimpse into our world. A bit more then Wyress Freyda or myself would ever be comfortable with, but luckily, for all our sakes, you've proven yourself trustworthy.",""
"55049764-0-7748","Sahan doesn't look well at all. Keep an eye on him.",""
"55049764-0-7749","Oh, it's you. So I guess I didn't really mean what I said about taking your legs off. I mean, you'd get mine first, ha!nnChampions must be busy people, fighting all the time. So, go on and fight! And fight often!",""
"55049764-0-7750","No need to alarm yourself, friend. This is merely an illusion, and all part of the treethane's plan. nnSpeak to Fariel. She'll explain everything.",""
"55049764-0-7751","We've heard a lot about you, Queen's Eye. Have a word with Fariel. She's been waiting for you to arrive.",""
"55049764-0-7752","Thank you for all you've done here. Today has given me a lot to reflect on.",""
"55049764-0-7753","You found them both and returned safely. Thanks to you, I still have a sister.",""
"55049764-0-7754","Stendarr must be in a giving mood today.",""
"55049764-0-7755","I know the Evermore soldiers will appreciate any help I can get. Last I heard, they were spread thin.nnAs for me, I may just take the long way around into Evermore.",""
"55049764-0-7756","I hear we're to be allies with the city dwellers now. I suppose if it saves our home, it's for a good cause. Especially with the added bonus of ridding ourselves of the Reachmen.",""
"55049764-0-7757","I'll caution youdon't expect a warm welcome from my sisters in the north. nnThey are not accustomed to city-dwellers in the wilds, but they need all the help they can get. Whatever it takes to rid these lands of that Hagraven.",""
"55049764-0-7758","This alliance is foreign to us. I think we're all concerned about working together, but at least our common enemy is worth it.",""
"55049764-0-7759","I pray the Wyrd can help me. I don't know what the Reachmen did to me, but this darkness they speak of …. It's as if I can feel it. I've never been so scared.",""
"55049764-0-7760","That must be why Elgenie's poultice didn't fully heal me. I wasn't conscious for a while after they captured me. He had time to … to ….nnIs what Wyress Delphique says true?",""
"55049764-0-7761","What brings you to my husband's grave? I don't think we ever met.",""
"55049764-0-7762","Did Countess Tamrith give you a poultice for me? I could use a little something to dull this pain.",""
"55049764-0-7763","We meet again, ally of the Viridian Sentinel. Now you seek to subjugate these woods once again. We will see if you can succeed.",""
"55049764-0-7764","What do we have here? I think I see a fellow lover of adventure, and I'm betting it's no accident that you're headed this way.nnAm I right? Have Rivenspire's troubles become your troubles too?",""
"55049764-0-7765","Ha! The Baandari scouts said they could see the flames from here! Let's celebrate!nnActually, I hope you don't mind, but I went ahead and started celebrating. After everything that's happened here, I deserved a drink. Silver-Paws did, too.",""
"55049764-0-7766","Don't worry about me. We should keep moving. Can't stop moving.",""
"55049764-0-7767","Oh, look at you! This one tells me you're some big winner. That is … impressive. I am impressed.nnPlease, retire. I should hope to have some chance of your title.",""
"55049764-0-7768","It is done. No one shall ever suffer at the hands of this accursed creation again.",""

"55049764-0-7770","The soldiers must stay here. They must hold this position or all will be lost.",""
"55049764-0-7771","My fellow Baandari said they saw the Imperial boats burning down by the water. You have certainly turned things around here.nnThe Knight Commander was quite eager to start celebrating. I don't mind humoring her.",""
"55049764-0-7772","Thanks for your intervention at North Glen. nnOnce these soldiers recover, we'll mop up any filthy Reachmen that remain.",""
"55049764-0-7773","Stonefalls is lucky to have our strong arms and sharp blades. It must look like home to Molag Bal. At least, that's my explanation for all the anchors.",""
"55049764-0-7774","I've heard some crazy stories, but the way those bandits robbed the townposing as the constable and his deputythat's just pure madness.",""
"55049764-0-7775","I have to say, I'm not too keen on having a mayor that was so quick to compromise with bandits. nnI know they were holding his wife, but … well, that's another reason I'm not getting married.",""
"55049764-0-7776","So the constable's got her old job back? Am I supposed to offer her a toast? I don't think so.",""
"55049764-0-7777","When a woman opens up to you and really lets herself be vulnerable, that's your chance. You just have to take it.",""
"55049764-0-7778","Gods! What happened to Miss Mondorie is so unfair. It could have been any of us too!",""
"55049764-0-7779","Gods! This bread … it's amazing! I mean, I've never had such good bread!nnI think it's the town miller. Ghak really knows his trade.",""
"55049764-0-7780","I've been waiting for my husband to return from Northpoint for weeks. If something happened to him, I just don't know what I would do with myself.",""
"55049764-0-7781","I think the constable should run for mayor. She's a much better leader than that coward of a bureaucrat who currently holds the office.",""
"55049764-0-7782","I'm glad we're all friends again, but my brother's still missing. I have half a mind to march up to Northpoint myself and try to find him.",""
"55049764-0-7783","I thought the mayor had fired Agazu because she was an Orc. Sad as all this was, I'm glad to learn that's not the case.",""
"55049764-0-7784","I'm so glad someone will finally listen to me. My husband never wanted to do anything more than share my bed.",""
"55049764-0-7785","I think the whole lot of those militia ruffians should be strung up from the highest tree!",""
"55049764-0-7786","What happened to Lady Mondorie is unforgiveable!nnSomeone has to do something about Rivenspire's bandit problem. They just have to!",""
"55049764-0-7787","After all this heartache, we're just supposed to forgive and forget? Not likely!",""
"55049764-0-7788","I'm glad Constable Agazu got her job back. She almost drank all my reserves in one night!",""
"55049764-0-7789","I heard the mayor stepped down from office. Who's going to keep the streets clean now?",""
"55049764-0-7790","Thank the moons! As I was just explaining, that thief nearly ran us over. You chased after him.nnPlease, tell this fine keeper of the peace what you saw. I'm still sore from the last night I spent in the stocks!",""
"55049764-0-7791","Not to worry, citizen. This fleabitten scoundrel will not trouble you. Jode's Chariot will see to that.",""
"55049764-0-7792","Now that Shornhelm is secure, we can turn our attention to the reports coming in from the rest of Rivenspire. Something definitely unusual is going on out there.",""
"55049764-0-7793","The Eight Divines are running a little behind.nnWe mustn't mention it when they arrive. It's important to remain polite when in the presence of divinity.",""
"55049764-0-7794","The Light has shown us the way. It has restored Shornhelm and it will see us through to the ultimate defeat of Baron Montclair.",""
"55049764-0-7795","They came into my house. Tried to take my fire from me.nnSo I showed them. The fire is a part of me, now. It will always be inside me!",""
"55049764-0-7796","The priest fears the unknown. That is why he refuses to acknowledge the gift the prince has been given.nnBut why do you submit to this priest's direction? Are you a coward, or do you just prefer not to think for yourself?",""
"55049764-0-7797","The town's safe, I guess. It's a wreck, and nobody who was crazy really seems to be getting better.nnI guess I need to think about my future from this point. But, let's look on the bright side. Look at how many things I have to sell!",""
"55049764-0-7798","Oh, I suppose I heard the mayor did all this. I suppose he must've gone a little mad.nnWe all go a little mad, now and then. Perfectly normal. Do you know when he will be back?",""
"55049764-0-7799","It's at times like these when my commitment as a priest are truly tested. I will support my community and continue prayers until Southpoint is restored to its previous glory.",""
"55049764-0-7800","The constable says my job is just to sit here and look pretty.nnI think I'm doing that fairly well.",""
"55049764-0-7801","If you could find a way to get all those corpses back in the ground while you're up there, I sure would appreciate that.nnI can't make a living if I can't get into the graveyard!",""
"55049764-0-7802","Pardon my saying so, but you are obviously doing well for yourself. What brought you here?",""
"55049764-0-7803","Finally, the town has started to settle down. Maybe I can hear myself think now.",""
"55049764-0-7804","Deepswimmer just went for one more dive! He came back to find this troll eating all his friends!nnPraise the moons you came along! Did you come from the Martyr's Crossing?",""
"55049764-0-7805","Paws of Rajhin tread with you, my friend.",""
"55049764-0-7806","Don't feel bad for me. I got what was coming to me.nnI trusted Peras.",""
"55049764-0-7807","That was a timely rescue. If you hadn't come by, slavers would have hauled us halfway across Tamriel by next week.nnProbably would've learned a lot from the tripwould've seen a lot, too. As slaves.",""
"55049764-0-7808","Thank you for freeing us. I didn't think bandits would ever want anything with a couple of scholars on a boat.nnWhy would you ever board a ship with Peras on it? Come to think of it, why did I?",""
"55049764-0-7809","While you go to Camp Tamrith and help deal with Reezal-Jul, I shall look into the gaps in my memory that you helped uncover. There must be something important in the hills to the east. Why else would the mad Argonian have taken those memories?",""
"55049764-0-7810","I knew my neighbors were innocent! Now maybe things around here can get back to normal.",""
"55049764-0-7811","Of course! You can go to Hallin's Stand! Fabulous idea!nnYes, my friend. The key to driving the Imperials out of southern Bangkorai will be finding and … eliminating the Magus General. If you'll track Septima down, we'll be halfway done.",""
"55049764-0-7812","Whatever's in the crypt, it must be destroyed. Whether it be Imperial, undead, Daedra … just kill it. Kill it all.",""
"55049764-0-7813","It is as they saythe Hollow Moon provides, yes?",""
"55049764-0-7814","You look like someone who appreciates strong leadership. That's in short supply around here, but I'm sure you already noticed that.",""
"55049764-0-7815","A good day at the market! Sula will be so happy!",""
"55049764-0-7816","There's usually not much happening in the village, but today's an exception, isn't it?nnYou don't need to buy anything, do you?",""
"55049764-0-7817","I thought I recognized you! You were right in the middle of those Imperial bastards. nnAnd, hey … didn't you also kill that hag back in Jackdaw Cove? By Stendarr's shield, I'm talking to a legend!",""
"55049764-0-7818","What's taking so long? I can only wait around for so long!",""
"55049764-0-7819","Maybe next time, those maul-brained rock-herders will bring me some food! Squirrels can only last you so long, you know?",""
"55049764-0-7820","Do you smell that? The air here, it's almost sweet.nnBe wary. There are vampires about and that smell means they're on the prowl. It's best you didn't wander alone.",""
"55049764-0-7821","… Can't, I can't … I ….",""
"55049764-0-7822","Self sacrifice is rare these days. I hope Captain Gaercroft is finally proud of his daughter. Not that he wasn't. Perhaps now he'll finally show just how much she meant to him.",""
"55049764-0-7823","His shaking has slowed. Perhaps, when he wakes, he will be cured of his addiction.",""
"55049764-0-7824","Tell me, have you seen my nose? I think it must have fallen off somewhere. I can't smell a thing.",""
"55049764-0-7825","Have you found Puddles yet? She enjoys chasing sheep, so you might look for her near livestock.",""
"55049764-0-7826","You'll find <<1>> standing vigil over his sons in one of the caves.",""
"55049764-0-7827","And what do you want? Come to stare at the fallen warrior?",""
"55049764-0-7828","By the Eight! Can you feel the relic's power, Verandis?",""
"55049764-0-7829","Such foul creatures! I hope no one gets hurt because of me.",""
"55049764-0-7830","And yet again, we will teach someone to guard that which guards its own.",""
"55049764-0-7831","With the Mad Architect gone, I'll admit … this place has a homely look.nnI've work to do. If I could learn what he learnedperhaps I could fill his role.",""
"55049764-0-7832","Have to say, a little violence and mayhem always clears my head. It's exhilirating!",""
"55049764-0-7833","Do you smell that? The air here, it's almost sweet.nnBe wary. There are vampires about and that smell means they're on the prowl. It's best you didn't wander alone.",""
"55049764-0-7834","We shall see to it that the Viridian Sentinel learns what it means to be a guardian of the woods.",""
"55049764-0-7835","Can I finish my prayer please? I think you have things to do.",""
"55049764-0-7836","You are the one who liberated Hallin's Stand, is it not so? Your deeds are known to us here. Ruptga's blessings be upon you.",""
"55049764-0-7837","Thank you, my friend. For all you've done.nnBut it seems our hardship isn't over yet.",""
"55049764-0-7838","Thank you for helping us. There's … not much else you can do.nnI hope Gasteau has a plan. Staying here seems … unwise.",""
"55049764-0-7839","We raise hardy horses here in the Rift, and hardier people. Can I interest you in one of our fine animals?",""
"55049764-0-7840","You'll find no better steed in all the Rift! My Pa breeds nothing but the best.",""
"55049764-0-7841","Condemn these pitiful souls to their fate.",""
"55049764-0-7842","Greetings, walker. This one sees that you have a five-clawed look. You wish to join the Guild, yes?",""
"55049764-0-7843","This place is abysmal. Hardly anything to read. Buzzards squawking day and night. Say … what's that you're carrying?",""
"55049764-0-7844","Hold a moment. What business have you in Bangkorai Garroh. A thousand pardons, I didn't recognize you. Welcome back, sir.",""
"55049764-0-7845","You've been a great help, friend.",""
"55049764-0-7846","This one thinks the knights are lucky the Baandari were here!",""
"55049764-0-7847","I can't thank you enough for ridding Pelin Graveyard of the Prince's treachery. nnIt's bad enough that our knights get killed by Imperial dogs. Having them raised as undead is more than I could bear.",""
"55049764-0-7848","I've hired other adventurers to gather more information for my second book, the Bigger Book of Bloodfiends, but I need you for a special task.",""
"55049764-0-7849","Sleek fighting, walker. You and Crazy Eye make a good team.",""
"55049764-0-7850","Thank you for your help. You've saved many lives.",""
"55049764-0-7851","Watch where you step. Bandit corpses get a little mushy.",""
"55049764-0-7852","The war is far from over, but we've won a crucial battle. Definitely gave the Imperials a black eye. nnAnd Evermore is safe. I should return there, but I have a feeling Emeric will want to press on to liberate Southern Bangkorai.",""
"55049764-0-7853","Is that really my great-grandmother's sword? She was a mighty warrior, or so the stories say.",""
"55049764-0-7854","You have it, yes? The treasure?",""
"55049764-0-7855","We raise fine horses in Davon's Watch. Once sold one to Vivec himself. What can I help you with?",""
"55049764-0-7856","Stay your hand and hear my words. Dominion, Pact, Covenantyou're like schoolchildren fighting over marbles, while the world around you is on fire.",""
"55049764-0-7857","Ah, a hatchling in search of wisdom. Are you acquainted with the Mages Guild, my friend? You would do well to join us. What is it that you carry?",""
"55049764-0-7858","Meet Adusa at Montclair Manor, Five-Claws. It's in Shornhelm's upper city. This one must clean up here first, or Verandis will become very cross. He hates it when we play with our food.",""
"55049764-0-7860","<Cariel's bottle no longer holds a message. It now sits empty, a nonsequiteur for the next passerby.>",""
"55049764-0-7861","I trust we can rely on you to be discreet about your involvement with us.",""
"55049764-0-7862","Sometimes I wonder if such a narrow field of study has stunted my growth as a mage. Perhaps there's more to life than just portals.nnThen I think of how instrumental they were in ending the Blacksap Rebellion. Makes it all worthwhile.",""
"55049764-0-7863","Adusa is so happy she could just purr! The fighting, the blood, the excitementAdusa hasn't had so much fun in an Elf's age!nnAnd, yes, we ended another threat to Rivenspire. That, too. All in all, Adusa had a fine, fine day.",""
"55049764-0-7864","I'm glad you came to your senses about <<1>>. He asked me to verify any ore we find, so here I am.nnLet's get this over with.",""
"55049764-0-7865","What have you found out?",""
"55049764-0-7866","What have you found out?",""
"55049764-0-7867","What have you found out?",""
"55049764-0-7868","You! You were the one who slipped that draught into my mug, were you not? I cannot believe I fell for that. nnThis isn't right, you know. It was the oppressiveness of Redguard society that drove me to become a bandit. Yes. I blame society.",""
"55049764-0-7869","Leave me alone. I'm only here for the wine.",""
"55049764-0-7870","She's warming up to me. I can tell.",""
"55049764-0-7871","You know, now that he's gone, I almost miss the way that bailiff stared at my bottom. No one else around here seems to even notice me anymore.",""
"55049764-0-7872","I'm just trying to have a quiet drink.",""
"55049764-0-7873","I'm just trying to have a quiet drink.",""
"55049764-0-7874","Yes. I would say our experiment was quite a success. I bet you want another one of those trinkets, don't you?nnWell, don't fret. I'm going to craft crates of the things! Look for me on the road. I might even give you one on the house.",""
"55049764-0-7875","Can't you just leave a man to his drinks?",""
"55049764-0-7876","Can't you just leave a man to his drinks?",""
"55049764-0-7877","I'm working up the nerve to go back over to my usual chair at the table. I just keep thinking I hear that bailiff coming back.",""
"55049764-0-7878","What can I do for you?","Cosa posso fare per te?"
"55049764-0-7879","What can I do for you?","Cosa posso fare per te?"
"55049764-0-7880","It may take time, but these traitors will have their day in the sun.",""
"55049764-0-7881","Find that man of mine, will you? Next time he wanders off with the pup, he's going to have to get Xandier to drag him back.",""
"55049764-0-7882","You know, when I was attacked by those wolves, the thought crossed my mind that I might never see my Nathalye again. I … I don't know how to thank you.",""
"55049764-0-7883","<<<1>> bounces back and forth and does a little spin. He looks like he wants you to follow.>",""
"55049764-0-7884","So you're really going up there? Well, better you than me.nnI'll be right here when you're ready to return to Northpoint.",""
"55049764-0-7885","The Eight guide you. The jouney there may not be easy.",""
"55049764-0-7886","Montclair started this war, but I plan to finish it. My soldiers will be ready to move at a moment's notice.",""
"55049764-0-7887","I regret I could not give you more, but I have little. Service to Arkay is its own reward.",""
"55049764-0-7888","I can't believe the Knight Commander's willing to give those bows to those backstabbing Baandari. I'm going to report this to … well, to someone.",""
"55049764-0-7889","I'm very sorry. I wish we could do more for the Garrison.",""
"55049764-0-7890","So the brave Baron Dorell is your choice then. I know he's valiant warrior and I expect he will make a wise and honorable king. nnKing Alard of Shornhelm. It even has a nice ring to it.",""
"55049764-0-7891","As long as there are rotting corpses, I'll have a job.",""
"55049764-0-7892","My aid, Clerk Cantier, should be somewhere near Traitor's Tor. With any luck, he has a solid lead as to the location of the missing Crown of Shornhelm.",""

"55049764-0-7895","We've come through much to reach this point. We won a battle for the very soul of Rivenspire.nnNow comes the responsibility of rebuilding the kingdom. I hope High King Emeric gives me the opportunity to lead us through the difficulties ahead.",""
"55049764-0-7896","It's a miracle that we survived and triumphed over Montclair. Thanks, in no small part, to my steady leadership.nnMay Arkay grant the High King the wisdom to see that I am the best choice to lead Rivenspire.",""
"55049764-0-7897","You have proven most useful, unlike many before you.",""
"55049764-0-7898","Look at that spire. Rather menacing, don't you think? I should be nervous, but the thought of climbing up there … it's pretty exciting!",""
"55049764-0-7899","Interesting item, this Orb of Discourse. I must find a way to use it to determine the location of Sai Sahan.",""

"55049764-0-7901","I'll see you on the other side, my friend. Stay safe out there.",""
"55049764-0-7902","<<1>> is honored! Tell me, what have you brought? Spices? Gemstones, perhaps?",""
"55049764-0-7903","The worst part of ending the Blacksap threat? Now is when I need to be most vigilant. Convincing yourself the snake has no fangs is usually when it learns to constrict.",""
"55049764-0-7904","You were the one who tried to talk me into moving to Shornhelm and doing some honest work, weren't you?nnI am so glad I didn't do that. We're making more coin than I ever dreamed possible now. And to think, I almost quit right before the miracle.",""
"55049764-0-7905","I'm expecting you to come back here with at least a few Reachmen heads hanging from your belt. nnWe can mount them on the city walls. I wonder what Captain Hjurrun did with old Strastnoc's head … we should get that one up there too.",""
"55049764-0-7906","We need to give you a nickname. Something like ""The Knife.""nnHmm. How about ""The Doomsmasher?"" That sounds a little dark, I guess. I'll think about it.",""
"55049764-0-7907","After a long talk with the Countess, it was decided that it would be best if I looked for other employment.nnI think she was just having a hard time dealing with her feelings for me. I expect she'll get all weepy when I'm gone.",""

"55049764-0-8072","Now all I have to do is locate that wildlife specimen Azei calls our pet. If only I'd had that monkey <<1>> stuffed when we first found him, we'd know precisely where he is!nnAh, well. We could always go back to the <<2>> for another if need be.",""
"55049764-0-8073","You actually survived the destruction of the Doomcrag? That's … remarkable.nnI mean, I've seen you do some amazing things. I'll never forget our adventures in Glenumbra. But to walk out of a collapsed mountain? That's really impressive.",""
"55049764-0-8074","You an archer? Nah, I bet you like that personal touch. Axes, right?  nnEither way, I've got a weapon for you!",""
"55049764-0-8075","You've brought my business back to life, wayfarer! Soon this sleepy market will be a bustling bazaar again!",""

"55049764-0-8083","Ruptga bless you for ridding the city of those twice-cursed Imperials. I had planned to poison their drinking water, but I suppose your way … sent a message?",""
"55049764-0-8084","Hm. Perhaps your interest is genuine. I will gladly accept your help. From the size and shape, I would say we need four more pieces. The fisherman claimed he was fishing off the western coast when this stone was found. The others might not be far.",""

"55049764-0-8093","My fellow mages are good folk, but I must confess I'm glad the lock-down is over. If I had to listen to one more debate about the merits of alteration over conjuration, I would have lost my mind.",""

"55049764-0-8258","Well, well, well, look who it is? The second bravest member of the Undaunted.nnCome treat with me, friend! With me and these lovely ladies!",""
"55049764-0-8259","Oh, are you another Undaunted like <<1>>? He is so brave and strong. I could listen to his tales for hours.",""
"55049764-0-8260","Ah, the new blood! You've come far, my friend!",""
"55049764-0-8261","Talisse was just telling us about you. New blood, she called you. Know what would break that unfortunate epithet? Winning a combat tournament.",""
"55049764-0-8262","You are a friend of the Empress of Bone. You will be allowed to live when the Empress destroys this world and replaces it with nothing but bone.",""
"55049764-0-8263","You're not another fool like Felvyn, here, are you? Thinking I'll jump in his bedchamber after a drink? There isn't enough mead in the world for that.nnIsn't enough mead in the world to sate my thirst, either.",""
"55049764-0-8264","I suppose I could construct some Khajiiti statuary, or paint a mural of the Elden Tree.nnI will simply have to speak to some of the dignitaries to see what would fit them best.",""
"55049764-0-8265","The Dominion needs … festivals. Something to bolster faith in the Dominion itself, and celebratory of its formation.nnAnd every good festival needs costumes. Yes, grand pomp for all.",""
"55049764-0-8266","Presently? I am accounting for what goods we have in the embassy, to better monitor future requisitions.nnIf I keep costs low enough, I might be able to hire a replacement for myself, such that I may see some action on my own merit.",""
"55049764-0-8267","You look as fresh as the time I met you, scamp. Does nothing slow you down? I hear you've been making a name for yourself.",""
"55049764-0-8268","This ale's not as good as the grog from the time I ran with Blackheart's crew. But it does its job.",""
"55049764-0-8269","I'm writing my memoirsa record of my great deeds!nnHow about some refreshment, new blood? Hard to write with a parched throat!",""
"55049764-0-8270","I'm looking for work. Know anyone who needs a hauler? I'm real good at breaking down tents, packing them up, and hauling them where they need to be unpacked and pitched.nnAnd don't say carnival. I'm done with carnivals.",""
"55049764-0-8271","I'm terribly sorry, but we our attractions are somewhat limited at the moment. nnPerhaps if you try back in a few weeks?",""
"55049764-0-8272","That's it, then? Seen the world thrice over and none the worse for it, eh? nnYou should be ready for anythingand believe you me, the Daedric Princes never rest. They're always mucking about with something or other!",""
"55049764-0-8273","Greetings, walker! Come, sit by the fire and be welcome!",""
"55049764-0-8274","I don't want to think of the outcome had you not been here.nnYou kept the king safe. You will always be welcome among the Vinedusk Rangers.",""
"55049764-0-8276","The King has been informed of our success. He awaits only your word.",""
"55049764-0-8277","<<1>> … how could this have happened? You had so much greatness within you.nnYour future should have been so very bright.",""
"55049764-0-8278","Things have been a lot quieter around here, lately. It's easier for me to move my adventuring supplies, but there's something I miss about having to break an arm every now and then.nnI think it's the breaking arms part.",""
"55049764-0-8279","I, Boeuf Sterone, have the best food available for miles! How do I know this? Because it is from right here!nnNowhere is it fresher. And it can be so fresh because I no longer need worry about my supply being stolen, so I need not bury it!",""
"55049764-0-8280","Did you know that there was something in those ruins after all? I had no idea! None whatsoever!nnIt's enough to drive me to drink, but I only drink when the sky is blue. Fancy one? A drink, I mean.",""
"55049764-0-8281","I wonder if <<c:1>> is worth all the fuss. I certainly hope the queen isn't wasting her time.nnHmph. And yours.",""
"55049764-0-8282","I don't know you. Fighters Guild facilities here are intended for members only. We've too much to do and too few to do it to spare anything.nnYou should really consider joining us. Our charter benefits all of Tamriel, after all.",""
"55049764-0-8283","Lighting the fire is only part of it, you have to make sure that the guards don't just put it right back out, too!",""
"55049764-0-8284","Do you often storm into the halls of guilds in which you have no membership?nnI assure you, that isn't exactly polite. Unless you're here to join our ranks, of course.",""
"55049764-0-8285","Are you familiar with ""handfasting?"" I'm not entirely certain what it means, but I'd wager <<1>> and <<2>> will be doing it before the month's end.nnBetween you and I, they've wanted to handfast each other since the day they met.",""
"55049764-0-8286","It's good to have <<1>> back in <<2>>. I thought he would be trapped in <<Ac:3>> until I was old and gray.nnBut that isn't the case. He's here, right now. Safe.",""
"55049764-0-8287","All is well. <<1>> is returned to <<2>>, free of <<3>>'s control. Though I admit, I can hardly call her my apprentice anymore.nnNow, we are more like equals. Different roles for us both, but I welcome the change.",""
"55049764-0-8288","I have failed in my duties. Our foes have stolen the Elder Scroll I guarded. Please, recover it!",""
"55049764-0-8289","Find our Elder Scroll, warrior! Seek out those who have stolen it and kill them for this sacrilege!",""
"55049764-0-8290","I heard you're the newest Briar. I'll let you in on a little secret, I was once a Briar too! But I'm too old to rummage around in the forest these days.",""
"55049764-0-8291","Don't just stand therethe Elder Scroll of Ghartok has been stolen! Help your comrades recover it!",""
"55049764-0-8292","You passed the trial? You should speak with Lereluin. My husband is always pleased to meet new Briars.",""
"55049764-0-8293","I am to take Glaras' place when she steps down. I have much to learn and many years to grow before that happens.",""
"55049764-0-8294","I wish I could have stormed <<1>> myself, but I swore my strength to my thane's side. I must resort to indirect measures to protect her.",""
"55049764-0-8296","Hurry to <<1>>. You'll find <<2>> entrenched at the gate to <<3>>.",""
"55049764-0-8297","Be careful in the barrow. Our ancestors went to great lengths to protect their dead.",""
"55049764-0-8298","He went further into the barrow. Be careful. I'll be fine on my own. Put an end to this, and find me in Ivarstead after you do. I owe you a debt for helping me.",""
"55049764-0-8299","I will do a better job of looking after my older brother. He thinks age brings wisdom. Hah!",""
"55049764-0-8300","I call this a successful day. We beat Reezal-Jul and we saved the lovely Captain Janeve.nnYou know what would make it even better? If I can convince all these lovely ladies to join me for a drink at the nearest tavern.",""
"55049764-0-8301","What am I going to do? I have to clear all this rubbish before the end of my shift. Ambassador's orders, they said!",""
"55049764-0-8302","It is no use. The High Elves care nothing about their promises to the Khajiit. Nothing will change, no matter how much we shout!",""
"55049764-0-8303","I thought you were on our side! I mean, after all you did for us … er, I mean …. Never mind.",""
"55049764-0-8304","You're back! Not a moment too soon, all this mead is making me soft around the middle.nnPlease tell me it's time to smash things?",""
"55049764-0-8305","You've returned! My blade is ready. Hunting bandits and enraged wildlife is a poor substitute for traveling with you.",""
"55049764-0-8306","I had hoped you'd return. I enjoyed adventuring with you again. Perhaps you have need of me once more?",""
"55049764-0-8307","Heed my words, friend. There is more to Montclair's betrayal than the Baron and the Countess know.nnI suggest you proceed with caution when you enter the upper city.",""
"55049764-0-8308","So many things to do! Adusa doesn't have enough hours in the day.nnPerhaps you could lend a hand, my friend. You help Adusa, yes?",""
"55049764-0-8309","The brothers and I appreciate your help, my friend! I know this job might have been a little rough, but we're getting better with every contract. You'll see!",""
"55049764-0-8310","You're the only one who isn't a member of this group. Perhaps you will speak truly. The contract specifies they must do the work promptly and effectively. nnI'm not sure what happened, to be honest. Did they do anything worth paying for?",""
"55049764-0-8311","Thanks to you, our reputation remains intact.",""
"55049764-0-8312","I feel better knowing someone is going to try to help the mayor. And I'll go make my report and send more troops this way.",""
"55049764-0-8314","I thank you. Sithis willing, it is not too late to stop the Dominion.",""
"55049764-0-8315","I gave you fair warning. Whether or not you decide to listen, that's up to you.",""
"55049764-0-8316","Did you tell the truth? What are you thinking?",""
"55049764-0-8317","You're smart. Working for the Ring of Daggers has two great benefits. nnFirst, we reward our friends generously. Second, we don't worry about trials and laws and silly things like that. Get Althen to Hoarfrost Downs and he will pay for what he did.",""
"55049764-0-8318","Sagabar and I were just making bets on whether you'd return.nnLooks like Sagabar's a two-time loser. Did you do it then? Did you kill Gavendien?",""
"55049764-0-8319","You brought Gavendien to justice, eh? I'm glad.nnYou know, if you were ever interested in becoming a deputy to the constable. I'm just saying … the job's open.",""
"55049764-0-8320","I hope you made that man suffer. For what he did to Mondorie, he deserved a brutal end. nnDamn bandits. Now I'm just hoping my horse comes home.",""
"55049764-0-8321","Oh. Hello, there. You must be new in town ….nnI'm sorry, but the jewelry shop is closed for today. Constable Gavendien's orders.",""
"55049764-0-8322","I sure do love fishing. Fishing is fun. I could fish all day.",""
"55049764-0-8323","My husband and the others did what they thought was best. Who knew that dreadful Gavendien would go back on his word?",""
"55049764-0-8324","Poor Rubyn! How will he ever get along without his mother?",""
"55049764-0-8325","Poor mother. She didn't deserve this fate.",""
"55049764-0-8327","Have you come to join us for the final push, Lieutenant? We are all that's left of the King's Guard, but at least we'll take a few Orcs down with us.nnAs soon as we see an opening, we're charging into that breach down there.",""
"55049764-0-8328","I guess this is what I deserve. Very well. I accept my fate.",""
"55049764-0-8329","<The wine's aroma makes your mouth water in anticipation.>",""
"55049764-0-8330","I can't believe you recruited Julien. If I could eat my dagger, I would.nnI'm really embarassed. I couldn't manage to get a single recruit, and you come behind me and get all three.",""
"55049764-0-8332","I've told you everything. Let's not do anything hasty, all right.",""
"55049764-0-8333","Well, my friend, it appears that the book is real and not part of Lleraya's illusion. I believe it will be of great help to us in the trials ahead.nnThat said, I have much research to do. Ancient Ayleid isn't my native language, you know.",""
"55049764-0-8334","Ah! A stranger in town. I was just saying how we needed more strangers around here. You know, walking around, bothering people who are just trying to do an honest day's work.nnIs that the kind of stranger you are, friend?",""
"55049764-0-8335","Leave me alone.",""
"55049764-0-8336","The army waits for my signal, out beyond the farms. I want to keep the damage to Northpoint to a minimum. Marching soldiers have a habit of destroying persons and property, even when they're trying to be careful.",""
"55049764-0-8337","I am grateful for your help. I'll steel myself and get out of here shortly.",""
"55049764-0-8338","It's nice out here. No more crawling around crypts, no more undead. No more really heavy armor. No more preaching about Arkay. Nope. No more. I'm done.",""
"55049764-0-8339","This one is glad you are with the Guild at this difficult time. Bear with us, adept.",""
"55049764-0-8340","Go. I need to remain and tend to Darien.nnHe claimed the bloodfiends bit him, but I found nothing but bruises and shallow scratches on his body. I see no signs of the vampire's curse, but I want to watch him to make sure he's all right.",""
"55049764-0-8341","Look around you. Does it look like we have time for idle chatter?",""
"55049764-0-8342","So tell me, what news from Verandis? Has Count Ravenwatch's research finally borne fruit?",""
"55049764-0-8343","Baron Montclair must pay for his crimes. I plan to see to it. Personally.nnI shall gather my troops and prepare to ascend the Doomcrag.",""
"55049764-0-8344","I'm ready. No, I am more than ready! The time has come to put Baron Montclair down like the crazed dog he has become.",""
"55049764-0-8345","Remember, the man that Montclair was is gone now. He no longer exists. Only the monster remains.nnSo don't hold back. Keep him busy until I can join you.",""
"55049764-0-8346","This seems to be <<1>>. She was concerned … she writes about Arlie's sad smiles. Missing me, no doubt. She brought Arlie flowers … and then, they went to the windmill. Oh dear!",""
"55049764-0-8347","I'll miss <<1>>. She was a good … friend.",""
"55049764-0-8348","With Federic back it's going to be harder to keep Arlie's attention. That doesn't mean I won't try, though! My days of sitting idly by are over!",""
"55049764-0-8349","Our home is yours to stay in, for as long as you like. It's the least we can do.",""
"55049764-0-8350","Now that Federic's returned for good, everything will be right again!",""
"55049764-0-8351","Don't worry. I'm not going to try to skip town or anything. If I wanted to do that, I'd have just spit in your eye and stabbed you in the stomach, and gone along my merry way.nnI'm coming … when I feel like it.",""
"55049764-0-8352","Verandis is waiting for you at the Lorkrata ruins. So, what are you still doing here staring at me?",""
"55049764-0-8353","Verandis claims he has a plan to vanquish Montclair, but he hasn't been forthcoming with the details.nnStill, he's dealt honorably with us so far. I'm willing to let him take the lead at this point in the campaign.",""
"55049764-0-8354","I'm going to share a secret with you, Adept. I've always felt a bit of a fraud. My teachers always told me how gifted I was, how brilliant, but I never really believed them.",""
"55049764-0-8355","I had a feeling I might see you here. I wasn't sure if I was ready to face you. nnYou saw me in such a dark moment. But they taught me how to control the hunger.",""
"55049764-0-8356","Wherever she is, I wonder if Heloise is watching all this. I hope she's at peace.",""
"55049764-0-8357","What are you waiting for? Get on your horse and get to the starting line!",""
"55049764-0-8358","You faced down Montclair and lived to tell about it! I'm envious, you know.",""
"55049764-0-8359","I saw you over there at the stocks talking to Martin. Does that fool still think I'm coming to his rescue? He's like a babe in the woods. nnI told him not to wear those fancy boots. It's not my fault he wouldn't listen.",""
"55049764-0-8360","We did it! Now let's get out of here. We can talk more when we get outside.",""
"55049764-0-8361","Look at these peopleyou'd never guess hundreds of people recently died in a terrible war. nnLet them have a moment of happiness, though. You and I know it was only because of Verandis' sacrifice that any of us are still here.",""
"55049764-0-8362","You saved our family and the kingdom, so I guess that makes us doubly in your debt. nnAnd if High King Emeric can choose a new ruler for Rivenspire, my daughter should be able to choose her … preferences as well.",""
"55049764-0-8363","A new ruler for Shornhelm. This is a huge moment for Rivenspire.nnWe should all be honored to witness such a moment.",""
"55049764-0-8364","Can you believe it? She still won't make up her mind!",""
"55049764-0-8365","Hi there. You know, I just noticed that you have really pretty eyes.nnOh, I mean … not that I'm flirting with you or anything. Not unless you want me to.",""
"55049764-0-8366","You know, I think I've decided it's more fun when you don't choose … even when you have to. It's fun having everyone waiting for you to make up your mind.",""
"55049764-0-8367","Go on. Don't wait for me.nnBut thank you, though. For, you know. Helping Verandis. Thanks.",""
"55049764-0-8368","Check with the Baron and see if he has anything to report while I consider our next move.",""
"55049764-0-8369","What word of the Mage and her aspects? We can't afford to let the Serpent control another Celestial Guardian.",""
"55049764-0-8370","I would stand here and drink myself to death, but I can't even afford to do that!nnMy mother told me that if I became a poet, I would starve to death. When I wrote a book, I thought I had proven her wrong. But it's come to nothing!",""
"55049764-0-8371","And like a faithful hound, you follow on the heels of your master. Should I have you sit? Roll over? Beg? Perhaps later.nnFor now, why don't you stand over there and wait for my blessing to begin.",""
"55049764-0-8372","That statue … it's so cold. It feels like the dead of winter.",""
"55049764-0-8373","I can't tell you how much I appreciate you convincing me to enlist. I've come to realize that this is what I was born to bea soldier.nnI also met some soldiers who served under my father. They spoke highly of him. I hope I can honor his memory.",""
"55049764-0-8374","If you decide you want to leave, talk to the captain. I can't think of any reason at all for us to stay here. nnI can deal with thieves, pirates, and all manner of vagabonds, but I'm not getting near any undead.",""
"55049764-0-8375","A finer group of soldiers never served in the Shornhelm Guard. Julien and Shuga have both turned out to be valiant warriors.nnAnd Martin, that young man is a natural leader. He's a war hero now, too. He saved dozens of lives in battle the other day.",""
"55049764-0-8376","Ah! You're one who killed that old skeever Dark Elf I was seeing! What was his name again …? No matter. He's ancient history now. nnI'm sharing a tent with Julien these days, if you catch my meaning. For the time being, at least.",""
"55049764-0-8377","If it isn't Mara's messenger in the flesh! You really saved my love-life. Looking back, I can't imagine what I ever saw in Guendeline. nnKhalisah. Now that's the woman of my dreams! It warms my heart to think she's waiting for me back at home.",""
"55049764-0-8378","So you're headed out to the desert too? That works. I got some timber to sell there in Sentinel.nnI sure as Oblivion better make more off this trip than the price of your fare.",""
"55049764-0-8379","Any time is a good time for a mug of port.",""
"55049764-0-8380","You know what really chaps my breeches? Montclair's troops stole a whole bunch of the weapons I just completed. nnI'll be working for weeks to catch up!",""
"55049764-0-8381","This was once a sacred place devoted to the worship of Akatosh. Now, these sand devils have defiled and destroyed it. It must be cleansed. I plan to call out the Celestial who did this and deal with him.",""
"55049764-0-8382","If you're seeking passage to Ebonheart and points beyond, you'll just have to wait.",""
"55049764-0-8383","I see now what the burnt bones told me. Pain, suffering. And hope. The last bone means hope.",""
"55049764-0-8384","Your help has been invaluable, my friend, but I fear that Craglorn's troubles are far from over.",""
"55049764-0-8385","Bad time for visitors. Lots of omens. Caravans being slaughtered. Hope you're not here to see the sights.",""
"55049764-0-8386","You're back! I was beginning to worry for your safety. Did you find the amulet? Tell me everything that happened!",""
"55049764-0-8387","I'm glad Holgunn sent you. Kyne knows we could use a little luck.nnSpeak to Netapatuu if you think you can help.",""
"55049764-0-8388","Please, do not interrupt me. I must open this for you.",""
"55049764-0-8389","Welcome to the Ouside Inn, traveler! We're the only inn ouside of Elden Root itself, hence the name.",""
"55049764-0-8390","Shornhelm has a new ruler? Well, it's about time! Unless that highfaluting High King wants to spend all his time in Rivenspire, we need someone here who can make decisions and get things done.",""
"55049764-0-8391","The High King actually named a single ruler for Shornhelm? Amazing! It's good to have a proper ruler on our throne again.",""
"55049764-0-8392","I can't believe they gave the crown to that silly young woman! She isn't half as worthy as the brave and handsome Baron Dorell.",""
"55049764-0-8393","I can't believe they gave the crown to that overbearing, pompous bore! He isn't half as worthy as the brave and beautiful Countess Tamrith.",""
"55049764-0-8394","I hear we have our own king again. Well, we know how well that worked out the last time.",""
"55049764-0-8395","So the High King gave the crown to Baron Dorell? Well, that figures. Fancy pants Emeric was never going to award rulership to a woman. That's just not the way it's done.",""
"55049764-0-8396","Greetings and welcome! Do I smell the distinct aroma of ink and parchment? Perhaps an ancient scroll? Or is it a musty tome?",""
"55049764-0-8397","It's a good thing you showed up. I wasn't looking forward to rolling down this hill, trying to get to Kragenmoor before the Daggers.",""
"55049764-0-8398","Any knowledge of enemy tactics is a good thing. Perhaps we can use their little trick against the Covenant. Or get the Goblins to attack their camps. nnI'll leave that to Holgunn. Me, I don't want to ever see another spider again.",""
"55049764-0-8399","Thanks again for retrieving my wares, traveler. I'll make for Kragenmoor soon enough.",""
"55049764-0-8400","I will keep an eye on the barrier, in case anything changes. You go find Walks-In-Ash!",""
"55049764-0-8401","Smell the ash on the wind? That's the wind of change, set to scour the Daggers from our shores.",""
"55049764-0-8402","I apologize for not being able to speak much at the moment.nnMy lovely Celan and I had a rather … rough trip most recently.",""
"55049764-0-8403","Blood for the Pact, eh? Ha ha ha!",""
"55049764-0-8404","Good thing I'm such a patient woman, so dedicated to my oath. Otherwise I'd be wondering out loud why our commander has gone insane.",""
"55049764-0-8405","Ysgramor guide your blade! Hah!",""
"55049764-0-8406","Don't let the name fool you. Ash Mountain isn't a giant pile of ashes. It's much lovelier than that. It's a looming, active volcano. You can smell the brimstone from here.nnSounds compelling, doesn't it?",""

"55049764-0-8475","A word of caution: if you request a post in the Wood Elf frontier, be prepared to eat liver. At least I think it's liver.nnBut waityou're not part of the Mages Guild, are you?",""
"55049764-0-8476","Don't mind the smell. I think one of those creatures relieved itself on the bookshelf. Charming, yes?nnHopefully none of the tomes were damaged. Their loss would be a great tragedy for the Mages Guild.",""
"55049764-0-8477","You look like someone that knows how to handle themself in a fight. We could use the help.",""
"55049764-0-8478","Did you heal the injured?",""
"55049764-0-8479","If you're seeking the Mages Guild, you've come to the right place. If you're looking for more brutish endeavours, I suggest you speak with someone on the other side of the hall.",""

"55049764-0-8483","I spent several hours watching the Wood Orcs and evaluating their weaknesses.nnAs a whole, their strength is in numbers. As long as you don't take on the entire camp, you should be fine. The chieftain's the one you have to watch out for.",""

"55049764-0-8492","Is there anything the Mages Guild can do for you my friend?",""
"55049764-0-8493","I don't know how to thank you. Without your help, the Maulborn would have destroyed the Serk.",""
"55049764-0-8494","There's no time for idle chit-chat right now. If you want to stay, you'll have to be quiet.",""
"55049764-0-8495","Good luck finding lodging! With so many petitioners, the inn's turning people away.",""
"55049764-0-8496","I must admit, your help was invaluable. It may not be a cure, but I can certainly use this suppressant to slow the progress of the plague to a crawl.nnHopefully, that will give me or the healers in Mournhold time to develop a proper curative.",""
"55049764-0-8497","Waiting is the hardest part. But if we trust in the Three, I'm certain everything will turn out fine.",""

"55049764-0-8509","A real Celestial right here in the observatory. It's incredible. What a chance to learn! Do you think she'd obliterate me if I touched her?",""
"55049764-0-8510","Come, mortal. Do a favor for this poor, weary spirit.",""
"55049764-0-8511","Don't let that Saravith talk you into anything. The fact that her spell worked at all and there weren't any strange side effectswell, that was just plain lucky, if you ask me.",""
"55049764-0-8512","You were the one? The one that helped the alchemist? Oh, thank you!nnMy wife hasn't been cured, but at least the plague won't continue to get worse as long as the suppressant holds out.",""
"55049764-0-8513","Greetings. Have you come to the Ashlands seeking glory and honor? The caverns of Stonefalls hold treasure. And danger. And death. nnAhem. Have you heard of them? The Armature? Emberflint?",""
"55049764-0-8514","Old Sorel no longer has any use for these things. Make like the wind and blow, or we shall be forced to exchange harsh words.",""

"55049764-0-8527","<A slightly overcooked turkey leg, suspiciously uneaten.>",""
"55049764-0-8528","What? Yes? Ah. I see, a traveler. Have you come to the Ashlands looking for profit? House Dres applauds your efforts. nnIn fact, we're planning to exploit two new resources soon. Have you heard of the Hightide Hollow? Or Mephala's Nest?",""
"55049764-0-8529","Speak with care as you talk to Helgana, traveler. Her injuries are too great. Her soul will soon be with her honored ancestors in Sovngarde. nnI am just here to see her on her way.",""

"55049764-0-8535","I'm glad we decided to come to the Serk. The town alchemist has been very helpfuleven if she keeps trying to get me to drink sour milk tea. I never developed a taste for the stuff.",""

"55049764-0-8543","Quite an event, isn't it? All the best guests, the wine flowing freely ….",""
"55049764-0-8544","My wife … I think the plague has rattled her mind. I pray that she recovers, but I fear the damage may be too severe.",""
"55049764-0-8545","Thanks for your help. Make sure you tell my cousin that I'm all right. If you head south, you won't be able to miss the Serk.nnTell her I'll return home as soon as I'm able.",""

"55049764-0-8554","Oh, a fellow adventurer, eh? I'm surprised to see you here. I barely managed to sneak past those Iron Orcs. I didn't expect them to have gathered here so quickly.",""
"55049764-0-8555","Talk some sense into that old wizardif you can!",""
"55049764-0-8556","I heard some men talking in the marketplace. They claimed the Iron Orcs are stirring in the northern hills, like they're preparing for something big. I hope it isn't true. We have enough to worry about right now.",""

"55049764-0-8734","Did you talk to Danni about the operation? You know you have to choose someone to join you, right?",""
"55049764-0-8735","Whenever you're ready.",""
"55049764-0-8736","I see you return, friend! Do you return victorious?nnHave you made it to the top of the Aetherian Archive?",""
"55049764-0-8737","You are trespassing on Aldmeri Dominion property. State your business.",""
"55049764-0-8738","We're here, on a secret island holding a covert government prison. Should be fun, right?",""
"55049764-0-8739","I don't feel comfortable about this mission, but we're here. Let's get started.",""
"55049764-0-8740","Xarxes Rebuke. I've heard stories about this place. Dark stories. This isn't a place a person coms voluntarily. But here we are.",""
"55049764-0-8741","Yes? State your business. I'm a very busy woman.",""
"55049764-0-8742","Let's get out of here.",""
"55049764-0-8743","Please, don't tell anyone I'm here. I'll come out, eventually. When it's quieter, and wealthy people aren't likely to threaten me.",""
"55049764-0-8744","Up and about, are we?",""
"55049764-0-8745","I'm sorry, friend. I'm afraid you cannot enter our challenges without a horse.nnDo not worryI'm sure the stablemasters in any city will be happy to sell you one.",""
"55049764-0-8746","Ha! I was worried you'd never wake up. You slept all the way from <<1>>. Right through the hurricane!",""
"55049764-0-8747","Greetings, mortal.",""
"55049764-0-8748","Hm. Talaya thinks you completed this course too easily. She will have to try harder next time.nnPerhaps more … werewolves.",""
"55049764-0-8749","You completed the challenge? Unbelievable. It seems everyone will win a race before Thrauar.",""
"55049764-0-8750","Ah! Don't frighten an old man like that!",""
"55049764-0-8751","Back on your feet already? You needn't offer me gold, I only did what anyone should. I helped someone in need.nnUnlike some people I could point at ….",""
"55049764-0-8752","Quickly! Before the guards spot you!",""
"55049764-0-8753","Always good to see you, my friend. You are like a cousin to me, truly.",""
"55049764-0-8754","My new friend. I am glad to speak with you again. I have much I wish to discuss.",""
"55049764-0-8755","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8756","What? You beat my course? Hm. Well, maybe this one can finally leave this burning wasteland.",""
"55049764-0-8757","I see you've returned. Good for you. One of these days, my luck will change.",""
"55049764-0-8758","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8759","Ah, so you made it? Talaya is relieved. Just in case Ahmat succeeds in convincing the queen to try the course, this one wanted to make sure it was not too dangerous.",""
"55049764-0-8760","You are an impressive rider. I admit it. We should race sometime … after I get a new horse.",""
"55049764-0-8761","My friend. I am Ahmat of the Black Horse Couriers. My assistant Talaya and I have prepared a riding challengea winding course across dangerous terrainand a prize for the fastest rider.",""
"55049764-0-8762","How did you do it? Talaya believed she had designed a course that would be impossible to complete.nnApparently, she was wrong.",""
"55049764-0-8763","Don't come complaining to me. You may be stuck in Coldharbour, but at least you have a horse. Some of us are not so lucky!",""
"55049764-0-8764","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8765","Sleek ride! You have impressed Talaya, and that is not always easy. nnShe slaved away on this course for weeks, trying to make it perfect for these brutish Nords, but they said it was impossible to complete in time. You proved them wrong, yes?",""
"55049764-0-8766","You finished the course already? No fair! Give me a horse and I will finish it in half the time! I'll show you all what riding a horse in Eastmarch is all about!",""
"55049764-0-8767","You completed the course? Wait a minute! What horse were you riding? You'd better not have bought it from some shady little Bosmer!nnThat little bastard stole my horse. I'll find him if it's the last thing I do!",""
"55049764-0-8768","Hold on. This can't be right. Talaya tested this course! No one could have finished it so fast as you have.nnTell the truthyou cut corners, didn't you?",""
"55049764-0-8769","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8770","You completed the course. So what? Anyone could make this run. Talaya made it too easy for all these milk-drinkers. nnMaybe Ahmat should let me design the courses. Yes. I think i'll discuss this with him soon.",""
"55049764-0-8771","Talaya wonders if this is really a good place for a riding course. The Bosmer only like to run around in the foresta and play games.nnThis one is very glad you ran the course. Otherwise, her work would be wasted. So you finished fast, yes?",""
"55049764-0-8772","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8773","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8774","Wait a minute! You finished the course? Already? Did the Wood Orcs just wave you right through?nnTalaya has a hard time believing you beat the course so easily. Are you sure you didn't cheat?",""
"55049764-0-8775","I did it. I can't believe it, but I did it. I stole one of the Wood Orcs' mammoths! Ahmat and Talaya are going to eat their words when I finish the course riding this ….nnNow I just need to figure out how to get a saddle on it.",""
"55049764-0-8776","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8777","No … no! This cannot be! You cannot have completed this course so quickly, so easily! nnTalaya spent weeks designing this. She was convinced that it would be years before someone would do this! How did you do it?",""
"55049764-0-8778","You finished the course, eh? You must be a good rider … not as good as me though. I will prove it too. Soon. nnYes. That Baandari trader should be here any minute with my new horse.",""
"55049764-0-8779","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8780","You finished the course? Already? Bah! Talaya is finished with these Ebonheart Pact lands. The people and the horses are just too tough for this one to design a course that really challenges!nnWas it really so easy for you?",""
"55049764-0-8781","So you finished the course? nnIt's not fair. I don't like you any more.",""
"55049764-0-8782","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8783","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8784","What? You completed the course? This was Talaya's most devious challenge yet!",""
"55049764-0-8785","You completed the course? The Khajiit will not be happy to hear it. I heard her boasting that this course is unbeatable.",""
"55049764-0-8786","Are you sure you didn't cheat? Maybe you asked the mages of Shad Astula for a teleportation spell, hm?",""
"55049764-0-8787","You are a skilled rider. Maybe you can teach old Thrauar a thing or two. I keep getting attacked by kwama or angry Ashlanders.",""
"55049764-0-8788","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8789","Oof. Talaya thinks she overdid it this time. Too many bloodfiends.",""
"55049764-0-8790","In truth, I haven't attempted this race yet. My horse is a little skittish. That's all.",""
"55049764-0-8791","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8792","How did you complete the course so fast? This one got lost no less than 22 times while constructing it!",""
"55049764-0-8793","It's this damn marsh. Everything looks the same. And the horse is spooked by crocodiles.",""
"55049764-0-8794","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8795","Ugh, my poor ribs. You may think this course easy, but the mountains are not friendly to Khajiit claws.",""
"55049764-0-8796","Every time I think I should give up, I remember dear Mother. ""Thrauar, my boy, you are a Nord. You might not be the strongest or the brightest, but no one can take that away from you.""",""
"55049764-0-8797","What is it? Is this about the fish? I took what I paid for!nnUm, never mind. What do you want?",""
"55049764-0-8798","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-0-8799","This one likes this course the best. It is the route she took with her father when he was first teaching her to skulk in the shadows.",""
"55049764-0-8800","I think the Khajiit has used some kind of spell to keep me from winning.",""
"55049764-0-8801","<This Dominion marine is dead.>",""
"55049764-0-8802","Good to see you again. Nice work with Banu.",""
"55049764-0-8803","Go talk to Vexa, let's get out of here. I'll see you back at the Barrows.",""
"55049764-0-8804","This is… a day unlike many. The Shadows have blessed us this day.nnI'm… feeling a little faint, even. Incredible!",""
"55049764-0-8805","I'll meet you back at the Barrows. I'm going to finish my drink.",""
"55049764-0-8806","That pot above me, that's where the tokens are. Look past my shoulder, up on the balcony.nnThat's what you'll need. I'm going to see about slipping inside a different way.",""
"55049764-0-8807","See if you can't get one of the tokens. I'll see if I can't get a disguise and meet you inside. I have a few ideas on how to pull this off, thanks to Danni.",""
"55049764-0-8808","I can't believe the dream is coming true!",""
"55049764-0-8809","Again, I wouldn't let word of what you did to our little Danni get around. Honor amongst thieves and all. Probably a rule you need to know more about.",""
"55049764-0-8810","Least I don't have to up security around here.",""
"55049764-0-8811","I hope Nicolas still has some big plans to continue the guild's worth.",""
"55049764-0-8812","I'm in the middle of a ritual.",""
"55049764-0-8813","Go on. What are you waiting for? You've already got the open invitation.",""
"55049764-0-8814","Welcome, mortal.",""
"55049764-0-8815","Ah, you've returned! I trust that my perfidious acolytes have been properly dealt with?",""
"55049764-0-8816","Go. You are needed at the Fort. The Moons have spoken and will not tell you again.",""
"55049764-0-8817","We leave for Daggerfall. Coming or not?",""
"55049764-0-8818","The Summerset Isles call me back. We're leaving for Vulkhel Guard soon if you need transport.",""
"55049764-0-8819","Though I hate to leave her, work calls back in Davon's Watch. If you need a ride, we're leaving soon.",""
"55049764-0-8820","Hjargredda just returned, but she was too shaken up to say very much. What did you find?",""
"55049764-0-8821","Hello there.","Ciao."
"55049764-0-8822","Little busy here.",""
"55049764-0-8823","Atildel says you're here to help. This one hopes you know what you agreed to. There's some kind of spirit lurking within these cavernsthe Gazers call it a ""Celestial Serpent""it will wreak havoc if it ever escapes.nnYou cannot let that happen!",""
"55049764-0-8825","Captain Whitemane is hold up in Privateer's Pier. See to it that the grave reclaims the cove.",""
"55049764-0-8826","Atildel says you're actually going in there. Do you have a death wish?nnThe Celestial Serpent himself leads the Scaled Court in these caverns!",""
"55049764-0-8827","Atildel said you were planning to enter these caves. I can't believe she convinced you. We've been trying to get her to leave.nnThe Celestial Serpent stalks this place. He has plans for Craglornfor all of Tamriel.",""
"55049764-0-8828","I demand to be set free!nnYou ingrates think this attack on Sanctum Ophidia will go unanswered? The master will digest all of you! Slowly!",""
"55049764-0-8829","Has the little goat finished its work?",""
"55049764-0-8830","I'm sure he just wants to praise you for a job well done.",""
"55049764-0-8831","Well done. Very well done.",""
"55049764-0-8832","Oosh should be just outside my chambers.",""
"55049764-0-8833","Ah, it's good to see you again.",""
"55049764-0-8834","I wish I could do it myself. I'd love to see the life in her eyes drain away and know I was the one responsible.",""
"55049764-0-8835","I admit, I feel wretched in doing this. I had hoped the threat on my life would be over.",""
"55049764-0-8836","Hope you enjoy your stay while you're here.",""
"55049764-0-8837","It's probably about time I got home to get supper ready.",""
"55049764-0-8838","I think I hear a mug of ale calling my name.",""
"55049764-0-8839","I noticed a few clouds in the sky. I hope it doesn't mean rain.",""
"55049764-0-8840","Nice thing about beggin' in the Dale, the people aren't stingy here.",""
"55049764-0-8841","That blasted cat. If she runs off one more time, I'm calling it quits.",""
"55049764-0-8842","Thank the gods this day is almost over.",""
"55049764-0-8843","I love the smell of fish roasting over an open flame. Can't wait to cook up some supper.",""
"55049764-0-8844","What'll it be? You look like you could use a drink.",""
"55049764-0-8845","How exciting was that? Right?",""
"55049764-0-8846","It feels good to be out of that cell. Thanks, mate. Though, really, you didn't have to do that.",""
"55049764-0-8847","You go on ahead. I'm going to stay here to see if I can learn anymore about the Dominion's plan for Shadowfen. Thank you for keeping the keystone out of their hands.",""
"55049764-0-8848","Dominion soldiers here? Have you come to free me or kill me? Whichever it is, do it quickly!",""
"55049764-0-8849","Thank you, thank you so much! You won't regret this, master assassin. I swear!",""
"55049764-0-8850","Be not afraid, my loyal protector. I'm fine. I just … wait.nnYou! It's you!",""
"55049764-0-8851","I heard Marganus' screams. You killed him, then.",""
"55049764-0-8852","You spared the worm, I see.",""
"55049764-0-8853","Atildel says you're willing to head into those cavesface the Serpent. You've certainly got gumption. Might change your mind if you saw what it did to us.nnYou're going to need equipment either way. What do you say? Give me your money.",""
"55049764-0-8854","Did I hear the High Elf correctly? You're going into those caverns?nnWe're in no shape to do it, so you might as well. But you'll need some potent soul gems to take those cultists on. Lucky for you, I have a few lying around.",""
"55049764-0-8855","So you're the one that these two miscreants found, are you?",""
"55049764-0-8856","You're back. How did events play out?",""
"55049764-0-8857","Go, and be careful. They are two of our most skilled assassins.",""
"55049764-0-8858","Better hurry.",""
"55049764-0-8859","Good luck.",""
"55049764-0-8860","I better get back to work.",""
"55049764-0-8862","I just … I just need some time alone. But thank you for helping us.",""
"55049764-0-8863","Banu will pay for this!",""
"55049764-0-8864","That Banu!",""
"55049764-0-8865","Yes, yes. I am the Duchess Sahmanza. You have caught me in a frivolous mood. What can I do for you?",""
"55049764-0-8866","Welcome to my lounge, new friend! What can the Duke of Tigonus do for you?",""
"55049764-0-8867","In the name of His Royal Highness, as representative of his name, I greet you. What may I do for you?",""
"55049764-0-8868","I would avoid mingling there if I were you. Getting close to people at a funeral to add yet another death to their toll can't be good for the mind. And yours needs to be clear.",""
"55049764-0-8869","Stendarr defend me!","Stendarr difendimi!"
"55049764-0-8870","Thank Jone and Jode. This one thought today would never come.nnHe will tell his children about you.",""
"55049764-0-8871","Another Dark Brother? You're not expected here.",""
"55049764-0-8872","By the Eight, you're alive! You've been gone so long. I was beginning to think I should have tried harder to keep you out of the ruins.nnBut tell me, was what I feared true? Was the Scaled Court harvesting more nirncrux?",""
"55049764-0-8873","My dear friend, I must apologize profusely for our rude treatment of your most delicate person. Please understand that no offense was intended.",""
"55049764-0-8874","Speak with my sister, Oosh. She will direct its first test.  When it has completed the test, it will meet me for its second test.",""
"55049764-0-8875","Good luck. You'll need it, my friend.",""
"55049764-0-8876","You're back? What did you find? No. Better you tell Scattered-Leaves first. He's been waiting for you to return.",""
"55049764-0-8877","Jarl Kalgar keeps himself pretty well protected.",""
"55049764-0-8878","I don't like that look on your face. It's bad, isn't it? No, I don't want to hear it. You should talk to Scattered-Leaves.",""
"55049764-0-8879","You're back, but where's Camaarie? Oh no, not Camaarie!",""
"55049764-0-8880","You look like you've seen a ghost. What's happening?",""
"55049764-0-8881","You have a determined stare. What have you seen?",""
"55049764-0-8882","You saw something awful out there, didn't you? Well, at least you made it back in one piece.",""
"55049764-0-8883","Now, I have a great task for you.",""
"55049764-0-8884","Ah, a commoner. Good to see that the Headman wants to mix things up. You'll fit in well.",""
"55049764-0-8885","You're back! Excellent! I was just about to look for someone to send in after you.nnBut tell us true, were you successful? Neither Veesk nor I would blame you for running away from that terrible monster.",""
"55049764-0-8887","Oh, hello dear! Welcome! You now stand among the most important people on the continent. We all gather for the signature season, the Reveltide of Tamriel!",""
"55049764-0-8888","Find those caches as quickly as you can. This goes on much longer, we'll be fighting the cult with nothing but bricks and foul language.",""
"55049764-0-8889","Oh, it's so good to see you! I'm glad you're here!",""
"55049764-0-8890","Our carts overflow with more wounded than tradegoods these days. And for what? More gold! nnThe price of prosperity is high. Too high, if you ask me.",""
"55049764-0-8891","I can feel the darkness within you, my child. Have you been ushered into Sithis's embrace?",""
"55049764-0-8893","I can see the mark of Sithis within its eyes. It is welcomed into the family.",""
"55049764-0-8894","Greetings.","Saluti."
"55049764-0-8895","And so the hero returns. I should have known you were the one to free us. Nerien'eth single-handedly trounced useven as the entire school stood ready to face him.nnBut if someone could defeat him it would be you.",""
"55049764-0-8896","Your choice is backed by my will. Speak to my new Listener, the one who will shoulder the burden anew.",""
"55049764-0-8897","Wrath. You have done much for the Brotherhood.nn…Thank you. I don't mean to be so formal. I'm still adjusting.",""
"55049764-0-8898","The Wrath speaks, a voice of merit above many.nnFrom the Night Mother to the Wrath, through the Listener, be honored: you have performed admirably.",""
"55049764-0-8900","Whenifyou succeed, I would speak with you before you leave. I'll wait by the docks.nnFear not. No Tenets shall be broken. After all, you honor Sithis with your deeds.",""
"55049764-0-8901","You know what they saywhen the Void gives you lemons, squeeze 'em into someone's eyes.nnOr is it ""squeeze someone's eyes into 'em?"" I think both could work, if you put your back into it.",""
"55049764-0-8902","""Whoosh."" Elf capons.nnHeh.",""
"55049764-0-8903","Hope the mission went well. I heard screaming, but couldn't tell if it was out of sorrow or pain … or horror. Plenty of emotions at a funeral!",""
"55049764-0-8904","Have you seen Taara's ""charnel gown?"" A full suit of armor, complete with a closed helm! Leave it to soldiers to eschew funereal silks.",""
"55049764-0-8906","If you see Eamil embarrassing my family name, I give you leave to slap the smirk from his face.nnNo hestitation. Just a sharp smack.",""
"55049764-0-8908","Taara will soon be with her ancestors. Auri-El bless us all.",""
"55049764-0-8911","I hope Norion can forgive me.",""

"55049764-1-141","These Bloody Eyes weird. Something about protecting veal? Why you protect food?",""
"55049764-1-142","Hah! You see them runs away from me?",""
"55049764-1-143","We dids it! Doogie sleep well now I think.. thanks much to you!",""
"55049764-1-144","You've done us all a great favor, friend. Please, speak to Tamarus. I believe it is time he told you the truth.",""
"55049764-1-145","You fought well. You should join us, as one of our guard!",""
"55049764-1-146","The battle of the flesh realm has been won for this day, yet the battle within the Veil will always continue.",""
"55049764-1-147","Since I lost my brother within the Veil, I've searched for purpose.. but today I found it. Thank you, stranger.",""
"55049764-1-150","So, you're back again? Can't say I am surprised... where would the high and mighty go today?",""
"55049764-1-151","Warden Godwin gave you a letter? Good enough for me. Where would you like to go?",""
"55049764-1-152","Feel free to take a look around, traveler!",""
"55049764-1-161","Thank Arkay you were here. I would have perished alone.",""
"55049764-1-162","What business would a hero like you have with me?",""
"55049764-1-163","Thank you for your kind words. I'm going to pray for my father.",""
"55049764-1-164","I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood to talk right now.",""
"55049764-1-165","I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood to talk right now.",""
"55049764-1-166","While I appreciate you retrieving my valuables, I can't stand around all day singing your praises. Leave me to my troubles, of which I have plenty, thank you.",""
"55049764-1-168","We must recover Ranser's body before our enemy puts it out of reach forever.",""
"55049764-1-171","You have proven useful, to both the Magis Order and Camlorn.",""
"55049764-1-172","Thank you for your kind words. I'm going to pray for my father.",""
"55049764-1-173","You retrieve Daloran's coin purse from the body, but it is empty of gold.  What you find instead are a set of well-worn bone dice, and a debtor's slip for an alarming sum.",""
"55049764-1-175","Have you found the Third Squad's missing soliders?",""
"55049764-1-176","I now know what we must do. Once again it falls to you, my friend.",""
"55049764-1-177","Your soul has been fouled by the filth of Cold Harbor. nnYou should rest in Arkay's light.",""
"55049764-1-178","Hey, it looks like you've killed a bunch of goblins!",""
"55049764-1-181","I see Wyress Jacinta has sent us a hero. We welcome your help. The poor, tormented spirits of Westtry are quickly becoming a force beyond our control.",""
"55049764-1-182","You found it!  Please take it to Shaelle.  She's at the big tree, now.",""
"55049764-1-183","Seeing Westtry in ruins no doubt hastened my parents' deaths.",""
"55049764-1-185","So you've met Thetis the Poisoner, eh? Lazy as they come, he is.",""
"55049764-1-187","With heroes like you on our side, we may stand a chance of stopping this war. I must be away, soon, but first I will answer any questions you might have.",""
"55049764-1-188","That good-for-nothing wastrel!  Hours late as usual... what do you want?",""
"55049764-1-191","I overheard your conversation with the cleric. You bring grave news.",""
"55049764-1-192","Madier and I came up through the ranks together. If it wasn't for the burden of command, I'd be with him. I pray he's all right.",""
"55049764-1-193","You killed him! The Duke of Camlorn is dead because of you. How do you expect to keep all of Glenumbra from falling to the werewolves without his guiding hand?nnDo you really think you can save us now? Do you?",""
"55049764-1-194","Cleansing the tarn will take a long time, but you're certainly started purifying the land.",""
"55049764-1-195","So you found the Werereaver. I think the Danains would approve of you using it. Wield it well, <<1>>.",""
"55049764-1-197","Did you stop the Blackhand necromancers?",""
"55049764-1-198","Point the amulet at people in Aldcroft. It will reveal if someone is a werewolf or not.nnIt pains me to say this, but pay special attention to the refugees from Camlorn. I don't believe they're all what they appear to be.",""
"55049764-1-199","Sibellec is unconscious.",""
"55049764-1-200","Once we find out what is behind the changes to the Mud-cloaked Hags, I shall turn the tide against those who have taken my swamp!",""
"55049764-1-201","Shava can smell that you've found some humors for her.",""
"55049764-1-202","We must investigate the Cave of Penance. We must find the Ehlnofic Lens.",""
"55049764-1-204","Please take my burial vase to Camlorn. It rests to my left.",""
"55049764-1-205","Faolchu's army is falling before us. Soon, Camlorn will be ours again.",""
"55049764-1-206","Glad to have another hero guarding our flank. Watch the rotting teeth on those wolves, though. Stendarr only knows where they've been.",""
"55049764-1-207","We'll handle the rest, and we'll help Camlorn rebuild. I'm certain you now face bigger challenges.",""
"55049764-1-208","I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood to talk right now.",""
"55049764-1-209","I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood to talk right now.",""
"55049764-1-210","You have a Gravebinder's spirit, friend. I thank you for helping redeem this place.",""
"55049764-1-212","I'll never be able to repay you for what you've done. nnHowever, I can offer you some advice: don't travel north.nnThings are much worse up that way, or so I hear.",""
"55049764-1-213","Yes? You look like you've got something on your mind.",""
"55049764-1-214","Ah, good to see you again, my friend.  Venison stew tonight, you're welcome to join us.",""
"55049764-1-215","Spriggans roam the forest around the Dresan Ruins. Be careful. Those monsters were nearly the death of us.",""
"55049764-1-216","Any friend of Wyress Ileana is a friend of mine. What brings you to our camp?",""
"55049764-1-217","That's the spirit! What have you got?",""
"55049764-1-218","Have you found a suitable harpy egg?",""
"55049764-1-219","Never have I seen the spirits of earth, water, and air appear in the same place at the same time. You are truly remarkable!nnPray tell! What knowledge did they bestow?",""
"55049764-1-220","I hope you were able to stop the Rock Biter's poison from reaching the people of Aldcroft. It would afflict them as it has afflicted us.",""
"55049764-1-221","Have you harvested some hawthorn seeds for me?",""
"55049764-1-222","You found him? Why, thank you so much. You should stay a spell. Tomas will be right along with dinner.",""
"55049764-1-223","Did you find my wife's locket?",""
"55049764-1-224","You want to ask me about a locket? Where would you have found such a thing?",""
"55049764-1-225","Could I... be free...?",""
"55049764-1-226","After the Wyrd Tree is released from its corruption, Angof's power in High Rock will wane.nnAll hope now rests with you, champion.",""
"55049764-1-227","Thank you for delivering these tools. We'll put them to good use.",""
"55049764-1-228","I appreciate you delivering those tools. We can't work without them.",""
"55049764-1-229","Thank you for the tools. I just wish you'd brought us some weapons!",""
"55049764-1-230","I'm glad to see you alive. Is it done?",""
"55049764-1-235","Thank you for returning our family ring. It is invaluable.",""
"55049764-1-246","Soon, we can return home.  Thank you for returning the Wyrd Tree to us.",""
"55049764-1-248","Are you from the past or the future? The truth is hazy these days.",""
"55049764-1-249","Home! I can go home again! Blessings of the forest on you, <<1>>!",""
"55049764-1-251","You must do what you think is right, of course.",""
"55049764-1-252","Thank you so much for the safe return of my ring. Let me know if there is anything I can ever do for you.",""
"55049764-1-255","I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood to talk right now.",""
"55049764-1-256","I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood to talk right now.",""
"55049764-1-257","I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood to talk right now.",""
"55049764-1-260","I'm glad to hear you handled the spriggan problem, though I'll probably lose some business because of it.",""
"55049764-1-262","I am almost certain we have nothing to say to each other at this point.",""
"55049764-1-263","You will find Melodian Fiannalor to the east of Varyllis, beyond the Stonewake.",""
"55049764-1-264","Take care not to spill any of the liquor on yoursefl! It may have rather adverse effects.",""
"55049764-1-265","Excellent work dispatching the Sload, Numinous.",""
"55049764-1-266","You will find Sapiarch Lilia at the Kinhouse to the south. This road will lead you there.",""
"55049764-1-267","Do speak to High Kinlord Langdruun at the Felballin Kinhouse. He should know of our successes.",""
"55049764-1-268","Have you restored the Aquiferi to their subterranean abodes?",""
"55049764-1-269","Once you have destroyed an Aquiferi Elemental, collect its Pith and bury it in a Fissure.",""
"55049764-1-270","We have but one more task in front of us - restoring the Lens to its rightful place above the Kinhouse.",""
"55049764-1-272","I heard they sent you out into the swamp to meet that witch. nnWas she as strange as everyone says she is?",""
"55049764-1-273","After you've been out in that swamp for a while, you'll probably need a new pair of boots.",""
"55049764-1-274","I want to help Camlorn anyway I can. nnStill, I don't know how I would have dealt with that witch. She unnerves me.",""
"55049764-1-275","I heard you helped Sibellec, but at what cost? nnSome say she's as bad as the wolves.",""
"55049764-1-276","So many strange things live in that swamp. nnWas Sibellec as odd as the Bretons say she is?",""
"55049764-1-277","The witch helped you? nnThen I guess we're one step closer to getting rid of those confounded refugees.",""
"55049764-1-278","They say you met Sibellec. nnYou know what my friend said? He said she turned him into a toad!nnDon't worry. He got better.",""
"55049764-1-279","You say Sibellec isn't all bad? I don't know about that. you wouldn't believe some of the stories I have heard...",""
"55049764-1-280","You've done so much for us. You went out into the swamp to help us. nnThank you.",""
"55049764-1-298","Thanks to you, we're fighting one hopeless battle instead of two.",""
"55049764-1-300","At last! We no longer have the swamp rising up against us. Now we can focus on the real enemy.",""
"55049764-1-304","Now that we've dealt with the swamp, we should be ready to storm Camlorn.",""
"55049764-1-307","Is it just me, or are there less of those hideous swamp creatures now?",""
"55049764-1-308","I'm growing accustomed to this place. I really hope we can help these people.",""
"55049764-1-310","I heard you met Sibellec. Did she try to eat you?",""
"55049764-1-312","The Starglass has been echo-instilled? Excellent! It must go to Lalathal at the Kinhouse at once!",""
"55049764-1-313","The Pallid Devils bombard us night and day. Would that something could be done!",""
"55049764-1-314","Maormer corruption has surely mazed my senses. I see and smell the bloody prize you carry, but I do not believe it.",""
"55049764-1-315","Our Varla Lens is returned, and not a moment too soon. For my people and my Kinship, I give you thanks.",""
"55049764-1-316","Do you hear that, Optimate? The ocean. You have dulled the roar of the Siege Engines. I can hear the crash of the waves once again.",""
"55049764-1-318","We will not fail Glenumbra.",""
"55049764-1-319","The Spellfire Pillars must be disabled.",""
"55049764-1-320","Do you bear the Starglass I've been expecting?",""
"55049764-1-321","You must be quick to harvest the Discarnates before they cease to be a menace!",""
"55049764-1-322","Have you checked on my soul gem?",""
"55049764-1-323","Camlorn won't remain in General Faolchu's clutches for long.",""
"55049764-1-324","I can't wait to return to fighting something that's easier to get the drop on.",""
"55049764-1-325","Rolantae waits for you on the knoll to the southeast.",""
"55049764-1-326","The Chamberlain means well, but he is used to a different living standard than the rest of us.",""
"55049764-1-327","The Military Camp Apothecary tries her best, but sometimes a good old-fashioned cure is all a patient needs.",""
"55049764-1-328","Who would you rather trust? A trained apothecary such as myself or someone else?",""
"55049764-1-329","Have you tried the device yet? Which way did the thief go?",""
"55049764-1-330","Have you managed to find my former love, Coren? Did you find my locket?",""
"55049764-1-331","Aha! There can be no doubt, you are Phynaster reborn! A job well done, Numinous.",""
"55049764-1-332","I sense tragedy....",""
"55049764-1-333","Leave me so that I may finish what I have am resolved to do.",""
"55049764-1-334","Can I assist you somehow?",""
"55049764-1-335","Did you find the grave? Did you honor my father?",""
"55049764-1-336","You saw her, didn't you. I can see it in your eyes!",""
"55049764-1-338","Your aid has been invaluable, my dear Optimate. I shall pray that Mara allows me to bless you in the future.",""
"55049764-1-339","News of our success here will soon reach Alinor. You should return there and seek audience with Queen Ayarynne.",""
"55049764-1-341","<<1>> returns. Tell me Optimate, what news have you?",""
"55049764-1-342","Orgnavar is an infernal device of the Sload!",""
"55049764-1-343","Again, I warn you, simply touching this book will harm you. Only take it if you are ready.",""
"55049764-1-344","Please, speak with Suuniqwe, she will not listen to me. You will find her to the east, north of the Shadow's shrine.",""
"55049764-1-345","What happened on the island? I haven't sensed any changes in the Midnight Talisman. Its power remains dormant.nnTell me. Were you unable to make contact with the spirits of the land? Did they refuse to bless you?",""
"55049764-1-346","Have you spoken to Vendialara? She can be found just north of here, at the space overlooking Studium Vale.",""
"55049764-1-347","You've returned! Already the vines that choke Cath Bedraud wither and die. I can only pray this means you were successful.",""
"55049764-1-348","The Numinous returns. Have you the Varla Lens?",""
"55049764-1-349","Turned to stone, in the Imagerie… at least the location is thematically appropriate.",""
"55049764-1-350","The Orrery will survive this invasion. Thank you for your help.",""
"55049764-1-351","I am glad you found the survivors of the expedition. I only wish my fears had proven unfounded.",""
"55049764-1-352","Oh, my. So the Blackhand is harnessing the power the Welkynd stones. It's worse than I thought... if that's even possible.",""
"55049764-1-353","Blessed arrows! Thank you for bringing those in. We're running low.",""
"55049764-1-354","Arturo left Daggerfall years ago to make a name for himself. He rarely sent word home to me.nnI want to know what happened. Did he die in that horrible mine? Was he slain in a tavern brawl? Where is my son?",""
"55049764-1-355","Have you managed to recover my tools, Optimate?",""
"55049764-1-356","Did you retrieve the talisman? Is it safe?",""
"55049764-1-359","I can't help but wonder what that catwoman will do now to ruin my life and my work.",""
"55049764-1-360","You will always be welcome in Varyllis, Optimate.",""
"55049764-1-361","My apologies, but perhaps I was unclear. Did I not inform you that Battlereeve Nenwe desired to meet you? She is encamped above the Tessellated Shores, along the eastern coast.",""
"55049764-1-366","The air is thick with the seeds of Angof's corruption. nnWhy are you here?",""
"55049764-1-367","Vines clog my veins and film stains my eyes. nnWhy are you here?",""

"55049764-1-373","How goes the hunt, <<1>>?",""
"55049764-1-374","I must admit, I did not think you would best the mighty Kirin. Truly you have proven yourself, <<1>>.",""
"55049764-1-377","I heard someone searching through my things the other night. Gave me quite a scare. I thought it was one of those spriggans!nnThe next day, I heard the Thierry family's ring was stolen. Do you think there's a connection?",""
"55049764-1-381","<<1>>, do you have any more information on the Red Rook bandits?",""

"55049764-1-388","Once you have recovered the pieces of the crown I ask that you take them to Talrien the Archivist, who toils within the bowels of the Umbral Tower. The building sits on a lone island along the southern edge of the bay.nnYou may go now.",""
"55049764-1-390","You did well to stop the Great Elum, but I fear it was the least of our concerns. Much more urgent problems still threaten High Rock.",""
"55049764-1-391","You would make a great addition to the Fighters Guild.",""
"55049764-1-392","Can I assist you somehow?",""
"55049764-1-393","Ah, the Serpent's killer. What can I interest you in today?",""

"55049764-1-404","The beast this feather came from must have been a sight to behold!",""
"55049764-1-407","Any luck finding my pickaxe? My father gave it to me, and I can't go back to work without one.",""

"55049764-1-430","Would you favor us by playing the Sacred Instrument near at hand? Be not bashful.",""
"55049764-1-431","Such a vision you are. What brings you to my Shrine, my dear Numinous?",""
"55049764-1-432","What? What? What? Too slow! What?",""

"55049764-1-469","I heard of your deeds in the Fane. Perhaps the Queen was not rash in her choice to name you an Optimate.",""
"55049764-1-470","I'm certain Duke Nathaniel resents my success at Alcaire Castle. nnIf it wasn't for Duchess Lakana, he would have run me out of here by now.",""

"55049764-1-482","I can see it in your eyes. I'm turning. Becoming one of those … things.nnNo! I refuse to give in to despair! I want to live, gods damn it! I want to live!",""
"55049764-1-484","Finnegan's not the type to renege on his word. I fear the worst.nnLook for Finnegan and Cray along the northern road. It leads through the Wracked Plain to Shornhelm. You may run into survivors of the last battle. Help any of our people you can.",""
"55049764-1-485","I am not a fool. We can't win this war without aid, yet I will not sit here twiddling my thumbs while every fool with a weapon endlessly contemplates whether to fight or flee.nnTake up arms or stay out of the way.",""

"55049764-1-497","I have yet to hear news from anyone in <<1>>. I have no idea how they fare.nnThe Mages Guild is spread too thinly across Rivenspire, if you ask me. Of course, it's not my place to plan our strategies. Excuse me while I return to my books.",""
"55049764-1-498","I don't know who I really am any more. Part of me is still alive, in agony. A part of that … abomination!nnIf Reezal-Jul were in front of me right now, I swear my hate alone would tear that lizard to shreds!",""
"55049764-1-500","Why do you delay? A case of fear hasn't come over you, has it? nnLady Eselde eagerly waits back in town. Strike down Montclair, and House Tamrith will raise Shornhelm to newfound glory!nnDo this, and you will truly be a champion of House Tamrith.",""

"55049764-1-510","Magharz' scouts sent you, didn't they? nnI told him to let me go. I can't allow him to be shamed in front of his people. nnWe were foolish. Everyone makes mistakes, but rarely do they cost so much. nnHe must let me go.",""
"55049764-1-511","Don't forget. We're watching you.",""
"55049764-1-512","I see you've found Inwold's secret. He refused to show those poems to Dabienne - but he could not part with them, either.",""
"55049764-1-513","We wouldn't have survived without your help. Thank you.",""
"55049764-1-514","I can feel the pull of his influence. The closer I get to the cave, the more control he has over me.",""
"55049764-1-515","There is still another soul that needs your help. Seek out <<1>> near the town square. Help him get over his grief.nnOnce all the defender spirits have assembled, we can end this once and for all.",""
"55049764-1-516","Montclair should suffer, just as he made others suffer from the blood fever.",""
"55049764-1-518","Whoever <<1>> is, he must be stopped. nnI won't let him terrorize all of Rivenspire with his undead horde!",""
"55049764-1-519","I knew more of my fellow knights would come to see the insanity Sir Croix means to unleash at Alcaire Castle. nnI think we have enough knights now to retake the keep. I've sent them to take up strategic positions.",""
"55049764-1-520","Moira's Hope has been destroyed? nnSeems like we're on our own. We'll make it … somehow.",""
"55049764-1-521","Now that the poor soul's body has melted a bit, it is easy enough to retrieve the artifact from his grasp.",""

"55049764-1-525","Blood and glory, my friend. Blood and glory!",""
"55049764-1-526","Huh? All three of you are buying me an ale? I thank you all!",""
"55049764-1-527","How goes your treasure hunting? Any fantastic Aldmeri treasure, yet?",""
"55049764-1-528","I'm glad we could help each other. May the Divines walk with you, friend.",""
"55049764-1-529","It is good to see you returned safe, my friend. Did S'Rashi yield any useful information?",""
"55049764-1-530","The moors will always be haunted, but thanks to you, I won't have to shout to be heard over the spirits' wailing.nnI suppose my wife, Frelie, will be expecting me to help defend the town now.",""
"55049764-1-531","I allowed my Duchess to be murdered in our her own bedroom. I have failed my Duke and all Alcaire.nnI pray to Akatosh I am allowed to redeem myself.",""
"55049764-1-533","I hope this is the right decision. I'd be lying if I said I didn't still have some reservations, but I suppose this'll at least give me a chance to earn some coin.",""
"55049764-1-536","I never thought Julien would feel the same way I do.nnThis isn't a trick, is it? I'm a blacksmith. I have a hammer, you know.",""
"55049764-1-539","The talisman and the power it represents has corrupted countless hearts and minds.nnIt is a blight upon this world and the ones who would wield it.",""
"55049764-1-540","The weakness is spreading.... nnPlease, stop them before it's too late!",""
"55049764-1-541","Well? Now that the foolish experiment with the braziers has failed, has the king come to see reason? Does he realize this fight cannot be won?",""
"55049764-1-542","S'rashi wants to help Captain Marck too, but S'rashi must pay Midnight Union boss, yes?nnHelp S'rashi get the money he needs and all will be well.",""
"55049764-1-543","Sounds like you've got an even livelier party than usual in there.",""
"55049764-1-544","They're whooping it up even more than usual in there.",""
"55049764-1-545","Go on, get to the game! We have so little time left. nnOh, I do hope you have fun!",""
"55049764-1-546","It was a pleasure to do business with you. Please, return and visit me in a few years. I'd love for you to see my new pet!",""
"55049764-1-548","Stay alert, citizen.",""
"55049764-1-549","The people here are so uncooperative. You'd think that after all Wayrest has done for them, they would show a little more respect.nnI'm of the opinion that we'll never recover the Crown of Shornhelm!",""
"55049764-1-550","The Bloodsworn lurk in the chambers and corridors of the Doomcrag. They're followed closely by their guardians. nnBe sure to rid them of their guards first, lest you find yourself facing creatures even you could not defeat.",""
"55049764-1-551","You've done what no mortal man has done. You've entered Cold Harbor and returned alive.",""
"55049764-1-552","Is someone there? I can't see you.nnEverything's so dark.",""
"55049764-1-553","You've done it!  Now all you must do is take Ranser's crown, and put us all at last to rest.",""

"55049764-1-556","My ritual worked, didn't it? I felt it. Azura's messenger came to you, just as she came to me.nnShe will save Gavaudon. She will save us all!",""
"55049764-1-557","It's bad outside these walls, but Shornhelm isn't faring much better. Political warfare on the inside, disease-ridden beasts on the outside.... nnYou go on ahead, I'll make sure Finn's wounds are treated.",""
"55049764-1-558","Please, leave me to my grief. Let me mourn my wife.",""
"55049764-1-560","I heard what happened to the Nirine woman. Thank the heavens you were there to talk some sense into that poor, crazed man.",""
"55049764-1-561","Tell that so-called doctor... if I see him again, I will not hold back. For now, I just want to be with my Charlotte.",""

"55049764-1-566","You're the one with the map, yes? Tahra mentioned you. Come, let's see it!",""
"55049764-1-567","Ah, you are the one with the map! Tahra informed me of your coming. Let us see it, hm?",""
"55049764-1-568","You live? Appearances can be deceiving, it would seem.nnWell done. Lady Eslede waits to speak to you. For House Tamrith!",""
"55049764-1-569","Stay safe. You are destined for great things, but if you fall prey to this evil, I fear we will follow you into the darkness.",""
"55049764-1-570","Borkul has already dispatched some Blackmauls to Wayrest for supplies.",""
"55049764-1-571","Follow the beach south. Walk around to the west to find <<1>>. nnIf you don't take the long way around, you'll find yourself fighting through a horde of Imperials.nnForewarned is forearmed!",""

"55049764-1-578","You smell terrible. nnWait! You must have the samples I requested. Yes?",""
"55049764-1-579","Where's Heloise? Is she all right? Does she need help?",""
"55049764-1-581","Hey. Funny kind of luck I have, eh?",""
"55049764-1-582","The Swamp Cypress appears to be hovering over a fallen Seedling - protecting it. One of its branches is extended, pointing to a Mound of Dirt to the east.",""
"55049764-1-583","The Swamp Cypress creaks.",""
"55049764-1-584","Look along the northern shore for any useable equipment.nnBe careful of the crocs, though. The scent of fresh blood has drawn more of them.nnThey're frenzied and voracious.",""
"55049764-1-585","I would not wish my fate on anyone, but I am powerless to stop it.",""
"55049764-1-591","You'll find a bunch of Imperials west of Southpoint. nnYou should be able to identify them by their incredibly ugly mugs.",""

"55049764-1-598","Follow each tunnel in this pit to a room.nnThen destroy the infernal device core you find inside it. nnHack it, blast it, kick it... it doesn't matter as long as you destroy it!",""
"55049764-1-599","Please, find the rest of the Hinaults. They couldn't have gone far.nnAnd remember, if any of them have been killed, you need to burn their bodies and collect their ashes.",""

"55049764-1-3240","We're going to be allowed to leave, aren't we? nnIt's over. I can tell.",""
"55049764-1-3241","Thanks for letting me know. Now report the tunnel collapse to Godrun down at the entrance to Shinji's Scarp.",""
"55049764-1-3242","The world of the living has trangressed. The energy of these relics was used for darkness. nnThe portal is closed, but something came through. It must be destroyed.",""
"55049764-1-3243","There is always danger in being a pirate, but how was <<1>> to know that it would be from one's own captain?",""
"55049764-1-3244","The ship is to the south. Save <<1>>, please!",""
"55049764-1-3247","Do you see? Do you see what I've become? Look at the reflection! nnI'm old. I'm fat. And sometimes Argonian! No one will ever admire me again!",""
"55049764-1-3248","I'm sorry. You'll simply have to excuse me. I'm getting to know myself and I'm not who I thought I was.nnYou can see it too. Just look. Look in the mirror.",""
"55049764-1-3250","You still here? nnJust tell that crazy Ashton I don't want any more of her worthless stones! nnDo you hear me?",""
"55049764-1-3251","Just passing through, traveler? I'm about to head out myself.",""
"55049764-1-3252","I hope to find new business soon or I'll have to relocte my shop.",""
"55049764-1-3258","What's the point of opening my mouth to speak?nnThere's nothing I can say to end this torment, so I'm just going to stop talking. I mean it.",""
"55049764-1-3259","I appreciate you doing this for me. My wife made me promise to get the refugees out of Crestshade and keep them safe, but I can't stop worrying about her.nnCrestshade is directly north of this camp and our house is right in the center of the town.",""
"55049764-1-3262","You can thank me for ""losing"" her soul gems.",""
"55049764-1-3263","The cultists who captured me must have trapped my father with the same enchanted sleep. They cast that same spell on me!nnOh, he must be suffering so much from the nightmares!",""
"55049764-1-3265","The Covenant thanks you for joining the war effort! With talented crafters like yourself at our back, there's no challenge we can't overcome.n nAkatosh bless your wares, friend.",""
"55049764-1-3266","Please … go away. They're going to see you!nnI'm not coming out until I see a head.",""
"55049764-1-3267","It does not surprise me that you have succeeded thus far, for you bear the Viridian Sentinel's favor. Now closing the portal is all that remains.",""
"55049764-1-3268","You should not delay, <<1>>. Drahir knows you want to kill just as much as he does.",""
"55049764-1-3270","What do you have there, <<1>>?",""
"55049764-1-3271","The Huntress has gone too far! This was a temple of innocents.nnWe could use your help, but I don't want to leave these monks unaided. Have you spoken to the Grand Master?",""
"55049764-1-3272","I'm busy. Leave off, vagrant. Find your own hole.",""
"55049764-1-3274","You know what amazes me? As muddy as these pigs get, they're still cleaner animals than the cows.nnYou know a cow will stand in its own waste for days. Won't even move unless you make it.",""
"55049764-1-3275","Was there some kind of incident up in front of the countess's manse?nnI've been trying to avoid that area lately. It simply reminds me of my failures.",""
"55049764-1-3276","I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to stand here? It's the countess's property, and she certainly hasn't said anything.nnSo yes, I'll just stay here as long as I like. Thanks!",""
"55049764-1-3277","A summons was recently sent ordering all Knights of the Flame to return to Firebrand Keep.nnFor now, though, I feel my duty is to remain here. Sir Hughes will understand.",""
"55049764-1-3281","Keep heading back to the north-east. You'll find our Treethane in the central most home.nnHe'll want to hear about how easily you stumbled upon this town.",""
"55049764-1-3283","These new mercenary guards have done wonders for my sense of security.",""
"55049764-1-3286","That poor soldier. He swore he would just scout the area and return immediately. He didn't intend to fight alone.nnI'll need to tell his family.",""
"55049764-1-3289","I cannot describe the sensation, even as a spirit, of being back in my father's presence.nnFate was cruel to us in life, but at long last, we've both found peace. Thank you.",""
"55049764-1-3290","You returnand I sense a diminishing of the evil 'round the tower. nnHow did you fare?",""
"55049764-1-3291","If this deal turns out to be a waste of my time, someone's going to pay for it.",""
"55049764-1-3292","Looks like you've got quite a load of raw ebony. <<1>> will be quite pleased with you, I imagine.",""
"55049764-1-3293","I'm acting on orders directly from Sir Hughes. If he wants to make an exception, he'll let me know in due time.nnUntil then, the envoy stays out!",""
"55049764-1-3294","Again, you must keep this quiet. The Duke is already overwhelmed and hearing about a spy inside the castle might push him over the edge.nnGet past Sir Gregory and into the library, find out who ""Almandine"" is, and report back to me personally.",""
"55049764-1-3295","I hope Baroness Edrald doesn't actually believe Arlie was dragged off to some Daedric plane.nnI've lived here a long while, and I've seen some strange things. But every time someone's child is ""abducted by Daedra,"" it turns out they've eloped.",""
"55049764-1-3299","Together at last! Thank you, stranger. Now I beg you one final favor - a proper burial, as every decent person deserves.nnThe shrine is due north of here, at the entrance to the mine.",""
"55049764-1-3301","The ogres will double their numbers if you go against them with too many folks at once.nnI'm heading back. That's safer for both of us.",""
"55049764-1-3302","Yes! I smell them! Delicious, crispy, tasty, bloody. Scamp skins! Give!",""
"55049764-1-3303","If you die in this endeavor, we will not weep. Not for an outsider.nnSucceed, though, and my tribe will welcome you as clanfriend.",""
"55049764-1-3304","I hate to say it, but I'm going to have to speak with the duke about this. The fact that the duchess is sending secret letters to her father is serious cause for concern.nnWe need to know exactly what they're planning though.",""
"55049764-1-3305","It is a relief to see you returned. I fear I might have asked too much. nnTell me though, did General Thoda have any new insights into the source of these assassination attempts?",""
"55049764-1-3306","Still no sign of Mister Nurin? I told youhe's goneprobably burned up in the fire.nnMy heart goes out to the rest of the family, but I have to look out for myself. I'll have to find a new job!",""
"55049764-1-3307","I'm glad you came along. The constable's down by the docks. If he won't listen to reason, try to find the messenger from Alcaire Castle. He can explain everything.nnIf you can get me released, the Knights of the Flame will be in your debt.",""
"55049764-1-3308","So the crew of the Midnight Swell is innocent!  I'd hate to think Lucas fell prey to the slavers that attacked that ship.nnWhat does that mean for Koeglin Village? I hope Sal has a plan.",""
"55049764-1-3309","Fire, scamps, William disappears, and now strangers on the property…nnThe farmhands all gave up. Maybe I need to give up too. The farm's lost, and my sweet William…",""
"55049764-1-3310","I gave the constable the message, but he doesn't seem to believe me.nnHe put Dame Dabienne in the stocks. Glad I'm not her!",""
"55049764-1-3311","Guards! Guards! Arrest these people!nnThey're setting up the village! The slavers are going to come back and take us all!nnWhy aren't you listening to me?",""
"55049764-1-3313","If his treatment of my crew had not been so disrespectful, I might feel a little sorry for the constable.nnAs it stands though, I'm quite enjoying this.",""
"55049764-1-3314","Were those Daedra death screams I heard? Music to my ears.nnAnd you destroyed those damnable portals too. I think now we'll be safe.",""
"55049764-1-3316","I can't tell you what a relief it is to learn that Pascal's mind is messed up.nnI guess that sounds a little strange, doesn't it?nnRegardless, I'm grateful for all your help.",""
"55049764-1-3317","Heard you were out there talking to that knight in the stocks. nnI'd be careful if I were you. Constable will lock you up too. Sit down and have a drink instead. What'll it be?",""
"55049764-1-3320","You did it. You even got him home in time for dinner.nnIt weighs heavily on a mother's heart to worry about her son. I can't thank you enough.",""
"55049764-1-3321","I'm with dad on this. I want to wipe every remnant, every trace of those sick freaks from our farm.nnIt's the only way we can start over.",""
"55049764-1-3322","I told you! I don't know anything. Go away!",""
"55049764-1-3324","As embarassing as my mother may be, it breaks my heart that she worries so much.nnIt's good that we've put her mind at ease. You should talk to her.",""
"55049764-1-3325","The Knights of the Flame are sworn to protect me and my family. How can I trust any of them now?nnFirebrand Keep is to the southeast. Go and bring Sir Hughes to justice. Let none stand in your way!",""
"55049764-1-3326","My daughter is back, thanks to you. nnShe seems none the worse for wear, though she's hesitant to talk about it. I have a feeling I'm better off not knowing.",""
"55049764-1-3327","So you're the one who destroyed that tunnel? Good work.nnThat'll give those filthy ogres something to think about!",""
"55049764-1-3328","Here we go again. I'll be hearing about this for yearshow I failed to save our son in his darkest hour, and oh, thank the Eight for that stranger ….nnI guess it could be worse.",""
"55049764-1-3329","Well done! Frankly, I thought we'd be peeling you off the bottom of a rock, but hey, you made it!nnNow's our chance to drive the ogres back into the mountains. We can end this thing! I don't know why the general's hesitating!",""
"55049764-1-3330","If <<1>> wants to know about the battle, he should just come out and see for himself.nnWhat? Is he hiding or something?",""
"55049764-1-3331","Hm. You don't look so dangerous. Yet, you waltz into my camp and pick fights with my soldiers?nnTell me why I should not simply cut off your head where you stand?",""
"55049764-1-3334","You … you did it. nnAlready, I can feel peace coming over me. Soon, I will be … asleep.",""
"55049764-1-3335","Checking in on your old friend Manard again?nnHow … thorough of you.",""
"55049764-1-3336","You didn't really get ogre teeth for <<1>>, did you?",""
"55049764-1-3338","Of all the ports and over all the years, never a worse time and place to be stuck ashore.nnFifty crates of grain bound for Rihad, but right now, it's just rotting in the hold.",""
"55049764-1-3340","Sir Hughes decided to let that Redguard envoy in to speak with the Duke, and the soldiers went back to their camp.nnSo things are quiet here … for now.",""
"55049764-1-3342","They gobbled down my house key, those little devils. Cut them open until you find it.",""
"55049764-1-3343","Ma'jhad's so angry right now. Only the captain ever said those kinds of things about her. I'm afraid he's going to kill the first mate before she can escape.nnPlease, you've got to help her.",""
"55049764-1-3344","This is all wrong, all of it.nnThe sooner we find out who's responsible and restore the duchess, the better!",""
"55049764-1-3345","There are still others who need your help. Look for <<1>> near the town square. Help him, so he will be free to help us.nnOnce the defenders of Crestshade are assembled, we'll face the abomination.",""
"55049764-1-3346","Hey, you're not going into the warehouse, are you?nnConstable promised me that if anyone got to go in there and paint the walls with slaver blood it would be me.",""
"55049764-1-3347","Welcome back to the Hall, my friend.  Our librarians are anxious to pore over your discoveries!",""
"55049764-1-3349","It would be wise not to speak of this with anyone - especially not the members of House Indoril.nnWe both know what you did was right, but an outsider might question our judgement.",""
"55049764-1-3357","My husband, Sir Gregory, suddenly wants to take me to Wayrest. How very sweet of him!",""
"55049764-1-3360","Blackhearts dead! Dead!",""
"55049764-1-3361","Thanks for bringing me word about my sons. They're good hunters, almost as good as their sister.nnIt's a father's right to worry about his children, isn't it?",""
"55049764-1-3362","I'm sure my father's still worrying about me, but I'll be fine.nnNow that I know what to expect from these cats, they'll be dead soon enough.",""
"55049764-1-3363","Tell my father not to worry so much.nnRolan and I can handle ourselves in the wild just as well as Jehanna can.",""
"55049764-1-3364","Are the Dorrells looking? I bet they're looking.",""
"55049764-1-3365","I hope the Divines will watch over Shela and keep her safe. She's so brave.",""
"55049764-1-3367","Rumors sweep through <<1>> like the desert winds - they say the captain is slain, now and for all time!nnIs it so? You have done this thing?",""
"55049764-1-3368","The Duchess must be kept safe. I will stay here while you speak with Sir Hughes.nnI hope he will send additional security to protect her.",""
"55049764-1-3369","King Fahara'jhad will never forget the loss of his beloved Lakana, but I hope this man's death will bring him some sense of peace.",""
"55049764-1-3370","A crime was committed and the price had to be paid. I wish it could have been otherwise, but I have done my duty as you chose.",""
"55049764-1-3372","My husband's a little hard of hearing. Not quite in touch with reality either. He thinks he killed that scamp, but it was actually our cat.nnBless his heart though, he certainly means well. Just play along if you will.",""
"55049764-1-3373","Are there any more scamps down there? Bring them on, I say! 'Scampkiller' is my middle name! nnI can still wield a blade just like when I was a young man. Just watch!",""
"55049764-1-3374","Even if you speak the truth, I have no knights to spare. People plot against me in my own home. They're rioting, furious at my love for Lakana.nnI will protect her, and I will protect my people. You will leave it at that.",""
"55049764-1-3376","You've saved my husband. I can't tell you how grateful I am!",""
"55049764-1-3377","There was no luck in this, you know. I believe Stendarr sent you to us in our time of need.",""
"55049764-1-3379","Now that we're associates, allow me to introduce myself properly. I'm Count Hosni at-Tura. I'd like to invite you to my estate, where we will celebrate my betrothal.nnYou've whetted your appetite for blood. You know you want more. Join us, won't you?",""
"55049764-1-3382","You're alive!nnIt's true, then. <<1>> has finally been defeated!",""
"55049764-1-3383","I am simply a bailiff here. If you want to help, seek out Constable Agazu. You can find her around the town square.nnBut if you add to our woes, stranger, you shall have to answer to me.",""
"55049764-1-3385","We meet again, <<1>>! I never doubted that you would find your way here.nnOur reunion is fortuitous. Again, we find ourselves in need of your talents.",""
"55049764-1-3386","These Knights of the Flame, they insult King Fahara'jad by refusing me entry. nnI have an urgent message for Duke Nathaniel and I am a close friend of the Duchess. I cannot understand why the Knights are so stubborn.",""
"55049764-1-3387","Verandis is dead. I thought he would outlive us all.nnThis is strange. Should I be upset or sad? I think I should just feel relieved for him.",""
"55049764-1-3388","I apologize for doubting you. You are indeed a worthy duelist.",""
"55049764-1-3389","You're stronger than I expected. You have my respect.",""
"55049764-1-3390","I wouldn't have expected such skill-at-arms from an outsider, but I saw you dueling over there. nnGeneral Thoda did too and he would like to speak with you. You will find him through the door.",""
"55049764-1-3392","The <<1>> is the last champion left. nnYou know, I think I'll wish you luck.",""
"55049764-1-3394","May the Herdmother crush all harpies beheanth her cloven hooves!",""
"55049764-1-3395","We have you to thank for my neighbors' freedom. Our families bless you.",""
"55049764-1-3398","Judging by the smell, you're carrying spider ichor, and a fair bit of it, I'd say.",""
"55049764-1-3399","Why did we listen to Veraya?nnWe should have been more suspicious of an outsider who wanted to see our shrine!",""
"55049764-1-3400","One day, I'll be a master smith. Then I'll make the best swords in the land.",""
"55049764-1-3401","Hurry, <<1>>!nn<<2>> must be stopped!",""
"55049764-1-3402","Spirits of my line, watch over me.nnGuard me and give me the strength to reclaim our home.",""
"55049764-1-3403","By my bones, I have not felt so rotten since the day my kin of the horse tried to teach me to ride. I was thrown to the ground. I felt broken for weeks!nnI can only hope Jonnedor doesn't feel that same pain.",""
"55049764-1-3404","Forgive me. I am not my usual self.",""
"55049764-1-3405","Now the arena champions are dead, I assume you plan to take their place. nnIf not, there goes the business.",""
"55049764-1-3406","I heard the count's having those prisoners released.nnNo bad thing, if you ask me.",""
"55049764-1-3407","Fair weather today, except for the Nords everywhere. nnDo you need passage?",""
"55049764-1-3410","Is it done? Have you avenged my brothers?",""
"55049764-1-3411","We surely would have perished in that cave if not for your heroics, <<1>>. Thank you.",""
"55049764-1-3412","<<1>> is contested by all three alliances of Tamriel. It's a constant battlefield. Dangerous, yes, but this may be an advantage.nnReinforcements are constantly being sent to Balfiera. You should have no problem joining up and shipping out with them.",""
"55049764-1-3414","The dead cannot hold a soul fast. In his greed, Karnosis left these bodies alive, but soulless.nnUse the Soul Gem from the <<z:1>> to transfer the souls from each <<z:2>> to a nearby body. Once the soul is anchored,  destroy the body to send it on.",""
"55049764-1-3415","It's all so much clearer than before. The visions come bolder than ever! But have I spoken well, I wonder? Have you understood what I've seen?",""
"55049764-1-3416","I'll keep an eye on my brothers. Use the apple to encourage the foals to return home.",""
"55049764-1-3417","Ah, it's you! Did you enjoy that apple? There's more where that came from, friend.nnOnly one sample per customer, I'm afraid. You'll need to pay for anything else you buy.",""
"55049764-1-3418","Before you can reach Shiri, you'll have to unseal the vault. Destroy <<1>> and <<2>>. Then collect blood from their undead husks.nnYou'll also find two of the three Ansei Wards on the fallen liches. Perhaps you can save them from their fate.",""
"55049764-1-3419","The quickest and safest way to get to Evermore would be by boat. One of the harbormasters outside of Sentinel can help you with that.nnYou will most likely find <<1>> on the docks in the city. I've heard it's the best place to find information.",""
"55049764-1-3420","I told you everything I know. Talk to Martine.",""
"55049764-1-3421","Was that a fight I heard? Looks like you didn't need any help.nnLeveque's likely still up there. Go get him.",""
"55049764-1-3422","That's a mixed bag if I've ever seen one.nnWe have little time to train them, but train them we must.",""
"55049764-1-3423","I'd get that information to <<1>> right away. It's probably important.",""
"55049764-1-3424","<<1>> is the one to talk to.",""
"55049764-1-3425","As I said, talk to the Captain about any suspicions you may have.",""
"55049764-1-3426","I made it this far. We hillmen are as stubborn as we are strong.nnDid you find what I need for the cure?",""
"55049764-1-3428","Use the portal and speak to <<1>>. You'll find him in Sentinel.",""

"55049764-1-3430","Alik'r is in your debt. Thank you!",""

"55049764-1-3433","What news? The safety of the royal family depends on this.",""
"55049764-1-3434","Friends can be expensive.",""
"55049764-1-3435","<<1>>, you have done so much that I could not. I do not question your reasons. Greed or glory, or anything between the two, is reason enough for me.nnShall we take the last steps up the tower together?",""
"55049764-1-3436","I mourn the creatures you were forced to kill. They usually aren't so aggressive.",""
"55049764-1-3437","I'm taking my family to Daggerfall. We'll be safer there.",""
"55049764-1-3439","I will always remember Daggerfall's champion.",""
"55049764-1-3440","Assassins in my port? Thank Tall Papa you were here.",""

"55049764-1-3443","A swineherd's life isn't easy, you know. But my pigs love me.",""
"55049764-1-3445","Hold, stranger. If you're going toward Shornhelm, you're doing it at your own risk. nnAs much as I'd love to tell you the Shornhelm Guard will keep you safe, that's just simply not the case. We're spread thin and trying to regroup.",""
"55049764-1-3446","I know why you're here, but where I got that amulet is a discussion for another time. nnJust be careful. The werewolves won't appreciate having their secrets revealed.",""
"55049764-1-3447","I never thought it would come to this. A civil war has begun in Rivenspire. Finn and I are all that's left of Shornhelm's militia.nnWas Oldgate attacked? Do their defenses still hold?",""
"55049764-1-3448","You're looking for someone? I'm keeping records of who survived and who was lost.nnGive me the name, and I'll let you know if he or she survived the attack.",""

"55049764-1-3451","That's everything. I'll have my guards get ready.",""
"55049764-1-3452","Be careful out there. Red Rook bandits might be anywhere.",""
"55049764-1-3453","Talk to the captain. She's in charge.",""
"55049764-1-3454","I'm glad you got out of there without too much trouble. Did you get rid of their posters? I don't want more desperate farmers turning to banditry this close to Daggerfall.",""
"55049764-1-3456","We were able to get all the villagers through the portal. They're safe in our camp for now.",""

"55049764-1-5151","Small guild representation out here at Fort Amol, isn't it? It's good to see another member in the area.",""
"55049764-1-5152","Good to see more guild members in the area. We don't have much of a hall here, but members are always welcome.",""
"55049764-1-5153","Leave me. I told you what you wanted to know.nnYou'll see. You'll see how the lizard fails. Just you wait. I know what I'm talking about.",""
"55049764-1-5154","What are you, my mother?nnGet out of here. You're ruining my me time.",""
"55049764-1-5155","What can Laughs do for you? You need something special?",""
"55049764-1-5156","I'll never forget what you and Stormy did for me.nnYou saved me. Both of you.",""
"55049764-1-5157","So, are you going to give me the salts or what? I really need them.",""
"55049764-1-5159","Ah, you again. Veldrana's been regaling us with your heroics. Captain Viveka led a Riften Guard patrol out here. We're following up.",""
"55049764-1-5160","Ahh. I'm getting the feeling back in my toes. Ow! Pins and needles! Pins and needles!",""
"55049764-1-5162","Remarkable. I'm not easily impressed, but you've done it.nnUricantar, on the other handwhat a waste. Truly.",""
"55049764-1-5163","Without your help here, the tale of Andewen in Ezduiin would have gone very differently, I think.nnGood luck in your travels.",""
"55049764-1-5165","You are very kind to help, though you do not seem to know Valeguard's importance. Perhaps <<1>> can explain things for you?",""
"55049764-1-5166","The souls must be releasedone way or another.",""
"55049764-1-5167","This one never should have come here. Jiluza misses the sands of Dune.",""
"55049764-1-5168","To think I was excited about coming here. I want to impress Telenger. But I'm not sure my soul is a price I'm willing to pay.",""
"55049764-1-5169","Ezduiin holds no more fascination for me. I wish to be rid of these ruins.",""
"55049764-1-5170","Every stone here unnerves me. I keep expecting a spirit to peer around each corner.",""
"55049764-1-5171","Leave me alone!",""
"55049764-1-5172","Time's slipping away, friend. If you want to beat my record you need to get out there with that bow.nnTalking to me isn't going to help you catch rabbits.",""
"55049764-1-5173","Sure, you could use normal, non-magical, absolutely regular arrows.nnOr you could use exciting arrows. Fiery arrows. Arrows that get to go boom!",""
"55049764-1-5174","Please … we need to stop the Maormer ….",""
"55049764-1-5175","This invasion is over! Without the ability to signal their ships, the Maormer won't be able to navigate the shallows. They'll turn around or find themselves swimming back to Pyandonea.nnAll of Auridon is in your debt. Well done!",""
"55049764-1-5176","Well, you made short work of that little task. My vengeance is complete.nnI thank you, and I owe you a debt. Perhaps we'll see each other again sometime.",""
"55049764-1-5177","You can do it! Beat that lizard at his own game!",""
"55049764-1-5178","You do me a great honor. I miss my three daughters terribly. I'm not whole without them.nnBut you give me hope.",""
"55049764-1-5180","Pleased to meet you, I'm sure. These damnable Maormer are not the most charitable of hosts.",""
"55049764-1-5181","Didn't expect to see a friendly face. Get me out of here.",""
"55049764-1-5182","Maormer scum. They took us by surprise. Did the Captain send you?",""
"55049764-1-5183","Please find my friends' bodies and burn them before they rise as vampires!",""
"55049764-1-5184","You risked everything to help me. I won't forget it.",""
"55049764-1-5185","Incredible! Did you see that? Unfortunate that the crystal lattice was destroyed in the process, but it served its purpose well.",""
"55049764-1-5187","Don't suppose you're bringing any reinforcements, are you?",""
"55049764-1-5188","Did you see her? She tried to kill me! nnColonwe is an ancestral spirit that haunts this grove. She's always been a mischievous one, but I've never seen her so violent!",""
"55049764-1-5189","Thanks to you and <<1>>, these people will be able to find their eternal rest.",""
"55049764-1-5191","My sisters and I are ready to aid you.",""
"55049764-1-5193","Hmm. You look familiar. Have we met before?",""
"55049764-1-5194","My Sister of Waves lingers just ahead. Go. Find her.",""
"55049764-1-5195","We will make ready to face the lamia queen, and meet you when our spells are ready.",""
"55049764-1-5196","Destroy that thing before it kills the captain!",""
"55049764-1-5197","I've never felt such pain! Ugh, the Maormer are little better than animals!",""
"55049764-1-5198","The Worm Cult might've summoned Mauloch without your intervention. We're all grateful for what you did to stop them.",""
"55049764-1-5199","The Worm Cult sought the Blood of Mauloch? Praise Y'ffre you were here to stop them!",""
"55049764-1-5200","Be strong. The fate of our ancestors' eternal souls rests in your hands now.",""
"55049764-1-5201","<Golun was stabbed repeatedly until he died.>",""
"55049764-1-5205","<<1>> brought the shard you retrieved into the ruins for the final battle.nnWith only one shard, you have little chance of defeating Sinmur by yourself.",""
"55049764-1-5206","Despite our losses, we can still turn the tide here!",""
"55049764-1-5207","With you at our side, we'll take back the Hall or die trying!",""
"55049764-1-5208","Please watch over Ande. Don't let anything happen to her!",""
"55049764-1-5209","Any luck?",""
"55049764-1-5210","Andewen got us out of there. She has the scales of Auri-El!",""
"55049764-1-5211","Good luck in there.",""
"55049764-1-5212","I wasn't here long enough to know <<1>>. Her reputation brought me here.",""
"55049764-1-5213","These Worms should never have crawled up from below.",""
"55049764-1-5215","Sir! Glad I found you. The Silvenar told us to keep eyes out for you.nnWe're kind of in the frying pan here.",""
"55049764-1-5217","Do not stay your hand. The curse ends with my death as easily as any other way.nnKill me.",""
"55049764-1-5219","I knew something was up with these guards. An actual member of the First Auridon Marines has shown up. He wanted to speak with you.",""
"55049764-1-5221","Get going, Arrow. If Ash has asked your aid, you've no time to waste chatting with me.",""
"55049764-1-5222","Excellent work! They had it coming.",""
"55049764-1-5224","The camp's not far from here. I doubt the cultists will simply let you take one.nnThey never dared enter Treehenge before. I wonder what changed?",""
"55049764-1-5225","Some of the villagers may be inside their homes, but most are in the market square. Vadda'ra hopes you can live with yourself for doing this.",""
"55049764-1-5226","A necromancer leads the cultists, sacrificing them to reach my tomb. Each death strengthens the spell he's ready to cast.",""
"55049764-1-5227","I really don't know much about how to get inside Silvenar. I only arrived here with the Silvenar a few hours ago.nnHmm … that whole naming thing could get a bit confusing, couldn't it?",""
"55049764-1-5228","Oh, still around? You're a dedicated merchant!",""
"55049764-1-5230","A lighthouse is just a tower of stone. Towers can be rebuilt.",""
"55049764-1-5231","Bloody parchment in your hands. Does that mean …?",""
"55049764-1-5232","Can I help you?",""
"55049764-1-5233","You're a gentle sort. Thank you. I'll see Yiri's taken care of.nnYou deal with those Worm Cult bastards.",""
"55049764-1-5234","I know our sound isn't ""together"" yet, but it will be! See you in Silvenar!",""
"55049764-1-5235","Now you'll all see? My new friend here is going to finish you off!",""
"55049764-1-5236","Those drums are the best I've ever had. Now that you've found us, please find them!",""
"55049764-1-5237","We can't perform without instruments! Please find them!",""
"55049764-1-5238","Music brings people together on many different levels, doesn't it?",""
"55049764-1-5239","Well, well. Seems you're the one I should've concerned myself with all along.nnI've got my orders, no thanks to those Khajiit. They'll get their just reward soon enough.",""
"55049764-1-5240","We knocked the giants from their perches!",""
"55049764-1-5241","You see? There were too many. Look what they've done  what they're capable of doing! Monstrous!",""
"55049764-1-5242","She's made it to the crypts? Hmm. Well, at least now she's surrounded by family.",""
"55049764-1-5243","Her Majesty can handle herself, but she can also be reckless. Don't leave her side!",""
"55049764-1-5244","When we spoke last, I said your tale would be forever remembered. It seems our memories must grow longer if we are to keep up with your exploits.",""
"55049764-1-5245","Don't let death and destruction discourage you, friend. For the right coin, this one can make your day.",""
"55049764-1-5247","Fool! Take the shard. It will never profit you.",""
"55049764-1-5248","Can't believe they won't let an old man drink in peace.",""
"55049764-1-5250","This Amulet is incredibly important. We will protect it until we are ready to use it.",""
"55049764-1-5253","You're working with Tovisa? I hope you have a plan.",""
"55049764-1-5254","I just want to go home. Get some rest. Read a book.",""
"55049764-1-5255","Have you located my commander?",""
"55049764-1-5256","This time we should burn that giant to ashes. And then scatter the ashes to the winds.nnHave you spoken with Vigrod yet?",""
"55049764-1-5257","I hope that's the last we ever see of Sinmur. Vigrod's been looking all over for you.",""
"55049764-1-5258","Telenger is amazing, isn't he? I'd do anything to get his recommendation.",""
"55049764-1-5259","Honor and praise to you. It's always been my dream to work with Telenger. He's quite brilliant. And handsome!nnSuch a shame Ezduiin has been such a disappointment.",""
"55049764-1-5260","Telenger's recommendation is a powerful force within the guild. I only hope one day I can earn it.",""
"55049764-1-5261","I'd heard being Telenger's assistant was dangerous. But this!",""
"55049764-1-5262","Everyone here only cares about impressing Telenger. It's all Ejukki hears day in and day out.",""
"55049764-1-5263","I hope someday Telenger will look upon me as he does Andewen. I want to prove myself.nnI just don't want to end up like Uricantar.",""
"55049764-1-5264","May your step be silent and fall in shadow, friend.",""
"55049764-1-5265","There you are. Vigrod wants to talk to you, right away.",""
"55049764-1-5266","Are you insane? Can't you see the town is under attack?",""
"55049764-1-5268","You did it! The whole line speaks of your service. The bodies we've got out here will make sure the Daedra stay bottled up in Firsthold.nnThank you.",""
"55049764-1-5269","We've got a dozen more strong bodies on the line, traveler! Thank you for bringing word of our troubles to Skywatch.",""
"55049764-1-5270","Ah, at last. Queen Ayrenn is eager to speak with you.",""
"55049764-1-5271","Do you think I should change my hair color? I'm thinking of something in a pink or green.",""
"55049764-1-5272","My agents tell me that three new souls have joined the celebration.",""
"55049764-1-5273","Enough! I'm no match for an Ebonheart brute.",""
"55049764-1-5275","Fine. You win. Give me the goblet.",""
"55049764-1-5277","No more! I'll drink it.",""
"55049764-1-5278","My men and I will try to keep the locals out of the area. There are few things more dangerous than ancestral spirits on a rampage.",""
"55049764-1-5279","Word of advice, friend. Never trust a necromancer.nnIf you absolutely have to, think hard, and then walk the other way.",""
"55049764-1-5280","You got here just in time.nnBut I know you didn't come in with the investigation team. Who are you?",""
"55049764-1-5281","You shouldn't have a hard time looking for a fight around here. nnLuck.",""
"55049764-1-5284","I'm still dead, aren't I? I hoped it was just a bad dream. I sense I still have one more role to play, though.",""
"55049764-1-5285","This audience needs to drink more.",""
"55049764-1-5286","I'm bored. There's too much chatter and not enough rhythm.",""
"55049764-1-5287","I love a good crowd, but there needs to be music!",""
"55049764-1-5288","I'll never be able to face Bar-Neeus again, curse him. His generosity has saved us and we'll rebuild. Only when I can repay him will my shame be lessened. Damn him, and you!",""
"55049764-1-5290","If anyone can retrieve No-Name's precious package, it's you!nnWonderful, courageous, admirable you!",""
"55049764-1-5292","Damned undead. If there's anything I can't stand it's a Stars-damned vampire.",""
"55049764-1-5293","Ah, you're back. Good. Sorry, just trying to stay on my feet.",""
"55049764-1-5294","Need to see this woman. No time to talk.",""
"55049764-1-5295","You did it! Congratulations!",""
"55049764-1-5297","Ah, it is a sun-blessed day, no? Is there something I can interest you in?",""
"55049764-1-5298","How goes the search? Still searching, yes? Hmm.",""
"55049764-1-5300","Thought I might make it to Vulkhel Guard, but I just couldn't go any farther.",""
"55049764-1-5301","<<1>> is free! You're so kind to help me.",""
"55049764-1-5302","Will the killers come back? Are we safe here? I can't stop shaking, I'm so afraid!",""
"55049764-1-5303","You've returned! And the bards, stupid though they may be, are alive!",""
"55049764-1-5305","Poor Queen. Razum-dar can't imagine her sitting out the fight willingly. Her retinue must have held her down to keep her from entering the fray.",""
"55049764-1-5307","You've done it! The rest of the lady's entourage has gone on ahead. Did you deal with the mad man?",""
"55049764-1-5308","My friends are in cages in the Worm Cult camp. Will you rescue them? One of the cultists must have the key!",""
"55049764-1-5309","Once again, you've pulled my arse out of the fire. I owe you a round, maybe two, next time you're in Riften.",""
"55049764-1-5310","Dark rumors in town. Too many dark rumors.",""
"55049764-1-5311","Have you heard the rumors of cultists about? Dark times, indeed.",""
"55049764-1-5313","Good luck in your travels, my friend. I'm sure the Nords of Skyrim are grateful for your presence. Just as grateful as I am.",""
"55049764-1-5314","You're lucky you're not a Daedra. I may be an innkeeper, but that doesn't mean I can't adequately protect myself!",""

"55049764-1-5316","Full Moon. This one had errands to run today. Jiyya was lucky enough to be outside the city when High Kinlady Estre arrived.",""
"55049764-1-5317","This might be Iduthal's last mug of amber ale … if the Daedra haven't destroyed this one's supply. nnTuinvitar said there's no way he'd let the Dremora get to it. The fool.",""
"55049764-1-5318","Thank you. Thank you so much. I can think again.",""

"55049764-1-5321","There's no hope for it! The city's lost. Might as well start looking to move to Skywatch.",""
"55049764-1-5322","They killed my husband! Those bastards ….",""
"55049764-1-5323","What are you doing! The Prophet's opened the way, get going!",""

"55049764-1-5401","<<1>> warned me about the danger this place posed with all of the Maormer about. Poor lass! She deserves better.nnIf you deal with those Broken Coast bastards, I'll see she gets it.",""

"55049764-1-5410","I comend you for your valor.",""
"55049764-1-5411","Get away from me, cat. I don't know what sort of disease lives in your fur, and I don't want to find out.",""
"55049764-1-5412","I need to make medicine for Barothlas. Explore the valley and find out what's going on there. Maybe someone below knows where the city went.",""
"55049764-1-5413","Oh, it's you again. Did you show good Jorald here that ring you found? I'm sure he would be pleased to know you gave the bandits what they deserved.",""
"55049764-1-5414","These people are lunatics. As soon as Barothlas can walk, Jarakh will return to Velyn Harbor.nnThere is no profit to be had here. Perhaps next year.",""
"55049764-1-5415","No telling what'll happen if the cultists complete their ritual. Please help us stop it!",""

"55049764-1-5417","Nice! That'll show 'em!",""

"55049764-1-5420","We have to stop the ritual!",""

"55049764-1-5422","We didn't wait long enough after sealing the tears outside. Or maybe there are two Daedroth! Let's wait for the second to come forth, and then the city is sure to follow.",""
"55049764-1-5423","Do what you can. Heldil needs your help.",""

"55049764-1-5435","<You would almost swear this statue could move.>",""
"55049764-1-5438","The Sentinels are connected. If we destroy one, the others will also be blinded for a time.",""
"55049764-1-5439","Estrethe High Kinlady herself? I can't believe it, though I've seen it now with my own eyes.",""
"55049764-1-5440","Grab a mug and get to drinking!",""
"55049764-1-5441","Let me guess, that handiwork on those houses was your doing?",""
"55049764-1-5442","Ah, peace at last. Or as peaceful as the Rift can be nowadays. I feared the giants would never leave us alone.",""
"55049764-1-5443","I'm very worried about my cooks. I hope you can find whatever's causing the trouble!",""
"55049764-1-5444","I have to admit, I'm impressed. Cool like the scales of Auri-El, you are.nnGood luck with the captain.",""

"55049764-1-5446","Explain yourself. What are you doing here?",""
"55049764-1-5447","This town is rotten, down to the roots. Like a Full Moon, the Eyes of the Queen stare down.",""
"55049764-1-5448","Make your way to Tanzelwil at your own pace. Seek out my entourage when you arrive. They'll be able to direct you to me.nnAnd good luck, to us both, on the road.",""

"55049764-1-5454","Raz needs to report our success here. Her Majesty will be pleased.",""
"55049764-1-5455","You should continue to listen to the story of our village. <<1>> has more to tell.",""
"55049764-1-5463","Do you know what happened to my husband Urynnar? Has he been cured?",""
"55049764-1-5464","Thanks again for hunting down my crew. Ungrateful louts.",""
"55049764-1-5465","A Maormer infestation of Auridon could be very, very bad. Anala hates to think of how bad this could be.",""
"55049764-1-5466","Oof. Damn that wine.",""
"55049764-1-5472","Do you have something to say?",""
"55049764-1-5473","You are a bag of miracles, my friend. We are fortunate the Cult did not enthrall you, though perhaps your will would have overcome them anyway.nnAs for the Obsidian HuskI destroyed it while you did battle with Theran.",""
"55049764-1-5474","I warned her. I told her I'd never been on a ship before. I think she was fine with my work.nnUntil I threw up on her boots.",""
"55049764-1-5475","I hope all is well. What brings you to back to Fallowstone?",""
"55049764-1-5476","Ivarstead is quite a trek. But if you want the coin, start walking. Ha!",""
"55049764-1-5477","Well, I have to say, I'm rather shocked you actually completed the contract with all your bumbling. Well, congradualtions, you made it through without getting caught, that should earn you a sweet roll.",""
"55049764-1-5478","This one imagines you may have some questions. What can Raz tell you?",""
"55049764-1-5479","Please head to the ritual site. No telling what they're up to!",""
"55049764-1-5480","Have you talked to <<1>>? She's been looking for you.",""
"55049764-1-5481","<Its empty>",""
"55049764-1-5482","The finest weapons in all the Dominion. Forged right here in Mathiisen. nnHot off the anvil. If you will.",""

"55049764-1-5486","So. How'd it go?",""
"55049764-1-5491","I've always hated spiders, but I think today proved that squashing them can be extremely gratifying.nnAt any rate, you've been a great help. Two-Blades will probably want to thank you, too.",""
"55049764-1-5492","It's up to you and me, friend!",""
"55049764-1-5493","You turned a crushing defeat into resounding victory, my friend. The Fighters Guild lost many today, but thanks to you, it was not for nothing.nnSpeak with Two-Blades when you are able.",""
"55049764-1-5494","Do … do you have them?",""
"55049764-1-5497","I've begun to hear rumors. They say there weren't many survivors. They say my … my father was killed.nnHe should have taken this more seriously. I … I can't believe he's gone.",""
"55049764-1-5499","From your look, I think you climbed the stairs to the Throat of the World. Did you find the herb?",""
"55049764-1-5501","I've heard things have calmed down a bit around here.",""
"55049764-1-5502","I can't believe you killed the giant. Really? Wow, uh, that's great.",""
"55049764-1-5503","Nice to see a new face in town. Be careful though. Lots of travelers have been disappearing lately.",""
"55049764-1-5506","I've been watching you, and you've been talking to just about everyone in therel. What have you learned?",""
"55049764-1-5507","Welcome to the Withered Tree. Good luck getting any actual help around here.",""
"55049764-1-5508","Thanks for the daggers, they'll fetch a nice price. I'll be in touch when I have another job for you.",""
"55049764-1-5509","Took your time, didn't you? Did you get the daggers?",""
"55049764-1-5510","Ow. Damn those Veiled Heritance!",""
"55049764-1-5511","Thank the Divines, I am not a dead man.",""
"55049764-1-5512","Don't you have someplace to be?",""
"55049764-1-5513","I can't stop worrying.",""
"55049764-1-5515","Those bugs are in the hay. All over the place. Go get them!",""
"55049764-1-5516","I'm not taking any more guild money. They want to kill one of their own, they can do it themselves.",""
"55049764-1-5517","Managed to bag my Ranger! And Cariel here has been telling me about your exploits.",""
"55049764-1-5518","If you're going to hang around, pull up a chair and buy us a round.",""
"55049764-1-5519","Defeat Ulfnir, then search him. We must get that crown!",""
"55049764-1-5522","My friends! I'm so pleased zombies didn't eat your faces!",""
"55049764-1-5523","Seems like Ankur might not have messed up this time. You just might work out.",""
"55049764-1-5524","I'm glad to see that business at Skuldafn's dealt with, but a soldier's duty is never done. The Rift needs your help.",""
"55049764-1-5526","Rescue, at last!",""
"55049764-1-5527","Ah, you've found my drunken Nords. I'll take them off your hands. Lead them back out.",""
"55049764-1-5528","<Malsia must have set Solvar aflame when he attacked her.>",""
"55049764-1-5529","The fish have stopped biting for some reason.",""
"55049764-1-5530","Thanks for the help. When the brew's done, I'll let you lick the foam off the ichor!",""

"55049764-1-5532","I'm sorry, I was just speaking with the High Kinlady. And now you've interrupted us. Excuse us, please?",""
"55049764-1-5533","Enjoying the city, I hope? Apologies if the others are a bit distracted. Everyone's on edge today.",""
"55049764-1-5534","This one hopes your new souvenir comes in handy.",""
"55049764-1-5535","So you're back! If this means you have what Mom wants, then I'd talk to her right away.",""
"55049764-1-5536","Hrmph. Feels like the dead have settled down some. I'm sure that won't last.",""
"55049764-1-5537","Please, lead me out of here.",""
"55049764-1-5538","Palith will come to forgive me in time. I may not ever forgive Eranamo.",""
"55049764-1-5539","Thank you. Thank you for sparing my brother's life.",""
"55049764-1-5540","I never want to see this place again.",""
"55049764-1-5542","I shouldn't have left the village, but I had to know if my daughter's alive.nnNow I don't know if I'll live long enough to see her again.",""
"55049764-1-5543","Thank the moons, we're not too late. I hope she still has enough strength to drink.",""
"55049764-1-5545","I know it's not much. But we wanted you to have this sack of supplies. Thank you!",""
"55049764-1-5546","Good luck. If you need us, the Marines have your back.",""

"55049764-1-5548","That vile witch. I never liked her.",""

"55049764-1-5553","So. Did you finish your tour of our little school?",""
"55049764-1-5554","Remember, it's fine if the Redguard see you burning the boats; we want them to attack the Wood Orcs.nnOf course, that does mean you'll have to fight your way free of them, so be careful.",""
"55049764-1-5556","Nothing but trouble since them Redguards got here. Trouble! Stealing, conniving, ugly brutes.nnI hope you gave them what for!",""
"55049764-1-5557","You're a lucky recruit. The Veiled Queen herself will be making a speech in support of the cause. You'll be able to see her firsthand!nnAssuming you survive the trials.",""

"55049764-1-5565","I'll see you dead for this!",""
"55049764-1-5566","Don't leave me here! They'll kill me!",""
"55049764-1-5567","If only my mother could see me now!",""

"55049764-1-5579","Yummy bread. Enjoy it.",""
"55049764-1-5580","An impressive time. You've passed the Veil's trial of endurance.",""
"55049764-1-5581","Mara's heart, you've done good work here. Little wonder Razum-dar trusts you.",""
"55049764-1-5587","You took the wind out of Helane's sails, for sure. No one's ever crossed her that badly before!",""

"55049764-1-5605","It seems my little cave-in did the trick. Look, the prison is barely guarded.",""
"55049764-1-5606","I left my father to help the Eagle's Brook survivors. I was determined to make sure the Red Rooks wouldn't profit from more murder and mayhem.",""

"55049764-1-5614","There's a temple to Sanguine out in the swamps. You'd have to be strange in the head to go there on purpose.",""

"55049764-1-5660","A great prize you have claimed. I will not be sad to leave this place.",""
"55049764-1-5661","Ready when you are, friend.",""

"55049764-1-5664","It must be here somewhere. Please, keep looking.",""
"55049764-1-5665","Hrmm. Well, belike you're right, when all's said and done. nnNow I'll just have to see what I can do for me new crew, here, with that old shaman's tricks.",""
"55049764-1-5666","I just got back from Narsis. Were you the one who saved the city?",""
"55049764-1-5667","We have no idea how much time has passed. I suspect our small village is long gone. The Hollow City will be our new home.",""
"55049764-1-5678","With Meridia's Lights, we can turn the tide of this campaign. Kireth said you came from the Hollow City. We shall go there once everyone has had a chance to rest.nnThank you for your help. You know, you remind me of one of my students.",""
"55049764-1-5679","Thank the Eight you found him. Thrice-blessed are you, my savior.",""
"55049764-1-5680","We never should have left Cloudrest. My mother was right.",""

"55049764-1-5682","This is unacceptable! And all my husband's fault!",""
"55049764-1-5696","Thank you for getting me out of there. I saw the flames from the road. I could have been trapped in my own home.",""
"55049764-1-5697","I hope you find her.",""
"55049764-1-5698","Please, you must help me! The Daedra tore my spirit free and ravaged my mind. I … I cannot remember the spell to drop the barrier!",""
"55049764-1-5699","I feel … strange. Like I've been asleep for a very long time.",""

"55049764-1-5706","My head feels less foggy. I may try writing a song or two again.",""

"55049764-1-5714","Whatever that rune does, this one wants no part of it.nnMaybe you can figure out how to use it to our advantage. Might even provide an edge against the Observer.",""

"55049764-1-5727","If you manage to kill the champions of both Estre and Thallik, I'm not sure what happens next. No one has ever gotten that far.nnJust stay alive and remain wary. Who knows how the Observer will alter the playing field if you get too close to victory.",""

"55049764-1-5735","You picked Estre to help?nnI … I think that's a good idea. She suggested we throw a party when I showed up. I guess it's a little more getting to work for you.",""
"55049764-1-5736","Remember. When the Observer asks for your decision, choose me!",""
"55049764-1-5739","Start by looking for Marq's special brew. If any is left, the smell might make him slightly less crazy.",""

"55049764-1-5761","I have long dreamed of kind words and a way out, but I think this task is beyond you, my friend.nnThe first phylactery is up ahead, watched by impossible creatures. You cannot defeat them. No one can.",""

"55049764-1-5770","Kill them. Kill the Dremora and stop the summoning!",""
"55049764-1-5771","What is your decision?",""
"55049764-1-5772","<<1>>! And she's unhurt! The Hist guided you, as I knew it would.nnBut did it also guide you to my ruby? Please, tell me!",""
"55049764-1-5773","You're lying! My father never would have done this.",""
"55049764-1-5774","I … I thank you. I didn't … I wasn't expecting you would be so capable. You've ended Anconath's torture, and freed a fragment of my soul.nnAre you willing to do more? My soul remains bound, and the Daedra are torturing others.",""
"55049764-1-5775","If you're lucky, you won't die before the amulet starts working, if it ever does.",""
"55049764-1-5776","Is the amulet charged? Did it work?",""
"55049764-1-5777","Well done. Very well done!",""
"55049764-1-5778","A powerful lich guards the last fragment, plucked out of history and summoned by my husband. He's ravaging the soul of one of my students.nnI would die again to help that studentbut I can't. Please, save him if you can.",""
"55049764-1-5779","I wish Nelhilda would forgive me, but I understand her anger. She has her soul back and her place in Sovngarde is assured. I can hold onto that, and I'll make sure that anyone else who comes here receives whatever aid I can provide.",""
"55049764-1-5780","I never hoped that I would ever be free, but I thank you for unbinding this fragment of my soul.nnYou've helped Faindor, too, and that brings me a sense of peace that I am unable to express.",""
"55049764-1-5781","You have freed not only my soul, but the souls of all the students caught in my husband's attack.nnYour actions right a wrong that was long overdue.",""
"55049764-1-5784","Don't worry, the Serpent is dormant for now.",""
"55049764-1-5785","<<1>> is under pirate attack! Worse, they climbed in through our portholes and breached the hull.nnI'll use their blood to swab the decks. Think they'll put more holes in my hull, do they? We had just finished repairs on the last ones!",""
"55049764-1-5786","Greetings, my friend. You did it. The undead fell in their tracks.nnThe pirates, they surrendered or fled. A good day.",""
"55049764-1-5787","At least we know what's going on at the lighthouse now.nnIt may take a while, but we'll send men down there as soon as we can spare them.",""
"55049764-1-5790","I suppose <<1>>'s death was just, but so many of my people were sickened because of what? An old feud between brothers? This is why you'll never see an Orc wear the Amulet of Kings.nnBut the bandits stopped their attacks, so you have my thanks.",""
"55049764-1-5791","Ha! I knew you'd done it the moment those undead fell to tatters!nnHalf of the pirates surrendered on the spot. They must've thought whatever you did to the undead would happen to them next!",""
"55049764-1-5792","Look, see? That abandoned boat is my only chance!nnPlease, give me my things. I need to get away from here!",""
"55049764-1-5793","I suppose you fancy yourself a hero.",""
"55049764-1-5794","The Amulet awaits. Take it so we can escape this place.",""
"55049764-1-5795","What have you learned? Whose tales are false?",""
"55049764-1-5796","You decided to help those … those … monsters? Instead of my people?nnI'm so mad I can't even talk to you right now!",""
"55049764-1-5797","This place … it does strange things to your mind.",""
"55049764-1-5798","Ozor, Salach, and Lidenar are free and Captain Angarthal is dead. I believe this day is getting better.nnI may have lost my ship, but you've restored my hope.",""
"55049764-1-5799","I told you I could get out on my own. Thank you for rescuing my employees. Can you make certain <<1>> knows?nnI think she was headed back toward Haven.",""
"55049764-1-5800","My contact is no wilting flower. You'll find him on the beach, I'm certain of it.nnLook, collect the payment yourself for all your trouble. As long as he doesn't leave without the mixture, we'll still have our side business. That's fair, yes?",""
"55049764-1-5801","Let's get out of here before my axe breaks.",""

"55049764-1-5805","Greetings, Orc.",""
"55049764-1-5806","Well, I'd best get back to the Prowler. I expect the <<1>> will want all hands on deck.nnNeedn't bother her with this business, right? Right, right.",""
"55049764-1-5807","You can pass the ""receive a quest"" case now, if you haven't already.  Did you check your Quest Journal, map pins, and Tracker?",""
"55049764-1-5808","What do you say, outlander? Do you still stand with <<1>> Stronghold?",""
"55049764-1-5809","There are … more of you. Were you successful? You found allies?",""
"55049764-1-5817","You wouldn't know anything about proto-Ayleid literature, would you? I can't be certain if the references in these books are metaphors, or descriptions of actual events.nnNo matter, I'll work it out.",""
"55049764-1-5818","Go and find the stolen weapons. Return them to me and prove you're worth the Steel Mask's time.",""

"55049764-1-5822","Oh! You're back. So you weren't eaten by lions, then. Good!nnDid you have any luck with the journals?",""
"55049764-1-5823","Good luck with your froggy! Isn't frog racing the best?",""

"55049764-1-5825","You're lucky Bloodthirster is not competing. Your pathetic beast would not survive!",""
"55049764-1-5826","Did you find everything?",""
"55049764-1-5827","Did you do as you promised? Do my children know peace?",""
"55049764-1-5829","Your Dunmer blood proved true. Vox is defeated, order is restored. Well done.",""
"55049764-1-5830","So, how did it go?",""
"55049764-1-5832","You can pass the ""receive a quest"" case now, if you haven't already.  Did you check your Quest Journal, map pins, and Tracker?",""
"55049764-1-5835","What do you want? I've got to repair these things while I can.",""
"55049764-1-5836","This is not the time to talk. There are trolls in here!",""
"55049764-1-5837","The stronghold survived because of your help. We won't forget this.",""
"55049764-1-5838","Rumor has it you have the Red Rooks on the run. I'll sleep easier when the bandits have left town.",""
"55049764-1-5839","<<1>> won't be back. Knows if he shows his face in Stormhold, he'll get it smacked. Price of starting false rumors, right?",""
"55049764-1-5840","You know, this wine isn't half bad. And this cellar is nice and quiet. Cozy. Comfortable, even.nnI think I'm going to live down here forever.",""

"55049764-1-5842","Those Red Rooks may be gone, but I still don't think I want to do any work.",""
"55049764-1-5844","So many fleshlings running through the halls. Such obstreperous creatures!nnYou seem a fine specimen. I don't think I have one of your kind in my garden.",""

"55049764-1-5846","Acquiring a Daedra's eyeball is a disgusting request, but it will release the binding, I'm certain of it.nnAnd if it doesn't, there should be some clean rags at our camp.",""

"55049764-1-5849","Brute-vitar sealed us out. <<1>>'s fellows all dead, killed by dirty snake-ladies. No doubt this Pact-soldier kills poor <<1>> now.nnThis swamp, I hate it. Endless woe! Poor <<1>>!",""

"55049764-1-5860","These ritual altars remain foreign to me. Dracien believes the Canonreeve is preparing a Worm Cult rite. Some sort of necromancy.nnIf this is true, Tamriel is in great danger. One Canonreeve with loyalties to the Worm Cult could mean others.",""
"55049764-1-5861","Look at this hovel. It's like the cavern itself is rotting. And the smell! I can taste it with every breath.nnThe Canonreeve must be dabbling in necromancy. She may even be Worm Cult. That would be fantastic.",""

"55049764-1-5882","We'll make sure the Red Rooks know they aren't welcome in Crosswych. I think a dagger in the ribs sends that message loud and clear!",""
"55049764-1-5883","I think Tamien Sellan has the right idea. We need to fight back and show these Red Rooks that they can't just march in and take over our town.",""

"55049764-1-5892","It may not be much, but <<1>> scraped together a reward. We can't exactly pay you in catapults. Not if we want the Dominion to take us in.nnWhat you did for us … we won't forget it.",""

"55049764-1-5924","I was so happy to see Sir Hughes escape from whatever darkness held him in thrall, but it seems now, his fate is more unclear than ever. nnWhatever he may have done, I would counsel the duke to show mercy. Always mercy.",""
"55049764-1-5925","Just seeing my father's old sword fills me with courage! I can do this, I think!",""

"55049764-1-5953","That was quick. Don't tell me something went wrong.",""
"55049764-1-5957","Just clear the way for my messenger in case someone sends reinforcements … or attacks the Dominion elsewhere.nnWe'll take back Velyn Harbor, one district at a time.",""
"55049764-1-5958","Hear me out. I've no wish to battle you today.",""
"55049764-1-5959","You not allowed in. Go 'way.",""
"55049764-1-5960","Khajiit has been waiting. You have the weapons?",""
"55049764-1-5961","The Sea Drakes will fall apart without Helane. They'll be at each other's throats in a day.",""
"55049764-1-5967","I've said everything I'm going to say about the attack on Velyn Harbor. I'm certain my superiors will see the wisdom in my actions.",""
"55049764-1-5968","Good to see you again. Redguard invaders in Velyn Harbor doesn't surprise me. But the Drublog clan? They side with the Bosmer in times of war.nnWe need to find out what's changed.",""
"55049764-1-5970","Speak to my father. He made the trap for <<c:1>>, so he can break it.nnHe's at home in the lower arena. I hope he speaks to you.",""
"55049764-1-5971","Off with you. I am too busy to entertain visitors.",""
"55049764-1-5972","Well, well, well. See that? That's an impressive trap door for a simple farmhouse cellar. nnI love it when my hunches pan out!",""
"55049764-1-5973","Quit staring at me. Leave me be or kill me, just get it over with!",""
"55049764-1-5974","Key's probably on him. Go ahead and grab it.nnUgh, he smells like rotten grapes. I'm going to get cleaned up. I'll meet you at the farm.",""
"55049764-1-5975","If you can help <<c:1>> again, we'd all be in your debt.",""
"55049764-1-5978","That was a good fight.",""
"55049764-1-5979","Perhaps we shall fight soon.",""
"55049764-1-5980","You need to fight the rest before you fight the best. Me, being the best.",""
"55049764-1-5981","Beat the brawlers and then I'll see what you're made of.",""
"55049764-1-5982","I've done all I can, but the king seems to slip further away every hour. nnI'm afraid there is no way to enter the dream either. There's something different this timesomething far more dangerous.",""
"55049764-1-5983","Prove yourself against some brawlers. Perhaps then we can test each other.",""
"55049764-1-5984","I hope you've been busy, friend. My heist is all planned and I'm itching to go.",""
"55049764-1-5985","After you've kicked around the pups, come back here. I'll bite your head off.",""
"55049764-1-5986","What brings you to this trashpit?",""
"55049764-1-5987","That cat is going to get an earful when I find him.",""
"55049764-1-5988","Business should pick up as soon as the Mabrigash get used to our presence.",""
"55049764-1-5989","Who are you? What're you doing here?",""
"55049764-1-5990","Go muck around with the chumps.",""
"55049764-1-5991","Please hurry. Preserving this collection has been my life's work.",""
"55049764-1-5992","Another torturer from Helane, even uglier than the last one.",""
"55049764-1-5993","I pledge my life to helping King Emeric … and to destroying anything, anyone, associated with Vaermina.",""
"55049764-1-5994","Don't know who you are, but you better run if you don't want the Sea Drakes to gut you.",""
"55049764-1-5995","Are you all done?",""
"55049764-1-5996","This bucket is AWESOME.",""
"55049764-1-5998","Who in Oblivion are you?",""
"55049764-1-6001","Get me out of here and I'll owe you.",""
"55049764-1-6003","Disrupt the rituals, kill the cultists. Drain the energy from their defilements.",""
"55049764-1-6005","I sense great power in the staff. You've done well.",""
"55049764-1-6007","What's in those portals, anyway? Never mind. I don't want to know.",""
"55049764-1-6008","I'm going to wait right here. I've got an unnatural aversion to alits and I'm not afraid to admit it. Just let me know when you've found that hidden door.",""
"55049764-1-6009","Go get 'em! I'll leave uniforms around for you once I get my knives into a few more cultists.",""
"55049764-1-6011","I can't face <<1>> without our goods.",""
"55049764-1-6012","Are you ready to head inside?",""
"55049764-1-6013","Welcome back to Wayrest, my friend. Your presence is reassuring in these troubles times.nnDo you have news regarding the Dream Shard?",""
"55049764-1-6014","I recognize you from the stories. You're the one who helped save Count At-Tura, aren't you? He's … an old friend.nnI'm glad to make your acquaintance. Don't mind the guillotine. It's just for show.",""
"55049764-1-6015","As soon as I can travel, I'm heading back to the Telvanni coast.",""
"55049764-1-6026","The Drublog will show no mercy. Please, get into the Mages Guild and the Trade Hall quickly.nnIf the townsfolk are still alive, you'll find them there.",""
"55049764-1-6028","Why are you still here?",""
"55049764-1-6029","Home at last. I can't thank you enough for saving us!",""
"55049764-1-6030","Oh, it's you. Did you expect me to gush with praise, hmm?nnToo bad. I should've stayed in the tree stump ….",""
"55049764-1-6031","Feluz has been a little grumpy without his moon-sugar candy, but it's for the best.nnAs soon as there's space in the town square, we'll open a shop. Again, thank you.",""
"55049764-1-6032","Rama, dead. I can't believe it. I'm going to miss the old scoundrel.",""
"55049764-1-6033","Leave me alone. I have to earn my keep around here just like any other person. Malanie doesn't pay me meager wages to lolligag.",""
"55049764-1-6036","This was my first real trial of a full strength potion. I gathered a small horde of thunderbugs, but the elemental energy was too much. The ensuing explosion threw me into the river. nnAs you can see, my contingency plan was successful.",""
"55049764-1-6039","Get in there and show them what you're made of.",""
"55049764-1-6041","One less Ayleid Relic to plague our world. Good!",""
"55049764-1-6042","Now for the heist I mentioned earlier ….",""
"55049764-1-6043","Can't wait to get this heist over and be off this rock.",""
"55049764-1-6044","Do be careful where you store that rod. The trigger is sensitive. Were it to discharge prematurely, the results could be dramatic.",""
"55049764-1-6045","Traitor! Out of my sight! How could you keep that thing?",""
"55049764-1-6046","How wonderful. A tourist.",""
"55049764-1-6047","Don't worry about changing in front of me. I won't peek.",""
"55049764-1-6048","Onsi's bones, what is it now?",""
"55049764-1-6049","Oh, I could lounge out here forever. So nice.",""
"55049764-1-6050","You're in my light.",""
"55049764-1-6051","You return with treasures and a ghost. You have been busy.",""
"55049764-1-6052","You'll find the graveyard near the Daggerfall cathedral. I shall meet you there.nnAnd know this. My master believes you will make the right decision. That's the only reason we're helping you. If you make the wrong decision, it shall cost you dearly.",""
"55049764-1-6053","Ah, my lowly servant! You're just in time.",""
"55049764-1-6054","Like a rat. On fire.",""
"55049764-1-6057","My friend! Welcome back. Do you have some good news?",""
"55049764-1-6058","I can't catch them! They're too big for me!",""
"55049764-1-6059","Have you seen Captain Kaleen? She's supposed to deliver some papers and I'm getting very impatient.",""
"55049764-1-6060","The city's defenses are turned against the Silvenar! This shouldn't be possible.",""
"55049764-1-6062","When my crew turned traitor, I never thought I'd see Betnikh again. Feels good.",""
"55049764-1-6063","Who are you? You weren't on the excavation team.",""
"55049764-1-6065","Make sure Kalari knows I'm thinking about her, all right? Warms an old man's heart to know a pretty girl thinks well of him.",""
"55049764-1-6066","Go … go now!",""
"55049764-1-6067","Honestly, I don't think I'll ever get used to the way he pops around. But at least he's back in one piece and not complainingfor now.",""
"55049764-1-6068","Go … go now!",""
"55049764-1-6069","Damned Colovians. They pick the most inconvenient times to get brave.nnSoldier? Report.",""
"55049764-1-6070","I love a good sneak attack. The look in a man's eye when the knife goes in. Ooh! I just got chills.",""
"55049764-1-6071","I'd shake your hand, but it's covered in steaming shalk guts. But by Baan Dar, why not? Put her there!",""
"55049764-1-6072","Now that the Covenant has that artifact, the Aldmeri Dominion won't dare attack!nnYou're a hero. Don't let anyone tell you different. My brothers, and all of the High King's soldiers, owe you their lives.",""
"55049764-1-6074","That poor man. Killed in the street and no one even knows who was responsible?nnI think I might pack my things and go visit my cousin in Alcaire.",""
"55049764-1-6075","The Lyris I knew loved life and all it had to offer. Sober and boring is no life for a hot-blooded warrior woman!",""
"55049764-1-6077","Don't let him influence her. It took her years to overcome her drinking problem. If she starts again, she may never stop!",""
"55049764-1-6078","You were right to destroy that cursed relic. I honor Kaleen, but she has lost her way.nnNo one should have that power. Certainly not Fahara'jad.",""
"55049764-1-6079","No. I didn't see the murderer. I'm just one woman. I can't see everything all the time.nnOne more person accuses me of neglecting my duty and they're going to get a gauntlet to the face.",""
"55049764-1-6081","A friendly face! Great day for an invasion, isn't it?",""
"55049764-1-6083","The crew of the Spearhead grows again. I did not think to see it so soon. The sun shines on us.",""
"55049764-1-6084","I'm innocent. The Headman framed me, I swear it!",""
"55049764-1-6093","You return. What did you learn of the Bloodthorn plans?",""
"55049764-1-6094","Enjoy your cut, partner. Don't spend it all in one place. As I, no doubt, will.",""
"55049764-1-6095","I will carry the ring with faith to Rawl'kha. The priests there will know just where to tend to it. Thank you again.",""
"55049764-1-6096","I have nothing to say to you.",""
"55049764-1-6099","Kalari will be all right, you will see. Just needs some time to deal with what has happened.nnGo, speak to Ezzag.",""
"55049764-1-6101","That was a great job, Baan Dar is very pleased with you!",""
"55049764-1-6102","I should've never let <<1>> leave my side!",""
"55049764-1-6104","If you ever get your hands on more of those fantastic Nord garments, I'd be happy to buy them from you.",""
"55049764-1-6105","That Nord book you gave me was very … colorful. I may have to read it again.",""
"55049764-1-6107","I am once again a man worthy of the blood of my ancestors!nnLet's have that shield, then.",""
"55049764-1-6110","Amazing to think he gave his life to destroy that thing. Don't worry about us here. With the vault out of the picture, the Colovians will pull back before long. Good work, soldier.",""
"55049764-1-6111","The sooner you can re-light that tower, the better. People here get nervous whenever it goes out.",""
"55049764-1-6112","I believe Mephala's reaction was proof: the temple is sealed. Well done there, I suppose.",""
"55049764-1-6113","Ahh, traveler. Fivefold venerations upon you. I recognize you from Telenger's description. What brings you to the Falinesti Autumn site?",""
"55049764-1-6114","Welcome to the Falinesti Autumn site, traveler. I'm with the team Telenger has brought. You're just as he described you. What brings you this way?",""
"55049764-1-6115","Welcome to the Falinesti Autumn site. Ghadar is surprised, you are just as Telenger described you. This one is working with the great mage to study the site.",""
"55049764-1-6117","Are you well? That was quite the show.",""
"55049764-1-6118","We'll rebuild the collection. You've done the Society, and by association, all of Tamriel, a great favor.",""
"55049764-1-6119","Less wounded than usual. I'd say we definitely have the ogres on the run now.",""
"55049764-1-6120","Hey, is that the Goblin king's crown? You killed him?",""
"55049764-1-6121","Damn that Angof! One death was not enough for that bastard! Look at the trouble he continues to cause me!",""
"55049764-1-6122","This will be remembered as the fight that turned the tide! nnThe General will have moved up to establish a new base at the tower! You go on up.",""
"55049764-1-6123","Thank you.",""
"55049764-1-6124","It is out of my hands now, my friend. It has been an honor serving with you.",""
"55049764-1-6125","There is tension in the air. Can you smell it? Subtle, poisonous. Exciting.",""
"55049764-1-6126","Go, go. Kalari should not have to deal with her father's legacy alone.",""
"55049764-1-6127","We've got a deal.",""
"55049764-1-6128","The little rat is all yours. I'm going to drink even more heavily now.",""
"55049764-1-6129","<<1>>'s been gone for hours. I don't know what I'll do if … if he doesn't come back.",""
"55049764-1-6130","Without that sap, <<1>> might not see another year. Gods willing, this plant'll be his salvation!",""
"55049764-1-6131","<This Redguard died recently. Something is clutched tightly in his hand.>",""
"55049764-1-6132","You've slaughtered Zurana's men. And now you come looking for her blood, yes? nnPerhaps there is another way.",""
"55049764-1-6133","What are you still doing here?! Go find Bob!",""
"55049764-1-6134","Keep moving. I'm in no mood to chat.",""
"55049764-1-6135","Ah I see you have returned. Did you find anything?",""
"55049764-1-6138","I only hope Shagol hasn't lost my best axe forever. This one cannot seem to keep its edge.",""
"55049764-1-6139","You're back! Found anyone else to help us with this heist?",""
"55049764-1-6140","There's three folks Captain Kaleen wants to help with her heistCrafty Lerisa, Jakarn, and Neramo. She told me about 'em. Who do you want to know about?",""
"55049764-1-6141","Get out of here. We're done.",""
"55049764-1-6142","Off you go. The corn should take just seconds to gather. I'm far too busy thinking to do it myself.",""
"55049764-1-6143","Go on about your business. There's nothing to see here.",""
"55049764-1-6144","Be careful in there! There're things in the shadows.",""
"55049764-1-6146","Another victim of the forest? Or have you been spared its horrors?",""
"55049764-1-6147","I'm thankful that you came along. I would have spent my entire life waiting and wondering what became of my husband.",""
"55049764-1-6148","My cousin never returned from the mines. I'm worried sick.nnHe's a miner at Bearclaw Mine. Are you coming from there? I hope he's all right.",""
"55049764-1-6150","You've betrayed me and the Covenant with your actions. I can't stand to be in your company anymore. You'll leave here without me.",""
"55049764-1-6151","As long we have breath in our lungs, we'll keep the Autumn site healthy and growing.",""
"55049764-1-6152","This one overheard. He is called Razum-dar, and on behalf of Queen Ayrenn, he thanks you.",""
"55049764-1-6153","Keep as quiet as you can.nnSignal me if you see any suspicious corpses. My arrows will make short work of them.",""
"55049764-1-6154","Start in Grimfield. Warchief Tazgol sent a few scouts to harry the Bloodthorn there until we can deal with them. We need to stop them from raising more zombies.",""
"55049764-1-6155","I knew you couldn't be trusted. What do you think King Emeric will do with that cursed artifact? You should have destroyed it.",""
"55049764-1-6156","Without that plant sap <<1>> might as well be dead.",""
"55049764-1-6159","Thank tha gods those Colovians are gone now. They wree disturbing my peave something fierce. And I had an anniversary to celebrate, damnit it!",""
"55049764-1-6160","So the true culprit behind Lakana's murder was indeed Vaermina? I'm glad to know her plot against my brother was ultimately thwarted.nnI'm glad we spared Sir Hughes as well. I understand he's doing penance at Pariah Abbey.",""
"55049764-1-6162","Though this battle is important, Aiden Direnni expects my blade to lead the assault against a key Alessian camp to the north. nnAnd what a glorious battle it will be! I'll be leaving shortly.",""
"55049764-1-6163","I heard a lovely, agonized shriek from Zich. Is it dead?",""
"55049764-1-6164","I can smell the sugar leaf on you. Did you get three leaves?",""
"55049764-1-6165","Yes, yes. Let's get this over with.",""
"55049764-1-6167","At last! <<1>> is defeated! The tortured souls, now avenged! nnLong have I waited for this day!",""
"55049764-1-6171","Ahh, such a lovely warmth against the temple stones. So good to smell pumping blood in these halls again.",""
"55049764-1-6172","What is it, Visanne?",""
"55049764-1-6173","Zal-sa is done. You can tell <<1>> that he has quit. nn<<2>> may be able to deal with all this work. Zal-sa cannot!",""

"55049764-1-6179","Well, what are you waiting for? Put on the disguise and let's get a look at you!",""
"55049764-1-6181","Ah! You are the five-clawed walker who helped at <<1>>, yes?nnYour story will buy <<2>> sugar in every city between here and Dune, so thank you!",""
"55049764-1-6182","Don't mind me. I'm just trying to compose something for the Duke and his lady. I understand she has taste and pays good coin.nnThat's if they stay together long enough for me to perform. There's a lot of tension in that court right now.",""
"55049764-1-6183","How many innocent people have died in those mines? The Red Rooks must pay.",""
"55049764-1-6184","Seems like the campaign against the ogres never ends!nnI heard they're still close to Wayrest.",""
"55049764-1-6185","Have you seen the guillotone in the marketplace? I think they're going to do something about that Dreamer cult.nnI'll be glad when this is all over.",""
"55049764-1-6186","This bodes well. With the beach clear we can take the fight to our enemy.",""
"55049764-1-6187","Enter Warcaller Targoth's memories. Witness my fate.",""
"55049764-1-6191","The storms on this island are not natural, and I fear that they play a part in the Maormer plan to attack Malabal Tor.nnFind their source and silence them.",""
"55049764-1-6192","Everyone's heard what you did at Firebrand Keep. I'll tell you now, it was a mistake letting that man live, after what he did to the Duchess.",""
"55049764-1-6194","If you have come to help, tend to the wounded first. They may turn if left to die.",""
"55049764-1-6197","And so, it begins. The remainder of the story has yet to be written. It is your story, now.",""
"55049764-1-6198","You have saved the Claw from true darkness. It is your sacred charge, now.",""
"55049764-1-6199","Agh … that hurt. Probably should not have done that, but … you have to find him. Fort Grimwatch is in the Northern Woods, high up the Reaper's March. This one thinks … that is where he's gone.",""
"55049764-1-6201","You arrived at an auspicious time in Crosswych. I came here to examine the citizens for signs of lycanthropy and found the town overrun by bandits.",""

"55049764-1-6207","When I get my hands on that useless Shagol, I'll rip his skin off!",""
"55049764-1-6208","I'm going to catch my breath before I head back.nnIt sure feels good to have feeling back in my arms and legs again.",""
"55049764-1-6209","There you are. I worried you met your end in the ruins. The souls of the dead still walk, and yet their torment has lessened. What did you do?",""
"55049764-1-6210","I'm still waiting.",""
"55049764-1-6211","You proved yourself capable in Bthzark. I trust you can handle whatever this ruin holds. I will remain at a safe distance.",""

"55049764-1-6595","Move with purpose, slowpaws. Only the fleet of foot survive.",""
"55049764-1-6596","<<1>> will belong to the sea itself before we hand it over to the Maormer! This entire summit is a waste of time.",""

"55049764-1-6602","Move. Unless you don't mind the spatter.",""
"55049764-1-6604","I wonder if you weren't sent by Y'ffre herself. I hope so. nnWe can't let these Hollow drive us away. We have to hold this ground. We have nowhere else to go.",""
"55049764-1-6606","This one is honored to know you, Grand Champion. Balag looks forward to seeing you fight in future days.",""
"55049764-1-6607","Congratulations. Your performance was positively inspiring. Perhaps you aren't the greenhorn you appear to be.",""
"55049764-1-6608","I've wasted decades studying Ayleid wells, and I know less now than I did when I started. I'm ready to give up.",""
"55049764-1-6609","Y'ffre's knees! I didn't expect to find you in one piece.",""
"55049764-1-6610","You're full of surprises, lovely. And aren't you the strong one?",""
"55049764-1-6611","With armies marching across Cyrodiil, I pray our priory will be left alone. But war seldom spares the innocent.",""

"55049764-1-6615","Our scouts say the Hollow have stopped fighting. Some have crumbled into dust. Others have simply wandered off.nnI trust this means you destroyed the Watchman?",""
"55049764-1-6616","I recognize you from Indaenir's description. He said you'd be coming this way.nnHe had hoped to be here to greet you himself, but he seems to have wandered off again. Regardless, we need your help, if you're willing to offer it.",""
"55049764-1-6618","The bindings … they feel brittle … less powerful ….",""
"55049764-1-6619","Thank you for sending those scribs my way. They mean no harm, they're just skittish from the hurricane.nnWith no scribs to protect, the big ones will settle down. Looks like you saved the whole brood.",""
"55049764-1-6620","I hope Asvorn will help me out of this pit. I can't take this much longer.",""
"55049764-1-6621","When Tertius gets back, he's going to be mad about what they've done to our house. I just hope he finds Donus.",""

"55049764-1-6623","Now what?","Che c'è ora?"
"55049764-1-6624","Praise Y'ffre! The miasma has cleared. Yet I sense this begins a new chapter for the Great Tree.nnThough the creatures gorged themselves upon its roots, this was a passing instinct. They can be taught to strengthen the Great Tree.",""
"55049764-1-6625","Chorrol's been through a lot. But we're tough. We'll keep rebuilding, no matter how many quakes and monsters hit us.",""

"55049764-1-6629","There is little we can do to help our fellow Ash'abah here now, so we should do as my father wished.nnWe should dedicate ourselves to destroying the Withered Hand. They killed my father; I will enjoy the opportunity to even the score.",""
"55049764-1-6630","Go. Find Tzik'nith to the northwest. She shall open the way to the tower for you.nnWe shall remain here for now, guarding the Wood Elves' tree. They shall pay dearly to get it back, and my people shall reap the profits!",""
"55049764-1-6631","You're insane to want to go down there. Go speak to Kargand if you won't change your mind. He's led the rest of the Mages Guild contingent into the Hollow.nnYou'll find nothing here but darkness and creatures born of it.",""
"55049764-1-6632","I know Hannura will like the fish. Cold-water fish are her favorite.",""
"55049764-1-6633","You looking for someone in particular?",""
"55049764-1-6635","You're back! Tell me everything! Did it go well? Were you able to convince them?",""
"55049764-1-6636","We must find the key. One of these muskarse smugglers might have it.",""
"55049764-1-6637","We need to get moving. This one knows his sister is alive.",""
"55049764-1-6638","Don't ever become successfulit's a killer. Gathering herbs and delivering them all over Cyrodiil is going to be the death of me yet.",""
"55049764-1-6640","I felt the magicka shockwave from here. I take it you destroyed the Engine?",""
"55049764-1-6641","Look, the vapor is clearing up! I don't know what you did, but it worked!nnI'll let you tell <<1>> the good news.",""
"55049764-1-6642","My shipmates're gone. Guess they're rebuilding the ship now.",""
"55049764-1-6643","We're on an island, and they have a temple just for water? Khajiiti aren't what I expected.",""
"55049764-1-6644","I've not heard from my foreman for some time. I fear there is trouble at the docks.",""
"55049764-1-6645","I saw smoke rising from the docks. Something is wrong. I feel it.",""
"55049764-1-6646","Did you close the door behind you? Check it again. I heard screaming.",""
"55049764-1-6647","Stay back, wanderer. You are welcome to our camp, but our chief is not entertaining guests.nnLike so many of our warriors, he has been poisoned. Only his daughter may disturb his rest.",""
"55049764-1-6649","I hear you're going to match wits with the Mad God! I don't envy you. nnMight I suggest looking over my wares before you go? You never know what you might need in the Daedric realms.",""
"55049764-1-6650","An undead scourge shambles from beneath the waves and the mighty Redguards drop their swords. It's either folly or cowardice. I can't decide which is worse.",""
"55049764-1-6651","My people's pride is maddening. I wish to protect the city, but I may well be killed if I try. It is bad enough that I dabble with the arcaneto strike our honored dead would be an unforgivable sin. You must save my kinsmen from themselves.",""
"55049764-1-6652","Welcome to the Sentinel Mages Guildhall. nnYou have curious look. Masura-dra is thinking you want to join us. Is this so?",""
"55049764-1-6653","My daughter is … not happy right now. She is as stubborn as her mother was, but … death will not be stayed.nnBe assured though, initiate … after you complete the trial, she will help you fight the Hand if you wish.",""
"55049764-1-6654","My brothers and sisters in the Guildhall do not understand why we keep our swords sheathed in the face of the Ra-Netu. It is difficult. But it is a needful discipline, good for fighters such as we.",""
"55049764-1-6655","It appears that Mara has answered my prayers. nnI find myself in a bit of difficulty and I wonder if I could prevail upon you for a favor. A group of notorious bandits sacked the Bravil Chapel of Mara and made off with some holy relics.",""
"55049764-1-6656","Once again, we find ourselves in the Shadow Wood. As unpleasant as it is, I think I'm beginning to understand this place. nnI think I might know how Naemon's Shade is using it to corrupt the Green.",""
"55049764-1-6657","So you made it through the walking corpse pile? Good work. If you managed that, you may be qualified for membership in the Fighters Guild. You interested?",""
"55049764-1-6658","The Chieftess will learn the price of pacifism. Once she's gone, I will begin uniting the tribes - through force if necessary.nnPerhaps one day we'll be strong enough to slay the Wilderking.",""

"55049764-1-6661","The holding cells are below the Hall of Judgment. The captured mages should be down there. I'll keep the gate clear until you return. nnDon't dawdle, if you please. I'm good, but even I have my limits.",""
"55049764-1-6662","The sun and salt are bad for head injuries. You should get to the encampment in the shadow of those towers.nnAnd don't fall asleep unless <<1>> says so!",""

"55049764-1-6667","It's done. The bastard's dead. Thank you, your help was invaluable.",""
"55049764-1-6668","Get yourself gone, elf-slave. Your Queen has no power here.",""
"55049764-1-6670","Sorry, the lodge is off-limits to anyone not part of the Pact delegation. Don't give me any trouble. I'm not in the mood.",""
"55049764-1-6671","Welcome to <<1>>! Enjoy our delicious fine wines. And don't forget, every day at sun-down we serenade the moonrise.",""
"55049764-1-6672","Well? Did you get me a drink, or are you still useless?",""
"55049764-1-6674","You never cease to amuse me, mortal. I shall continue to watch your progress with great interest.",""
"55049764-1-6675","And now I fade. Where will I go? What realm will I next call home?",""
"55049764-1-6677","Have you found my ring yet? I don't want to return to my mother without it.",""
"55049764-1-6678","You closed the Daedric portal!  Moonhenge is back to its old self, plus a few decorations. But where's the Captain?",""
"55049764-1-6679","Good luck, friend. Save a few ogrims for us. We'll meet you upstairs as soon as we can.",""
"55049764-1-6681","I'm not surprised <<1>> sealed herself in that tomb. Everyone knows how she felt about <<2>>.nnWhen a puppy follows you day and night, it wants the occasional scratch behind the ears. More fool him!",""

"55049764-1-6683","Hushed voices and furtive glances. This isn't going to be good.",""
"55049764-1-6684","Good luck out there. This one will stay here for a moment. Relax, so that no one says we do not fit in.",""
"55049764-1-6685","It is never a good sign when mages keep plans secret. Azsu knows this.",""
"55049764-1-6686","Thank you for the books, but <<1>> does not want you to forget what is owed!",""
"55049764-1-6687","Glad you're up and about, recruit. I'm in need of a scout to head to <<1>>. Most of our fleet foundered to the west, but we've had few survivors trickle in from that direction.",""
"55049764-1-6688","All of this death is needless.",""
"55049764-1-6689","First the hurricane, then rats from the sea. What next, flying mudcrabs?nnS'rendarr's mercy, we need more time before the inspection!",""
"55049764-1-6691","Was the treethane as rude to you as she was to me? All I asked was how one might get an audience with the Wilderking, but the way she reacted, you would have thought I was trying to slaughter her children.nnDid she treat you any differently?",""
"55049764-1-6692","Good luck.",""
"55049764-1-6693","If you have come to speak with the king, the gods smile upon you, for he is holding court.nnDo not presume to waste his time though. He has urgent matters to deal with, and has no time for trifles.",""
"55049764-1-6694","I am so ready to shake the dust of this place from my boots.",""
"55049764-1-6695","I find it pleasing to take in the air of this city once in a while. Even if it means I must subject myself to the presence of Wayrest's less …  desireables.",""

"55049764-1-6698","Father's breathing grows ragged. This one doesn't know what else to do.",""

"55049764-1-6702","Help us please.",""
"55049764-1-6703","Why did I let my brother drag me into this?",""
"55049764-1-6705","This one will make sure Kargand recovers. Thank you for your help in freeing us both.",""
"55049764-1-6706","This body is crude, but it will suffice. Thank you, mortal creature. You won't mind if I make some modifications, will you?",""

"55049764-1-6920","The Justice dishonors all Crowns with such barbarism. Tu'whacca will judge him harshly when Istah dies, I assure you.",""
"55049764-1-6921","By the Eight! I'm so glad to see another living soul!",""
"55049764-1-6922","It is vitally important that we take the Chasm. If we fail, we'll never be able to cross into Molag Bal's inner sanctum and reach the portal to the planar vortex.nnCadwell will aid you. He sees the world in a different way, but he's a good man.",""
"55049764-1-6923","Very impressive. Shazah and Khali are lucky to have someone like you as their guardian.",""
"55049764-1-6924","Yes, hello. Unfortunately, I have no time to chat. I own a busy and prosperous mine. Can't get behind in my paperwork.",""
"55049764-1-6925","Istah thumped me for ""public drunkenness"" once. I say, whats the point of private drunkenness? Those're the folks with real problems, right? Right?",""
"55049764-1-6926","Well done, Hallowed. I know the Queen values your contributions to the Dominion.",""
"55049764-1-6927","I forsee great things in the Khajiiti people's future. It's an honor to have been present for such an important ritual.",""
"55049764-1-6928","Well done! I have every confidence that you're the Moon Hallowed these women need.",""
"55049764-1-6929","So Istah's been clinkity-clanking around in his shiny armor kidnaping folks and hiding their bodies? Alone? I don't buy it. nnEither way, Samhudah's still paying me a fortune to stare at a door. So all's well in Mauloch's eyes, eh?",""
"55049764-1-6930","My father sent me away when he found out that I helped you. He couldn't bring himself to end my life, even though that's what the sentence called for.nnI've never felt so alone before. What I did though … it was right. It had to be done.",""
"55049764-1-6931","We've done it. We've completed the Two Moons Path. It's all over now.",""
"55049764-1-6932","They've put our Justice in the stocks. Akatosh help us. His bailiffs are even more inept than he is.",""
"55049764-1-6933","Why haven't you talked to that other Argonian over there yet?",""
"55049764-1-6937","Poor Istah. Such a stout fellow. nnHe never really extended the hand of friendship to Uncle Thakh, though. Perhaps his successor will be more … sociable.",""
"55049764-1-6938","My killer comes to humiliate me once again? Well, know that your luck won't help you here.nnI do hope you compete in this game. I so want to get another chance to rip out your heart and pull out your spine!",""
"55049764-1-6939","I'm glad that the Imperial has found someone else to talk to. His haughtiness is suffocating.",""
"55049764-1-6941","Scourge take them! The Elder Scroll of Chim has been stolen! I can tell you of the Elder Scrolls, but you will not feel their holy presence until our scroll returns.",""
"55049764-1-6945","I knew that Crown Istah was untrustworthy, but to murder that many people? nnIf he would only confess it would probably go easier for him.",""
"55049764-1-6946","I heard that that oafish Justice was arrested. What a delightful irony! I've been on his list of suspects for some timeI just know it.",""
"55049764-1-6948","You have what I asked for?",""
"55049764-1-6949","Thank you. I'm free again, finally. Time to leave this blasted cave. I hope whatever it was you were hoping to happen does, in fact, happen.",""
"55049764-1-6950","Wait … I know you. Why do you continue to hound me? Didn't you already celebrate your little victory with the pretty little princess, Ayrenn?nnDon't tell me you've entered this contest, as well? How … intriguing.",""
"55049764-1-6951","Again you remind me of the monster that I am. You defeated me in life, what more do you ask of me?nnWhat do you hope to accomplish by showing up here again?",""
"55049764-1-6952","Truly, I hope we never need change a story so extensively again. Though we spinners can do so, it's usually better to let a tale conclude on its own.nnUsually.",""
"55049764-1-6953","What foul magic is this? It's as if we've been plunged into a realm where the blight has taken over. Did you hear that voice? It referred to this as the ""Shadow Wood.""nnWhatever it is, it's not good. Not good at all.",""
"55049764-1-6954","She seemed very upset. Very upset!",""
"55049764-1-6955","Aranias was guided here to take my place, but I believe you were guided here to assure her ascension.nnIf you had not come, I fear Andur would have killed us both, leaving the Valenwood wild and vengeful. Many lives would have been lost.",""
"55049764-1-6956","You shall find her in the tunnels below.",""
"55049764-1-6957","I'm scared. Shouldn't I be feeling confident? I mean, we defeated Andur.nnLook at all of this though! I've worked my magic on small pieces of land in the Summerset Isles … but this is an entire forest … a living forest. Tell me I can do this.",""
"55049764-1-6958","There, you should be able to get inside without trouble now. Be mindful of the Worms inside  they are a dangerous lot, as you well know.",""
"55049764-1-6967","What? Are you one of <<1>>'s thugs come to harass me again? You want your arm broken, too?",""
"55049764-1-6968","We came far too close to a tragedy here. If we'd wrongly slain Alanya ….",""
"55049764-1-6969","Back to training for me. Maybe if I ignore them, these louts Gudarz has brought in will go away.",""
"55049764-1-6970","The Elder Scroll of Alma Ruma has been stolen! I can tell you of the Elder Scrolls, but this temple is an empty shell until our scroll returns.",""
"55049764-1-6971","I'd probably be a stew if it hadn't been for you. Thank you.",""
"55049764-1-6972","Once you put the boot to that spineless Nord we can finally have our camp back.",""
"55049764-1-6973","You don't look like one of these flea-bitten bandits. Have you come to join the actual militia?",""
"55049764-1-6974","Travel to the Labyrinth and stop Aranias.",""
"55049764-1-6975","Istah's collusion with those Forebear dogs has finally born its bitter fruit. May Tu'whacca show him mercy, for we Crowns will not.",""
"55049764-1-6976","This would be quite a charming view if not for all these oafish Crowns muddying it with their drab attire and sour faces. I honestly have no idea how they live like this.",""
"55049764-1-6977","Don't mind me. You seem a bit busy. We can talk later.",""
"55049764-1-6978","We should be wary. The way is guarded.",""
"55049764-1-6979","You know what's best after such a fine meal? A nice soak! The water in our pools is just exquisite!",""
"55049764-1-6980","Take your time and freshen up. The celebration in honor of Stibbons will be starting shortly.",""
"55049764-1-6981","I never thought that nightmare was going to end. Thank you for helping us.",""
"55049764-1-6982","Why should I talk to you?",""
"55049764-1-6983","These little militia bugs do a good job of keeping our camp going, gonna be sad when we run the last of them out.",""
"55049764-1-6984","Isn't it nice that the militia is giving us this camp?",""
"55049764-1-6985","I'm getting real tired of these militia rats.",""
"55049764-1-6986","Stop looking at my tusks. Stop it.",""
"55049764-1-6993","Now that we don't have to worry about overwhelming hordes of reinforcements, we're sending in the main assault force.nnWhile they keep Molag Bal's minions busy, you need to navigate the Labyrinth and find the portal to the planar vortex.",""
"55049764-1-6994","Have you selected a companion to accompany you? If you need more time to speak with your friends, please take it. This might be the last chance you get.nnWhen you're ready, I'll give you final instructions and we can begin our final assault.",""
"55049764-1-6995","Something's changed. I do not understand what is going on here.",""
"55049764-1-7004","The Fighters Guild is ready. We're prepared to follow you into the very heart of Molag Bal's lair.nnWe shall not fail you.",""
"55049764-1-7005","Well, I won't say that wasn't at least a little entertaining, but we're not finished yet.nnTime to enter the Labyrinth, old friend.",""
"55049764-1-7006","Let's tear this coward apart! Let's make Molag Bal wish he had never been born!nnWait a minute. Are Daedric Princes born? It doesn't matter! He'll wish something when we're done with him!",""
"55049764-1-7007","My people have been used and abused by the Lord of Brutality for long enough. Tonight, Molag Bal will feel the full ferocity of my mighty warriors.",""
"55049764-1-7009","Mistress Kauzanabi-jo will set you on your path, Hallowed. Good luck.",""
"55049764-1-7012","Listen to this, Kireth: ""Reach out and touch a brazier to draw forth the fire and launch it in the direction of your choosing.""nnHow fascinating! I wonder what it means?",""
"55049764-1-7013","Why do Daedra never install guardrails? It's like they want Zur to step into the bottomless chasm and fall to his death.nnZur has mentioned how much he hates heights, yes?",""
"55049764-1-7014","I recognize these devices. I've researched them. Even written reports about them. Never saw one in person, though.nnThey are marvelous to behold. Only a god could craft an artifact of such brilliance.",""
"55049764-1-7015","I'm ready to show the Dark Lord a little brutality of my own!",""
"55049764-1-7016","I promised to help you if you helped me, and here I am! I do not regret what we did to liberate my clan, and I never will.nnDo you smell that? That's the smell of freedom. And it smells wonderful!",""
"55049764-1-7017","You need someone to accompany you into the Dark Lord's lair? You freed the lamias from our prison, let me help free you from yours.",""
"55049764-1-7018","The Crown of Bones' power will grant us victory this day!nnI can't wait to see what treasures await us inside the Endless Stair.",""
"55049764-1-7019","This is so exciting! I sat around in a drunken stupor for so long, it feels so good to be finally doing something!nnOf course, we are going up against Molag Bal. Maybe I picked the wrong day to stop drinking.",""
"55049764-1-7021","You were a worthy opponent in the Orchard. I'm almost disappointed that we must now fight alongside instead of against each other.nnStill, the Crimson-Matron has sent me to honor your agreement, and I shall not fail you.",""
"55049764-1-7026","Ah yes! Did he find you? You must go to Tava's Blessing at once to help the prince!nnOh, and speak to Captain Rawan, tell him to send Shiri back here right away. Whether she wants to come or not!",""
"55049764-1-7027","<<1>> rescued me, though I guess I owe you thanks, too.nnShe seems nervousyou might want to talk to her.",""
"55049764-1-7028","Tava's Blessing is where the royal navy has its shipyards. You must not let the town fall to the Withered Hand.nnBeware of the shifting sands, wayfarer. I hope Rupta guides you quickly to the prince's side.",""
"55049764-1-7029","Get on with itI can't do anything until you distract my father with a challenge.",""
"55049764-1-7030","We won't be able to use the portal until someone destroys those focus stones.",""
"55049764-1-7031","Another ally is always welcome! Join us! They will not take usnot alive, nor dead!",""
"55049764-1-7034","The matchmaker's interesting. He could sell scales to an Argonian, if you ask me.",""
"55049764-1-7035","Get out of my camp, while you still can.",""
"55049764-1-7038","If it's equipment you want, talk to Elthras. He makes the deals around here.",""
"55049764-1-7039","We won a necessary victory for the Dominion today, and we have you to thank.",""
"55049764-1-7040","I'm getting ready to cart this mead to the Vinedusk Rangers, at the village northwest of here. Everyone here thinks they're crazy, but I've been carting mead to them for ages. As long as they keep buying, they can be as crazy as they want.",""
"55049764-1-7041","Off to adventure in this cave full of bloodthirsty spiders, are you? Awful brave of you, facing so many monsters. Hope you brought some friends!",""
"55049764-1-7042","The Halls of TormentI've never been there, and for that, I consider myself very fortunate.",""
"55049764-1-7043","It looks like I have a long journey ahead of me.",""
"55049764-1-7044","Your loyalty to the crown will be rewarded, my friend. You have my word.nnI can even make this easier for you. Wear this Imperial Armor, and you should be able to walk around the city unnoticed.",""
"55049764-1-7045","That Zara will flirt with anyone, or anything, but put a sword in her hand and watch the limbs fly.",""
"55049764-1-7046","The information you provided was very useful.",""
"55049764-1-7047","Hail, sister. nnWord has reached us that Talia now leads the tribe. Know that we stand ready to fight, should the shadow fall on Bergama.",""
"55049764-1-7048","May Tall Papa guide you on your walkabout, wherever your journey takes you.",""
"55049764-1-7049","I am extremely pleased to see you. nnI always thought the Imperials were civilized, but the way they've treated us, they're absolutely swine!",""
"55049764-1-7050","Praise Zeht! I can no longer abide these infidels!nnDid King Fahara'jad send his army?",""
"55049764-1-7051","Hail, sister. It is good that you have come. nnThe Withered Hand has been hereI can feel it. Stay vigilant.",""
"55049764-1-7052","You there! The Maormer attacked <<1>> with their Sea Viper forces. We need every able body for the rescue effort!",""
"55049764-1-7053","Thank the gods. I hope you're not too late. More Imperials are coming into Satakalaam every day. nnWe need to take back the city before they dig in.",""
"55049764-1-7054","Perhaps someday we will no longer feel the need to fight each other so readily. We shall see.",""
"55049764-1-7055","You filthy dog! You can hurt me if you wish, but I swear, you will pay for attacking our city …nnTu'whacca's Breath! You are not one of them. Did the king send his army then? These Imperials could launch a full invasion if they are not stopped.",""
"55049764-1-7056","Despite the armor, it is obvious that you are no Imperial, and I rejoice that you have come to my rescue. nnThe Imperials have mistreated me, but I deemed it likely that they would seize control of all Alik'r, and there would be nowhere to flee to.",""
"55049764-1-7057","This one will be the next champion. Stay out of my way if you don't like the sight of blood. Especially your own.",""
"55049764-1-7058","I understand why you did what you did. In time, I hope my tribe will as well.",""
"55049764-1-7059","Bless you, traveler. I hope I said nothing to offend you.",""
"55049764-1-7060","Fight or begone. I have no patience for unhatched eggs.",""
"55049764-1-7061","Very good! That is all of the tears. This one is finally done with this nightmare-scape of Dremora and beautiful, though terrifying, bodies of water.",""
"55049764-1-7062","No end to these winged rats. Not that I'm complaining! Every feather's worth a fortune in gold to us now!nnYou one of the magistrate's charges? I'm only shooting the ones in town, don't worry.",""
"55049764-1-7063","I've lived in this town for almost thirty years. We've never had any problems with the harpies in all that time.nnSomething foul's on the wind. I know it.",""
"55049764-1-7064","Well, it is good you took the lid off when you did. It was getting stuffy in there.",""
"55049764-1-7066","You must leave now. What transpires next is between Hircine and myself.nnThank you.",""
"55049764-1-7067","Keep under cover if you want to stay clean and dry. The harpies know no end to their wicked deeds.",""
"55049764-1-7068","Go on in. I'll climb up the building from the outside"," the harpies won't hurt me. Meet me on the balcony with whatever you find."
"55049764-1-7069","The troops can handle reclaiming the sanctuary, but we can only really end this if we cut off the head. Vicereeve Pelidil is getting further away from us every moment we delay.",""
"55049764-1-7070","Keep an eye out for my soldiers. I'm sure they'll help you hook some Fish Elves.",""
"55049764-1-7071","Give those Maormer a few kicks to the shin, would you?",""
"55049764-1-7072","I'll be right behind you.",""
"55049764-1-7073","This place sounds great! My brother says you can buy anything there. And I mean anything.",""
"55049764-1-7074","This one has heard some dark words about Pa'alat's master. He does not know if this Krin Ren-dro can be trusted.",""
"55049764-1-7075","I bet with both flywheels turning, we can get into Molag Grunda's lair.",""
"55049764-1-7079","You should get out of here! This town isn't safe for Daggerfall soldiers.",""
"55049764-1-7080","You must be a scout for the Covenant. Tell your commander that Therich Rorielle will be happy to see the Daggerfall banner fly over Castle Brindle!",""

"55049764-1-7082","At least it's over now. We stopped the blight from spreading and defeated Naemon's servant … but at such cost.nnI worry about our decision to sacrifice the Eldest's Heart. Its absence will be felt, and without a replacement … well, I don't know.",""
"55049764-1-7083","You scouting Castle Brindle? I wish the Covenant would hurry up and take it!",""
"55049764-1-7084","You draw the sword for us all, sister. True honor need … need not be named.  Avenge us.",""
"55049764-1-7085","Just get out of here, out! You'll bring the guards down on us!",""
"55049764-1-7088","You bear the tribe's burdens now, brother. Remembertrue honor need not be named. Seek not fame or glory, only justice.",""
"55049764-1-7089","Do not look upon me with pity, sister. Hearts such as ours, crowded with great and terrible purpose, have no room for such things.",""
"55049764-1-7090","Fill this poisoned cup with our enemies' blood, sister. All of the Alik'r watches you. May Tava speed your passage.",""
"55049764-1-7091","Word swirls through camp like a dust devil. So you are Ash'abah now? That is good, sister. nnTrue honor need not be named. Send the Withered Hand back to Oblivion.",""
"55049764-1-7092","Welcome to the tribe, sister. I regret we have nothing to give but our blessings.",""
"55049764-1-7093","Both Zamyad and Parvenah took to the Far Shores during your trial, sister. I fear we will lose even more swords yet.",""
"55049764-1-7094","If you spot Donus on the way to Cheydinhal, please tell him I'm out here, looking for him.",""
"55049764-1-7095","True honor need not be named, sister. May your blade never go thirsty while these fiends still draw breath.",""

"55049764-1-7098","Hail, sister. The poison of Morwha's Bounty has run its course, thank Ruptga. It would take ten and ten to keep me from my work. Rumor swirls across the dunes. Some say there is a vampiric curse staining Leki's Blade, and now we have found proof.",""
"55049764-1-7099","True honor need not be named, sister. My son's sickness broke while you took on the crucible. You are indeed blessed by the Divines!",""

"55049764-1-7119","You'll find Ugorz in the Orc stronghold to the east, and Zirani in the Khajiit village in the west. Both were once-flourishing townshipsbut no longer. They'll need help to escape.",""
"55049764-1-7120","Let's clean these guys out!",""

"55049764-1-7243","We are safe here, at least, outside of the notice of Oblivion and whoever called it upon Dune. Many of us here are not walkers of the Two-Moons Path, though. This one wonders if a rabble of merchants unsound in body and spirit can survive this mess.",""
"55049764-1-7245","The dung life heaps upon this one is just too much! You might think, when traveling with your wares, that this thing or that thing will sell for quite a price to the merchants of your home. But nothing can prepare you for a home ablaze!",""
"55049764-1-7247","A walker comes to Dune! Is there anything that can be done for this place? Yanu-ma asks, for she is unclawed in matters concerning Daedra - as are most walkers in Dune, she thinks. All I can do is have food ready for those with claws enough to fight.",""
"55049764-1-7248","Masrabal-dro knows many things, has seen many things. Many daedra emerge from gates in Dune, and situations like this? They tend to work themselves out, this one knows, and has seen in the past, many times. So, this one remains prepared to trade.",""

"55049764-1-7251","The guild is always open to fellow mages… provided no other disasters fall upon Dune.",""
"55049764-1-7252","So many people! When did our quiet little city become a metropolis? But business has been good.",""
"55049764-1-7253","I'm not sure I like that we've turned the Hollow City into an army camp, but I can't complain about the increase in business.",""
"55049764-1-7254","Thanks to the stable portals, for once I'm in no danger of running out of supplies.",""
"55049764-1-7255","I think I liked this place better when there were only five of us living here.",""

"55049764-1-7259","By Onsi's bright blade, if one of those stinking mercenaries lays a hand on me, I'll split him like a dried gourd.",""
"55049764-1-7260","Those damned harpies made off with another of my ponies. By Saint Alessia, another week of this and I'll be walking back to Chorrol barefoot.",""

"55049764-1-7265","Walker, tell Four-Toes what you have seen? He has heard screams and the ring of steel, and his heart fills with dread for the city of Dune. This one stands in his stall with his wares, if you wish to trade. Better to die with gold in pocket.",""

"55049764-1-7268","I do not know who's doing more property damagethe harpies or those twice-cursed mercenaries. Either way, I've been pumping the bellows like mad.",""
"55049764-1-7269","Whatever has fallen upon Dune, let them come to Kurnamu-do! Here, we have the advantage of terrain. No assailant shall make it past this one's flashing steel!",""
"55049764-1-7270","These damnable harpies! A seamstress of my quality should not be stuck mending curtains!",""
"55049764-1-7271","The sellswords are not as bad as everyone says. Better to have drunken louts for protection than none at all. Is it not so?",""
"55049764-1-7272","The mercenaries seemed so professional when they arrived. It was quite heartening. But they did not keep their true natures hidden for long.",""
"55049764-1-7273","A desperate man turns his back on wisdom. Better to unleash a pack of rabid hounds than for our magistrate to welcome into town cutthroats like the Gold Coast Mercenaries. nnDogs and sons of dogs, all of them.",""
"55049764-1-7274","Of all the places for the harpies to strike, they choose our beloved Kozanset. nnTall Papa help us.",""

"55049764-1-7280","They should set those good-for-nothing Baandari Khajiiti on the bird-women. By Mauloch, they'd probably enjoy it.",""
"55049764-1-7281","Hail and welcome, comrade. Shake off the sand and relax a moment. I'd say you've earned a rest.",""

"55049764-1-7284","Magister Zoellene keeps us cloistered while those oafish mercenaries roam the streets. We wield the power arcane. Should we not use it in defense of our neighbors?",""

"55049764-1-7295","I've heard rumors of this city even while back in Tamriel. A city of Cyrodiil that was one day there, the next day gone. Even the most recognized scholars had a hard time justifying its existence.nnBut here we stand in the lost city itself.",""
"55049764-1-7296","That idiot just blew my cover. I respect the Artisan's skill too much to believe that Hendare could find him, so what's your story?",""

"55049764-1-7336","Forgive Split-Tongue his split tongue, please. Though many mock him, he still sees his friends about this tree, here.nnIt is where we tend to meet and talk of our days, walker. Every village must have one, no?",""
"55049764-1-7339","Warm sands, walker. This one invites you to enjoy the shade of our tree and our company, as this one and her friends so often do.nnThis one thinks it is better under the tree when certain merchants are no longer screaming and grunting, though!",""
"55049764-1-7340","Khajiit are friendly enough, I guess. But the little things they do when they talk to you…nnI don't know, I always feel like they're thinking about eating me. I just don't find them appetizing, so it feels unfair.nnI suppose.",""
"55049764-1-7341","Damn that Molag Bal!",""
"55049764-1-7342","A miserable end to a pilgrimage, walker. This one arrived, to find this Stonefire cult has taken Do'Krin for its own. Moons above, what can be done? What of the Golden Claw?",""
"55049764-1-7343","The situation is far worse than I could have imagined. Maybe we truly aren't safe.",""
"55049764-1-7344","Everything we've done against the Tharns, everything that's happened to our fragile alliance … was it not enough?",""
"55049764-1-7345","Those cultists have certainly made a mess of things, Anil-do has seen. If Anil-do had more five-clawed walkers at his back, Do'Krin could be set aright, and things much better.",""
"55049764-1-7346","Shirai-ma sees such horrible things, even just across the bridge. How can this have happened? The roads were so safe!",""
"55049764-1-7347","You're going to die, milk-drinker!nnYou're going to get lanced through your arse, and you'll die on the arena floor in a mess of your own making, because you're not good enough for this arena!",""

"55049764-1-7353","It seems you will contend before I will.nnI hope you keep your head long enough. By the looks of you, yours would be a fine head to be tearing off, heh.",""

"55049764-1-7355","No, no. If you're fighting you can't place any bets.nnThis one has seen it happen, it is considered 'cheating', and the beatings those who do this receive are inspiring to behold.nnVery inspiring, this one thinks - enough to say 'no, never.'",""
"55049764-1-7356","Hmm. Come here, sera. Let me have a look at you.nnI'm considering the guar I'm betting on in this race, you see. You look strong enough. But, well … so does everyone, you see?",""
"55049764-1-7360","Don't worry, Nellor won't be tricking travelers again anytime soon. Thank you for bringing him to justice.",""

"55049764-1-7371","Honor to you and your house, sera. I'm here on House Telvanni business, what brings you?nnWhatever does bring you, may it be swiftly resolved. This caravan is a mess and its drivers s'wit. It's all I can do not to drown myself in greef.",""
"55049764-1-7372","Gore and glory!nnAny time you need a drink, just come to me. The elf-lovers here wouldn't know a good brew if it boiled their faces off.",""
"55049764-1-7373","Warm sands, walker. This unsleek and unfragrant place is an excellent place to sell your goods. Thus, this one remains willing to trade.",""
"55049764-1-7374","You have some claws, khajiit, this one recognizes that. Do you have all five, perhaps? We shall see as you hunt the walls of Thizzrini.nnStill, you seem sleek enough. Sleek and dangerous. This one is glad for your presence, very … amusing.",""

"55049764-1-7376","So much death and destruction. I don't know why I'm surprised. I never expected Coldharbour to be a walk in the snow.",""

"55049764-1-7387","Hello, wayfarer. If I am not mistaken, you are the one I was told to look out for.nnI was asked to relay a message if I were to see you.",""
"55049764-1-7388","Your time here is done. But others still need to talk to you.",""
"55049764-1-7389","Oh! That was close! I almost put an arrow right between your eyes!nnI'm glad I didn't. With so few of us remaining, we need all the help we can get.",""
"55049764-1-7395","If Raz had known you would do so well, he would have scrounged you a nicer reward. Apologies. The Mistral armory is not what it once was.",""
"55049764-1-7402","A coin for a child of the hungy moon?",""
"55049764-1-7407","News of this Indaenir intrigue me. Everyone I've spoken to about him says he possesses a sense beyond even the most talented scoutpowers we do not fully understand.nnKeep him close. I believe he may be more important to us than we now know.",""
"55049764-1-7408","Did one of our scouts find you and send you this way? It doesn't matter, we're desperately in need of assistance.nnIf you are willing to help us, please step inside the cave behind me and speak with our treethane.",""
"55049764-1-7410","You need a citizen to stand in testimony against the accused, as well as physical evidence and a magical omen to bring a case forward. nnI recommend talking to my fellow townsfolk and searching the village for evidence.",""
"55049764-1-7411","I did not mean to hurt anyone! It was just a plant!",""
"55049764-1-7412","I'm eager to hear your findings, advocate.",""
"55049764-1-7413","We stand ready to hear your findings, advocate. I encourage you to ask the suspects about any evidence you've found before making an accusation.",""
"55049764-1-7415","We have always been a close-knit community, and many relationships were tried and fragmented in this ordeal. It will take a while to recover.nnNevertheless, we are at peace with the forest once more, and that's all thanks to you.",""

"55049764-1-7418","Dark clouds gather over Aldcroft. You don't need magicka to see that. But … sorry. You want to talk guild business, I'm sure.",""
"55049764-1-7419","Learn to control your anger and use it to fuel your most powerful attacks! So ends today's lesson. But then, you aren't in the guild yet.",""
"55049764-1-7420","Crosswych needs a stronger Mages Guild presence. Hmm … oh, excuse me! Sorry, just lost in thought. What can I do for you?",""

"55049764-1-7423","That did make sense, didn't it?",""
"55049764-1-7424","Don't make any sudden moves, or I'll give you wings. Arrow wings. Because arrows have feathers? Ah, forget it.",""
"55049764-1-7425","So you're the common trash that Calastil hired to steal my cane?",""
"55049764-1-7426","You. You're that thief Laurosse paid to steal my husband's dog. I hope the rats eat your eyes when they lock you in the dungeon.",""
"55049764-1-7427","How low Earrastel has fallen, dealing with filth like you to take what he wants.",""
"55049764-1-7428","Oh I know, the whole thing seems rather rash and improbable, doesn't it?nnBut our methods get results. Bring back the rat parts, and we'll have a little rodent scurrying about in no time. Why, it will be almost lifelike!",""
"55049764-1-7429","Still a little sore, but I'll be strong as a mammoth in no time.",""
"55049764-1-7430","I wish you sharp claws and clear night skies in your travels, Hallowed.",""
"55049764-1-7432","Are you collecting junk for Adamiir's little monsters? Good.nnI make little monsters too. See this? It's a ant-fly-worm beast. I mashed them together and added a pinch of Adamir's life juice. It's an adorably gross little guy, isn't it?",""
"55049764-1-7433","Back again, I see. And looking better than ever! I hope you're loaded up with Red Mountain Ash. I can almost taste that Nirnroot wine now. Almost.",""
"55049764-1-7434","My heart lightens to see you again, friend. How did you fare?",""
"55049764-1-7435","Oh! About time you arrived. Listen, Blackheart is down on the shore somewhere.nnHe likes to pace the beach when he's on shore leave. And he doesn't find it funny when I point that out to him. Can you blame me for jumping ship?",""
"55049764-1-7437","Use the portal to take the battle to them! I'll hold the ship.",""
"55049764-1-7438","I just guard the barricade. If you have questions, speak with <<1>>.",""
"55049764-1-7439","<<1>> can answer your questions, citizen.",""
"55049764-1-7440","Did the mammoth escape again? You'd be surprised how such a large animal can disappear so quickly.",""
"55049764-1-7441","You're alive! Does that meandid you kill the troll?",""
"55049764-1-7443","Head to the Barrowbough. <<1>> will get you inside, I'm sure of it.",""
"55049764-1-7444","Can't say where the Albatross will head next, but you're always welcome aboard. None of us will forget what you did here.nnAnd <<1>> won't forget, either.",""
"55049764-1-7445","So Treethane Rolon has you looking into the destruction of the sacred flower. nnI hope you understand this isn't just about a plant. The Green Pact defines us. Our whole way of life is based on it. I hope you take the investigation seriously.",""
"55049764-1-7446","Thank you for returning my commemorative censer. The Dominion brought Erinel and I together. Now if I could only untangle this line …",""
"55049764-1-7447","I heard you've been made Pact Advocate. Is this true? nnI want to help in any way I can. The Green Pact is sacred and the person who broke it must be brought to justice.",""
"55049764-1-7448","Oh! About time you got here. Listen, Blackheart is down there somewhere. You're going to have to find him and kill him. I will come find you afterwards.",""
"55049764-1-7449","Did you get it? Did you find the wasp?",""
"55049764-1-7450","May the great tree Brackenleaf hold you in his leafy embrace, fellow-Briar.",""
"55049764-1-7451","Pray at the brazier of your spirit animal and receive Brackenleaf's blessing. Then return to me for the final initiation.",""
"55049764-1-7452","I do not look forward to running through the sewers. There's a smell you can taste.",""
"55049764-1-7453","Have you, by chance, glimpsed an older gentleman wandering these tunnels?nnBalding, paunchy, dressed too well to be gallivanting in the sewers?",""
"55049764-1-7454","I told you not to follow me. I didn't want anyone else to die. Why did you have to follow me?",""
"55049764-1-7455","By the Eight it's cold! I … where am I?",""
"55049764-1-7456","Don't worry. I'm a friend. The disorientation you're feeling is natural. It will pass.nnIt's been a while since Glaras sent anyone here. She's been more cautious since the boy Eringor nearly died.",""
"55049764-1-7457","If you want to join my Briars, then there is one more question you must answer. With which of the spirits of the hunt do you feel most closely alignedthe dark deception of the Snake, the dominance of the Tiger, or the cooperation of the Wolf?",""
"55049764-1-7458","We'll keep watch for another decade. We must be certain they will not return.",""
"55049764-1-7459","Welcome back to Coldharbour, old chum. Jolly good to see you! I was afraid you'd snuffed it.",""
"55049764-1-7460","I wonder what Rurelion would say if he knew I was this close to a Dremora?nnBut to be completely honest with you, she makes me a little nervous.",""
"55049764-1-7461","The power unleashed by that Daedric fireastounding! Imagine the spells I could command if I could harness that energy.",""
"55049764-1-7463","You've done much to help the village. None of us will forget you. But now, I must ask you to leave me to my fate.",""
"55049764-1-7464","Erunor? Where is he? He's not coming, is he?",""
"55049764-1-7465","What jolly good fun! I believe the next stop is the Labyrinth, old chum. Shall we toddle off?",""
"55049764-1-7466","We know what you're trying to do. For what it's worth, I wish you luck with it.",""
"55049764-1-7467","It's better to know what happened to my lovely wife than to spend my days wondering.nnThank you.",""
"55049764-1-7468","Are you prepared for what awaits you?",""
"55049764-1-7469","Have you listened to everything Lord Varen had to say?",""
"55049764-1-7470","Lord Varen is not finished. Heed his words.",""
"55049764-1-7471","Varen still has something to say to you.",""
"55049764-1-7472","It is done, then? I would not have such courage. In my mind, you are a hero for what you have done.",""
"55049764-1-7473","I can't tell you what a relief it is to have your help. I'll stay here for a little while in case you have any questions, but then I'll head back to Shornhelm.nnI'll tell Magister Wulfdis I've dealt with the matter and he'll soon have his relic.",""
"55049764-1-7474","Have I convinced you, then? Are you ready to join up?",""
"55049764-1-7475","Hmm. This one smells some magic on you. Do you not sense it? Maybe Magrus licks your face while you sleep! Ha! nnYou should join the Mages Guild. We have much to teach you, walker.",""
"55049764-1-7476","The Elder Scroll of Ghartok is back in our hands, thanks to the courage and strength of our warriors!",""
"55049764-1-7477","Your father's words nearly bring me to tears, so proud am I to serve a king of such courage.nnGo forth, Sameer. Go forth and make your father proud.",""
"55049764-1-7478","The ring is ours for the time being. Guard it well.",""
"55049764-1-7481","I thank you for not condemning me. Even if you don't believe me, I appreciate the chance to clear my name.nnThough, if you cannot find the thief … I won't think about that yet.",""
"55049764-1-7482","You look like you know your way around a fight. You'd make a good Guild member. Ever consider it?",""
"55049764-1-7483","The Guild is wherever we need to be. One day we'll have guildhouses in every city, but until then, tents will suffice.",""
"55049764-1-7484","Before you ask, yes, Altmer can fight, even here. The Guild welcomes all, and isn't involved in current politics.",""
"55049764-1-7485","Make it quick. The Guild doesn't have time to waste.",""
"55049764-1-7487","There's no denying that some of the workers made some bad decisions. But they're not the one who orchestrated it.nnThey were bribed to administer that poison to the johads. They swore they had no idea it would bring disaster upon us!",""
"55049764-1-7488","What do you say, recruit? Have I convinced you? Are you ready to join the fight?",""
"55049764-1-7489","I can't believe it. You mean Anenya was actually telling the truth?nnThat girl has failed every assignment I've given her. She doesn't have a shred of natural magic ability, but if you have the Tear of Anurraame, I have to admit, I'm impressed.",""
"55049764-1-7490","Hello! Are you here on business for the Guild?",""
"55049764-1-7491","Victims, that's all we are. If you're not in an army, you're prey.",""

"55049764-1-7493","Zaddo sets you on your path. Saifa sweeps the path with branches. Orthoron scurries through the underbrush. And Hadam-do lights the sky above you.",""
"55049764-1-7494","The moons speak to Saifa. They tell her of your journey with the Elves in darkness.",""
"55049764-1-7495","Good to see you again. Sorry, just trying to keep an eye on our friends out there.",""
"55049764-1-7496","Why would the Wood Orcs attack us? What did we do to them?",""
"55049764-1-7498","My father is getting crazy in his old age. What's so exciting about the mundane world?",""

"55049764-1-7500","I'm preparing a feast in your honor. Heart of the snake, tiger and wolf will be served. With a side of frog legs and mammoth tongue. We spared no expense!",""
"55049764-1-7501","Maintenance of our shrines is one of many duties of a Master Hunter. It may seem mundane, but taking care of the shrine is akin to taking care of yourself.",""
"55049764-1-7503","With all six Elder Scrolls in Covenant hands, our soldiers will defeat every foe we face on the battlefields of Cyrodiil!",""
"55049764-1-7505","I have a measure of peace. I have done as much as I could to help my town, to help Rivenspire. nnWe could not have contained that abomination without your aid. I am grateful.",""
"55049764-1-7506","<<AC:1>> was sealed for generations. There are many conflicting tales, but all agree that this was the resting place of <<2>>, a powerful necromancer and student of <<3>>.nnThe tales said nothing about shades.",""

"55049764-1-7510","Research. All I want to do is research! Why do I always end up in life-or-death situations?nnEither <<1>>'s cursed, or I am. Shades, boiling up from the ground? What next, trolls in heat?",""

"55049764-1-7518","Be on your guard. In addition to activating ancient defenses, Montclair has somehow awakened the Ayleid guardians that haunt these ruins. You may have to deal with them as well as you make your way into the first portal chamber.",""

"55049764-1-7520","It feels like there's a cloud hanging over the village. I don't like that, not at allit's bad for life, you see. Inside and outside.nnWho can say what will happen from here? Who could know such a thing?",""
"55049764-1-7522","Lots of arguing in the tribe. I don't like that kind of thing.",""

"55049764-1-7524","There are members of this tribe who are incapable of considering the ramifications of their actions in the long season.nnThe Bosmer welcomed us as they did for we are two peoples of two saps. We mirror them, as water does the sky.",""

"55049764-1-7924","Make sure to say hello to the grumpy Redguard over there. He may seem cranky, but he's a good man and a better vampire slayer.",""
"55049764-1-7925","If you are done delaying our mission, let the big Nord over there know.",""
"55049764-1-7927","The spider cave is near Camp Tamrith, but I wouldn't want to face the spider queen one-on-one, even if I wasn't a coward with a splitting headache.",""
"55049764-1-7928","I'm never drinking another drop. Just water for me from now on. Well, beer is mostly water. Just water. And beer.",""
"55049764-1-7929","I'm glad this <<1>> business is settled.nnBetween the two of us, I'm tired of all this talk of embassies.",""
"55049764-1-7930","The preparations for this ratification ceremony seem endless. But I'm up to the task.",""
"55049764-1-7933","Join me for a cup of mead. A toast to those we've lost. My parents to death and my sister to her crazy dreams. nnWe're all going to go sometime. We might as well have a drink or two before it happens.",""
"55049764-1-7934","That's far enough. The storeroom is off limits. <<1>>'s orders.",""
"55049764-1-7935","Please, look for Firaelion in the cave to the north. But be careful. I couldn't bear it if something happened to you, too.",""
"55049764-1-7936","I won't forget how you saved me from the spiders. If there's anything I can ever do for you, please don't hesitate to ask.",""
"55049764-1-7937","This will be a day long remembered.",""
"55049764-1-7938","Thank you, outsider.",""
"55049764-1-7939","Do it. And quickly.",""
"55049764-1-7940","Ah, the proven hunter. I see you have the briar heart, torn from the chest of the Reachman. His punishment for failure is to roam the Hunting Grounds as prey. His chest, a gaping hollow, a reminder of his weakness.",""
"55049764-1-7941","There! See, I told you it would work!",""
"55049764-1-7942","This spy business works a lot better if we don't stand around and talk about it all day.",""
"55049764-1-7943","What is going on? Is it true? Has someone sent an assassin after me?",""
"55049764-1-7944","I trust we can rely on you to be discreet about your involvement with us.",""
"55049764-1-7945","Saw you standing over the body of a dead Wood Elf. Nearly put an arrow in your throat.nnGood thing I recognize you.",""
"55049764-1-7946","I have things about as under control in here as they can be.nnYou should go on ahead - if you can do anything about our entrenchment here, please do.nnOur injured soldiers would thank you for it.",""
"55049764-1-7947","My head feels like a thunderbug crawled inside it.nnBut I did win our contest. Oblan will bring the laundry for you. Every morning.",""
"55049764-1-7948","Here we have the savior of Shornhelm, I presume? You should know that Baron Dorell and Countess Tamrith have been quite generous in their praise of you. nnI trust you were able to close this portal Montclair was using to bring in reinforcements?",""
"55049764-1-7949","My father has many friends in <<1>>. They'll see us out of this mess.",""
"55049764-1-7950","Not sure what's more surprisingthat we made it to Shornhelm or that you did. Did you find Marien's necklace?",""
"55049764-1-7951","Oh, hello! Our friend from the road. Nothing like good honest work to make you feel alive, am I right?",""
"55049764-1-7952","This Darien … I perhaps mistook him when we first met.nnHe is a caring man. Still a man who thinks not always with his head. But he has honor at least.",""
"55049764-1-7953","The shard holder, whoever it is, uses the power of the remnant to veil himself. Just like Lleraya did back in Northpoint. There's no way you're going to find him by yourself.nnThis is a trap that we have to step into.",""
"55049764-1-7954","By the look of things, you're probably one of the ones fighting the Reachmen. That's good.nnWe don't have dissimilar goals, but remember: That doesn't make us friends.",""
"55049764-1-7955","Hey! I'd recognize that bow anywhere. Where did you get that?",""
"55049764-1-7956","<<1>> said the entrance to the vampire's lord lair is in the valley north of town. We need to get there immediately.",""
"55049764-1-7957","Just place my family's ashes in each of the graves. Then I'll say a few words to send them on their way.",""
"55049764-1-7958","It's a great comfort to have you participate in this solemn occassion. I think my little brother would have liked you. A lot.",""
"55049764-1-7959","All that we can do, all that we can become, now that we are free, is halting. We do not know where to begin.",""
"55049764-1-7960","Look for a ship called the Dawn Posset offshore at Northpoint. The first mate, Elvira Derre, should be waiting for you on the docks, ready to leave for Sentinel.nnWhen you get there, just make sure the city is safe. Only visit my father if you wish.",""
"55049764-1-7961","Ah, good. You've returned. Sai Sahan has recovered, and there is much to be done.",""
"55049764-1-7962","The people of <<1>> will know what we've done for the Green Pact. The king won't have any recourse but to pardon us all.nnYou've done more for the Blacksap Rebellion than you'll ever know.",""
"55049764-1-7967","I need to look into a few lingering issues of my own here. I'll be along as soon as my brother tells me everything's ready.",""
"55049764-1-7968","Why do I think this isn't going to end wellfor me?",""
"55049764-1-7969","I've been thinking of Nedras a lot recently. I keep thinking I'll see him come through my door, hear his voice. But never again.",""
"55049764-1-7970","Ah, you return! And I can sense the Ayleid energy you carry, so I don't even need to ask whether you were successful. I hope you caused plenty of trouble for the Worm Cultists.",""
"55049764-1-7971","It's decided, then. I'm going to take up weaponsmithing. My father was always very handy with an anvil. Perhaps I'll try to earn an apprenticeship … sorry, please excuse me. I have a lot of planning to do!",""
"55049764-1-7972","Kala must consider how she will find the coin for travel. That brother of mine … never thinking of anything but the moons!",""
"55049764-1-7973","It's a disgrace. I fought by <<1>>'s side in the civil war. Things got so bad, we had to eat leather cut from our own armor.nnEven then, I never heard this amount of whining coming from the High Elves and the Khajiit about their embassy.",""
"55049764-1-7974","Completely unacceptable! If this is what <<1>> thinks of us, we should go back to Elsweyr!",""
"55049764-1-7975","Yours is truly a generous spirit to release me from this dark place, but I would be most ungrateful if I did not tell you the entire truth.nnIf I am truly to leave hereto put down new roots and find new lifemore is needed to be done.",""
"55049764-1-7976","Dark moons, stranger. While Silver-Paws and dungy Knight-Commander quibble over bow strings and bandages, food stockpiles shrink. nnWe must start hunting now, or we will all be dead before the next Tojay moon.",""
"55049764-1-7977","If you ask me, the Baron was too easy on his son. People died. On his watch. Blatant incompetence at its finest.",""
"55049764-1-7978","With so many knights injured here, there's great demand for fighters willing to take their places. Why not join the guild?",""
"55049764-1-7979","Grim scene out there, eh? Almost makes me feel bad for not helping out. nnBut hey, adversity builds character, right? Knights like to have character, I hear.",""
"55049764-1-7980","I am new to the Guild, but I think it's the life for me. Paid to fight! Sounds good to me.",""
"55049764-1-7981","My hunting companion was chased by a group of chanting cultists up near the <<1>>. What's this world coming to? I certainly can't make any sense of it.",""
"55049764-1-7982","These knights are fools if they think force of arms alone will retake the Garrison. Without magical assistance they'll be slaughtered.",""
"55049764-1-7983","Do you have a thirst for adventure, for knowledge, for the arcane? You've come to the right place. Join us!",""
"55049764-1-7984","Do not tarry here with the wounded. You must … you must retake the Garrison! Don't let our deaths be in vain.",""
"55049764-1-7985","She's going to kill me. In my sleep. I know she will.",""
"55049764-1-7986","Even now, some of my brother and sister knights call for another assault on the Garrison. But we can't even keep light skirmishers out of our camp. Attacking without reinforcement would be suicide.",""
"55049764-1-7987","Do you have a kill for me, pup? Did you bring me meat?",""
"55049764-1-7989","Thank you for assisting Lady Laurent while I was indisposed. nnI hope there are no lingering after-effects. She can be … rather demanding at times.",""
"55049764-1-7990","Daedra take these Imperials. By St. Pelin's blood, I'll see that fort retaken!",""
"55049764-1-7991","I envy my brothers' and sisters' optimism. In its current state, the Order of Saint Pelin could not mount a defense in depth, let alone take back a fortified garrison.",""
"55049764-1-7992","That was an experience I won't be forgetting anytime soon. I'd say that you went beyond the call of duty, but I think you went even beyond that.nnOf course, Septima was actually after you, wasn't she?",""
"55049764-1-7993","These cursed Baandari charge us a king's ransom for supplies, then refuse to assist us in reclaiming them? A pox on the lot of them.",""
"55049764-1-7995","Zeht's tears! What has befallen? Who has slain everyone? Where's the king?",""
"55049764-1-7996","Any luck? Did you find the source of the invaders?",""
"55049764-1-7997","I must thank you for the opportunity to see <<c:1>> operate as it did in ancient times. It's all so exciting!",""
"55049764-1-7999","The queen … she's radiant!",""
"55049764-1-8000","My notes? I can't believe it! I thought I'd lost these for good.",""
"55049764-1-8001","Quite impressive, stopping this attack on <<1>>. I'd say it's worthy of our king's notice.nn<<2>> is always pleased to meet extraordinary people who arrive in his lands.",""
"55049764-1-8002","You don't look like much. Why would Hircine send you to me as a challenger? Does he mock me? Or is there more to you than meets the eye?",""
"55049764-1-8004","Adeena may forgive me in time, but I will never forgive myself.",""
"55049764-1-8005","So. You killed it.",""
"55049764-1-8006","I wish I had heeded my sister's warnings rather than marry such a monster.",""
"55049764-1-8007","A nightmare from Oblivion visited upon our home. May the Roar of Alkosh burn these invaders away!",""
"55049764-1-8008","What do you think you're doing on my ship? Do you know what I did to the last stowaway I found?",""
"55049764-1-8009","Follow the pull of your blood and you will find the Tomb of the Blood Matron.",""
"55049764-1-8010","May the Father of Owls guide your steps, friend.",""
"55049764-1-8011","Not a lot of people simply walk in and volunteer to help fight with the resistance. Call me a skeptic, I suppose.",""
"55049764-1-8012","Watch your step in there. After all, you don't want to wind up stumbling into the afterlife … the gods don't like that.",""
"55049764-1-8013","I'm glad to be free of that monster's flesh, but I can't rest easy until I've passed from this plane.nnI died so long agoI would give anything to move on.",""
"55049764-1-8014","You have no idea what it feels like to have a Khajiit scratching around inside your head.",""
"55049764-1-8015","You did not see me, did you? No one sees the poor, the sick. The oppressed!nnYou help these people of Hallin's Stand, but for what? You put yourself in harm's way, but why?",""
"55049764-1-8016","I thought that brute was going to kill me! Thank you, stranger!",""
"55049764-1-8017","Away with you! Can't you see I'm busy?",""
"55049764-1-8019","What … who … how … oh, hello there.",""
"55049764-1-8020","So it's just us mortals from here on in? That's fine with me. I don't mind admitting that the idea of friendly vampires kind of creeps me out.",""
"55049764-1-8021","The Blacksap always knew the best hunting spots …",""
"55049764-1-8022","I sense great determination in you, living one, but very few of the living are foolish enough to trespass in these hallowed halls. nnEven fewer are foolish enough to seek entrance into the Chamber of Passage. This is your intention though, is it not?",""
"55049764-1-8023","Blacksap, Dominion? Who are we following now?",""
"55049764-1-8024","My husband would have been heartbroken if I spoke out against the Blacksap. I'm glad they're gone. Now we can all get back to our lives.",""
"55049764-1-8025","What will Cormount become without the Blacksap? There's no future for any of us.",""
"55049764-1-8026","The Blacksap are no more. What a pity.",""
"55049764-1-8027","Our people are doomed. The High Elves will stomp us out.",""
"55049764-1-8028","I know you, sister. You're one of us, even if you don't know it yet. Hircine calls you. His song is in your blood.",""
"55049764-1-8030","It takes a brave soldier to enter the Chamber of Passage, but courage alone is not what defines a warrior. nnOne has already breached the chamber without my blessing, but you come behind seeking just that, do you not?",""
"55049764-1-8031","This is an historic moment. You do realize that, don't you? nnWe're about to play a significant role in ending the haunting of Traitor's Tor and discovering the truth of King Ranser's final moments!",""
"55049764-1-8034","Finally, a chance for everyone to relax. Join us, if you like.",""
"55049764-1-8035","I appreciated your intervention earlier, but I am sure this conquest can be made without your help.",""
"55049764-1-8036","My beautiful abomination, how you shine in the dark. nnNow listen. I must warn you.",""
"55049764-1-8037","Go upstairs and get the inn key from Darien. Then we can find out what's locked in there and making all that racket.",""
"55049764-1-8039","Brackenleaf's Briars built this shrine, as tribute to the animals of <<1>>.",""
"55049764-1-8040","I sense you have been among that dark ruin, Gil-Var-Delle. Perhaps it was even you who fought back against the vile Worms. If that is true, you must have seen the scarring the land has suffered in that foul place. Maybe you can help me.",""
"55049764-1-8041","The Queen expects you presently. Proceed.",""
"55049764-1-8042","Go on, up the stairs with you. There's no reason to keep the beautiful Lady Lleraya waiting.",""
"55049764-1-8044","My performers can best explain their setbacks. <<1>> is our bug trainer, <<2>> our storyteller, and <<3>> is … well, she's magnificent.nnI have to describe her that way. It's in her contract.",""
"55049764-1-8046","Arkay protect you, my child.",""
"55049764-1-8047","The scrolls speak of the principles of Wisdom, Discipline, Sacrifice, and Devotion, and the seasons of life in which I mastered these principles.nnPlace them in the proper order in which they were mastered.",""
"55049764-1-8048","I wish I'd known she was in here all this time. The more the merrier, I always say.",""
"55049764-1-8049","Filthy, unclawed Bretons! How hard is it to watch over barrels and crates?",""
"55049764-1-8050","The customs clerk in <<1>> should be able to help you locate my shipment. The client is … not a patient woman, so do hurry.",""
"55049764-1-8052","I must say, Darien certainly has a way with the ladies. That's not how I'd go about extracting information from the enemy, but I can't fault his results.nnThe old smuggler's tunnel should lead into the cityif we can get through it.",""
"55049764-1-8053","Moons' blessings, walker. Have you come to help this one save the camp from unclawed Imperials?",""
"55049764-1-8054","Oh, you again. What do you need?",""
"55049764-1-8055","I hope you didn't travel from far away just to see <<1>>. I am not performing at present.nnMy magic cannot function safely in front of a crowd. The, uh, stars are out of alignment.",""
"55049764-1-8056","Blasted cat-folk. They dine on sweet rolls while we choke down spoiled porridge. nnCan't you hear them? Those hissy laughs of theirs …. It makes me sick. St. Pelin give me temperance.",""
"55049764-1-8057","Forgive me, but I must tend to my flock. <<1>> should be able to answer any questions you have about her carnival.",""
"55049764-1-8058","You reek of kwama juices … why don't you come inside and spend some time with your granny Alyxe? nnI'll have a hearty chunky brain stew ready soon, or do you like it spongey and raw?",""
"55049764-1-8059","I promised to keep my husband in line, and that's just what I'm going to do. If he even goes near something that smells like criminal activity, he'll answer to the business end of my broom!",""
"55049764-1-8060","What do you have there? A book?",""
"55049764-1-8061","It's good to see Baron Alard again. He is like a brother to me. It's been weeks since we last saw each other.nnI only wish this reunion was under better circumstances.",""
"55049764-1-8062","You have a point, my friendperhaps we're all in this together.nnSeems it's the only way we'll get out of this war alive. Uptight as these High Elves are, they did save our skins.",""
"55049764-1-8063","You and that Wood Elf can lie to yourselves, but the Altmer have a place above all others. It's not a judgmentsimply a matter of fact. Our knowledge and contributions to history ensure this.nnThat Wood Elf needs to learn his place.",""
"55049764-1-8064","We're the only survivors? I will always remember how you saved me, my father, and my betrothed.",""
"55049764-1-8067","I have more than a few copies, so keep the book as long as you wish. A shame none of them are the translated versions!",""
"55049764-1-8068","I have begun to wonder whether all scholars are as troublesome as this one.",""
"55049764-1-8069","Have you got everything you need?",""
"55049764-1-8071","I'm not sure I can ever forget what happened to my brothers because of what you did, but … you saved Kaleen. You saved Shornhelm, too. I can't discount that.nnI guess we'll just have to learn to live with each other.",""
"55049764-1-8072","I can't believe this could possibly be taking you so long. How hard could it be?",""
"55049764-1-8073","Ha! You made it! I never doubted for a moment. I mean, sure, when the top of the entire mountain disappears, you don't expect many people to walk away from that. But here you are!",""
"55049764-1-8074","You looking for a mace, or maybe a bow? You know, for hunting, not, like, fighting.nn…Just between you and me, these Imperial skeevers hanging around is killing my business. Nobody wants to be seen arming themselves.",""
"55049764-1-8075","I do not have much to sell, wayfarer. These red-clad brigands took most of my goods as spoils of war. But you are welcome to look over what is left.",""
"55049764-1-8076","Can't talk much. Imperials are always watching. Take my advicebuy some of my expertly crafted armor, then get out of Hallin's Stand altogether.",""
"55049764-1-8077","I can't talk much. Imperials are always watching. Take my advicebuy some of my expertly crafted armor, then get out of Hallin's Stand altogether.",""
"55049764-1-8078","Next time, let's go shopping. Wouldn't that be more fun?",""
"55049764-1-8079","Fancy a good scrap, like I do? You should join the Guild! Go talk to Hlurashe'll help you out.",""
"55049764-1-8080","Bah. So sick of seeing these Imperial bastards strut past the door like they own the place. If someone doesn't start a riot soon, I may have to do it myself.",""
"55049764-1-8081","By the Three, if you slay Daedra half as well as you slay slack-jawed Imperial conscripts you've got a bright future in the Fighters Guild, f'lah.",""
"55049764-1-8082","I won't ask.",""
"55049764-1-8083","I said, go away! Oh … I beg your pardon. I thought you were one of those oafish Imperials looking for another charm potion. As if such a thing would fool a proud daughter of Hammerfell.nnHave you come seeking potions? I offer the best in the city.",""
"55049764-1-8084","You return. Did you have any luck finding the remaining fragments?",""
"55049764-1-8085","Wonderful day for a bloodfiend attack. What can I do for you, citizen?",""
"55049764-1-8086","Thirsty? Ruptga knows those cursed Imperials are. They've nearly drunk me out of a job. Sometimes they even pay. Dogs and sons of dogs, all of them.nnI've managed to hide away some of my better stock, though. Interested?",""
"55049764-1-8087","I didn't do it, whatever it was.",""
"55049764-1-8088","You … are kind to make such an offer, my friend. I actually hurt my sword arm slaying my captors. I could use an ally.nnIf this lot has harmed Esmaeel, I'll bring this cave down around their heads.",""
"55049764-1-8089","Get her out. I'll be right behind you.",""
"55049764-1-8090","Shut the door quickly behind you. The sand gets into everything, especially the alchemical equipment.nnHave you come seeking membership in the Guild?",""
"55049764-1-8091","I knew you'd be back. I also know Naruk is dead. Thank you. Yet again, you've stopped a threat to the city and the Covenant.",""
"55049764-1-8092","This occupation won't last. We Redguards won't labor under an Imperial yokeit's not in our nature. nnTo be honest, I'm surprised the peace has held this long.",""
"55049764-1-8093","I'd stay off the street if I were you. I've seen ill omens in my scrying mirror. nnBlood is going to be spilled here in Hallin's Stand. Very soon.",""
"55049764-1-8094","<Esmaeel lies dead.>",""
"55049764-1-8095","People here just don't understand Khajiit. This one came here to try to build a better life, but now Malira just wants to go back to Khenarthi.",""
"55049764-1-8096","Thanks for putting that cat in her place. Those people can be so stubborn.nnThe Khajiit need to understand that some of their cultural rituals are taboo to the rest of the Dominion. Those of us who are civilized, anyway.",""
"55049764-1-8097","Welcome to The Drowsy Owl, my friend. I would offer you a bed, but the Imperials have soiled them all. What once smelled of jasmine and rose blossoms now smells of boiled meat and dog. Their stench persists despite our efforts.nnMy deepest apologies.",""
"55049764-1-8098","You shouldn't linger, wayfarer. Hallin's Stand is nothing but an Imperial kennel now. I'm bound for the Alik'r as soon as I get the opportunityyou would do well to follow suit.",""
"55049764-1-8099","The shards of my soul are still trapped. Please find them.",""

"55049764-1-8282","Welcome to our humble guildhall, fellow Fighter. How are things out there?nnI'm itching to return to active combat.",""
"55049764-1-8283","I'm not doing anything until that coal fire is started. nnDon't worry, I'll be able to hear the blast from here.",""
"55049764-1-8284","Welcome, Mage. Feel free to make use of our humble facilities here as you will.nnThey are here for Mages Guild use, after all.",""
"55049764-1-8285","Have we met? You seem quite familiar.nnI'm demonstrably busy at the moment. It seems a colleague of mine couldn't avoid a simple spiritual posession on <<1>>. You understand, I'm sure.",""
"55049764-1-8286","It's good to see you. <<1>> has been assisting me with a … certain project. Before long, <<2>> will be free to leave <<3>>.nnSoon, I'm certain of it.",""
"55049764-1-8287","Ah, my friend from <<1>>. Rest assured, we're doing everything in our power to free my apprentice. <<2>> will not hold her for long.nnForgive me, I must return to my calculations. The magic is quite delicate.",""
"55049764-1-8290","I've been supplying the Briars for some time now. But I would be more than happy to take your coin as well.",""
"55049764-1-8292","<<1>> is my husband, and a master hunter. We met each other while stalking the same bear. It was love at first sight!",""
"55049764-1-8293","Good luck in your trials.",""
"55049764-1-8294","Don't ask what happened while you were drunk. It is better not to know.",""
"55049764-1-8296","The Dominion is in need of capable citizens. And by capable, I mean you.",""
"55049764-1-8297","Brendar returned safely thanks to you. I appreciate your kindness and bravery.nnHe's waiting at the Horker's Tusk. I believe he wanted to speak to you.",""
"55049764-1-8298","You made it out. That's good to see. What of the necromancer?",""
"55049764-1-8300","I can't believe that <<1>> is dead. She was a good soldier. And a good woman. She will be missed.",""
"55049764-1-8301","Bring this here, take it there. Half the time, it seems they're moving it just to have it moved!",""
"55049764-1-8302","This one brought his family all the way to <<1>>, expecting a place in our own embassy.nnInstead, we sit in leaky tents waiting for promises to be fulfilled!",""
"55049764-1-8303","They're going to have a feast for us? Is that what she said? I hope they don't serve any harpy meat. I never want to smell that again.",""
"55049764-1-8304","You're back. Need me again?nnI'd like to get out and about. There're too many memories that catch up when I'm not moving.",""
"55049764-1-8305","I have never idled well. I appreciate you bringing this old man along with you.nnIt feels good to put these hands to work.",""
"55049764-1-8306","I must confess. Before you returned, I felt somewhat lost, adrift. Traveling with you gives me purpose again.nnI don't do well while idle, it seems.",""
"55049764-1-8307","You should probably speak to Countess Tamrith. I'm not an official member of this triumvirate.",""
"55049764-1-8308","Every day is an adventure when you're part of the Ravenwatch, yes?",""
"55049764-1-8309","I can't believe this! I should cut my losses with these idiots. Work on my own!",""
"55049764-1-8310","What is going on? Why are the harpies attacking? You look like you can handle yourself, get out there and help.",""
"55049764-1-8311","You've ruined us. We'll have to find a new way to earn a living!",""
"55049764-1-8312","Poor Crestshade! What a disaster!nnI was about to head up to that House Ravenwatch stronghold to find help, but for some reason I can't seem to make my legs carry me up these stairs.",""
"55049764-1-8314","Sithis smiles upon <<1>>. Even so, it would appear he has business elsewhere.nnI overheard Dominion soldiers. They said they captured <<Ac:2>>. A dark day, indeed.",""
"55049764-1-8315","You sure you know where you're going? If you're looking for a shortcut to Shornhelm, I'd look elsewhere.nnI wouldn't walk into these ruins unless I knew what I was getting into.",""
"55049764-1-8316","I'm glad we've had someone like you on our side, from start to finish, if you catch my meaning.",""
"55049764-1-8317","You followed through? Excellent. I worried he'd convince you to set him free, then we'd have had to track down both of you. That would have been unpleasant.nnForget that, though. Can't tell you how glad I am to finally have this bastard in custody.",""
"55049764-1-8318","Go on, then. The bandits could be pulling up camp as we speak. If Gavendien gets away, I'll never forgive myself.",""
"55049764-1-8319","I thought that if we just cooperated with them, everything would work out and no one would be hurt.nnNow I know. I will never bargain with bandits again.",""
"55049764-1-8320","If I was a few years younger, I'd go after Gavendien myself. That rotten coward. Killing an innocent woman. He deserves to die!",""
"55049764-1-8321","It might be best for you to move on to another town. Hoarfrost Downs is nice this time of year, I understand.",""
"55049764-1-8322","No. I'm not coming. No, I'm not. Don't even ask. I'll come back, but only when Gaillard says it's safe. Yes, that's right. Only when Gaillard says.nnGaillard told me to stay right here until then.",""
"55049764-1-8323","I feel terrible. Poor Lauravieve. To die so young and so needlessly. It just isn't right.",""
"55049764-1-8324","Someone needs to find that Gavendien and make him pay!",""
"55049764-1-8325","My mother had a passion for jewels and jewelry, and she built this business from nothing.nnI never thought I'd wind up running it myself. Without her, I'm not sure I have what it takes. I'm going to try though.",""
"55049764-1-8327","Mark my words. No Orc gets by here as long as the King's Guard still stands.",""
"55049764-1-8328","I don't see anyone from the Ring of Daggers. Does that mean … you've chosen to let me go free?",""
"55049764-1-8330","It's hard for me to relate to someone like Julien. The young men in my home town never even noticed me. I tried to get their attention by challenging them to duels. But when I beat them, that just made it worse.nnSo I joined the Shornhelm Guard.",""
"55049764-1-8332","Do your worst, lackey to a foreign crown! I won't tell you anything!",""
"55049764-1-8333","At the moment, we're still trapped beneath Lleraya's veil. See if you can find another tear in the spell so that we can leave this place.nnI just hope the book is still with us when the illusion dissipates.",""
"55049764-1-8336","Remember, I'd like to save Northpoint while causing as little death and destruction as possibleexcept for the Montclairs. Kill as many of them as you like.nnJust remind Skordo that this is our city we'll be assailing, not some bandit stronghold.",""
"55049764-1-8337","I am praying for strength and courage. I should not be hiding from those foul creatures. But Arkay bless me, they make my skin crawl.",""
"55049764-1-8338","Good luck. Did I mention there's trolls around there? Frankly, they are worse than ghosts. Meaner and they small really bad.",""
"55049764-1-8340","Darien can't talk right now. I gave him something to relieve his pain. And to quiet him down for a little while.nnThe man does love the sound of his own voice.",""
"55049764-1-8341","I'll give the signal. It's time to liberate Northpoint from these monsters.nnMeanwhile, go to my manor and evict Montclair's daughter from the premiseswith extreme prejudice.",""
"55049764-1-8342","You may not believe this, but that wasn't how I wanted our reunion to play out. But laws were broken. People died. I can't ignore our laws.nnNot even to save my son.",""
"55049764-1-8343","Do you believe that man? And to think, I thought him to be dashing and heroic! But enough of such matters. You aren't here to discuss my personal life.nnTell me, what news from Count Ravenwatch? Are we ready to march against Montclair?",""
"55049764-1-8345","Rivenspire needs Tamrith and Dorell. They cannot be allowed to perish here.nnI need to help get them to safety before I join you up above.",""
"55049764-1-8346","And so everything returns to the way it should be, yes? Only I think the Baroness will be a little less quick to follow in her mother-in-law's footsteps, from now on.",""
"55049764-1-8347","Federic and <<1>> have both left. Perhaps I should leave, as well. Perhaps the Mages Guild has a place for me.",""
"55049764-1-8348","Thank you again, for convincing me to stay. With Federic leaving to join the Covenant, the Edralds will need me more than ever.nnAnd … it is good to see Arlie safe and sound.",""
"55049764-1-8349","Such an awful place. I could have lived my entire life without knowing of such things.",""
"55049764-1-8350","I am sorry to see <<1>> go, but it really is for the best. Soon my Arlie will be happily married, and we can all get on with our lives!",""
"55049764-1-8351","How vile! Is that a piece of Goveled's brain on your boot? What are you? Some kind of monster?nnOnly joking around, of course. You beat him, huh? I'm impressed.",""
"55049764-1-8352","There you are! I've been looking all over for you.nnVerandis requests your presence at the ruins in the Lorkrata Hills, if you aren't too terribly busy at the moment.",""
"55049764-1-8353","I don't know if I'll ever get used to traveling by portal. One moment you're there, the next moment you're here. It's positively disconcerting!",""
"55049764-1-8354","Doubt is insidious. It clouds the mind, makes it hard to think. And what I need, now, is to be thinking clearly!",""
"55049764-1-8356","It's an honor to see you again, my friend. May the gods bless you for all of your days!",""
"55049764-1-8357","Be at ease, friend. You may come anew to the race, just as the spring rains come anew after the winter's snow.nnI will review the rules with you again just to be sure that all is clear.",""
"55049764-1-8359","I don't think there's anything more for us to talk about.",""
"55049764-1-8360","Rohlbert is so brave, acting through hired assassins and spies. Let's see how brave he is when Adusa and Five-Claws come to call!",""
"55049764-1-8362","I hope my daughter finds a way to be happy. I know Federic cares for her, but I'm just not sure he'll satisfy her … more adventurous desires.",""
"55049764-1-8364","Don't worry. I'm keeping a tight watch on her. No more odd behavior. She promised! And I intend to hold her to that.",""
"55049764-1-8365","I will never be able to adequately apologize for everything that happened at the estate. But I am very appreciative that you supported our love.",""
"55049764-1-8366","Dulkhi and I will never forget what you did for us. We've never been more in love!",""
"55049764-1-8367","Verandis … why did it have to be you? Damn you, Verandis! Why didn't you tell me what you planned to do?",""
"55049764-1-8368","This must have been a room for prayer or peaceful contemplation when the Ayleids were alive.",""
"55049764-1-8369","The stars have accepted you. I just hope it is not too late.nnVolumes of prophecy have been written about the stars, but not even the oracles foresaw these events.",""
"55049764-1-8370","I'm just so happy …  I can't stop crying.",""
"55049764-1-8371","Let me take a look at you. So you're the one who dispatched my father's pet Argonian? Well done, by the way. Well done.nnI'm so glad you're here. I was becoming dreadfully bored with Ellic and the rest of these silly nobles.",""
"55049764-1-8372","This chamber has a calming effect. I wonder if this was where the pilgrims rested on their way to visit the uppermost chamber?",""
"55049764-1-8373","I can't tell you how much I appreciate you convincing me to enlist. I've come to realize that this is what I was born to bea soldier.nnNot only have I been able to better support my family, but I like to think I've made them proud, too.",""
"55049764-1-8374","Well, we're here all right, but I'm not sure I'm going to be getting off the boat. In fact, I say we just put right back out to sea.",""
"55049764-1-8375","A finer group of soldiers never served in the Shornhelm Guard. Julien and Shuga have both turned out to be valiant warriors.nnAnd Martin's distinguished himself, too. I actually think he's got the makings of a strong leader.",""
"55049764-1-8376","Ah! You're one who killed that old skeever Dark Elf I was seeing! What was his name again …?nnNo matter. I owe you, though. This soldier business is a lot more fun than being a bandit!",""
"55049764-1-8377","If it isn't Mara's messenger in the flesh! You really saved my love-life. Looking back, I can't imagine what I ever saw in Guendeline. nnI finally met my true love during training. Shuga. She's sweet and strong and all the woman I'll ever need.",""
"55049764-1-8378","That old Khajiit lady in the wagon read my palm and told me that is where I needed to be for my luck to change.nnI'm staying right here until it does.",""
"55049764-1-8380","With all the trouble brewing outside these walls, I'm expecting a lot of orders for weapons soon. Unfortunately, I'm already overtaxed. We haven't had any steel shipments arrive in ages.nnI suppose we have to take the bad with the good.",""
"55049764-1-8383","There are things in these signs I don't understand. When you return, perhaps their meaning will become clearer to me.",""
"55049764-1-8384","I'm afraid the situation in Craglorn grows worse daily. We need every strong sword arm and spellcaster we can recruit.",""
"55049764-1-8385","I didn't put any stock in the words of those Star-Gazers until I saw my first sand giant. It cut a horse in half. I haven't run so fast since I was stealing meat on the streets of Riften.nnNow we're all listening a bit more closely.",""
"55049764-1-8386","Many Dwarven religious texts refer to a Dwemer site called Mtharnaz. A high priest named Arnming wrote that he wished to be buried there, ""among the masters of the heavenly stone.""nnHis burial site is our best chance of finding a Skystone amulet.",""
"55049764-1-8387","Be wary. This area is crawling with Worm Cultists. We learned that the hard way when they ambushed us down in the cavern.nnGods only know what they're doing down there, but we can't complete our mission.",""
"55049764-1-8388","We are near Fallowstone Hall, hallowed home of the Companions. I would show you around, but this is not your place.",""
"55049764-1-8389","I came up wth the name Outside Inn, because we're just outside of the Elden Root. Get it? Outside… Inn?  I'm pretty clever that way!",""
"55049764-1-8390","Now that the city is safe and those Montclair miscreants have been banished, I think I'll just sit here for awhile and soak up the ambiance.",""
"55049764-1-8391","Well, at least Shornhelm is safe. For now. But I can't stand the way Baron Dorell and Countess Tamrith bicker. And in public, even!nnI wonder when the two of them will decide to settle their differences by the sword?",""
"55049764-1-8392","The High King gave the crown of Shornhelm to Baron Dorell. I mean, King Alard. That's what we call him now. And he looks so handsome in his regal garb!",""
"55049764-1-8393","The High King crowned the Countess! Excuse me, Queen Eselde. That's what we call her now. And she looks beautiful in her regal garb!",""
"55049764-1-8394","I heard we have a queen now. I wonder if things will really get any better.",""
"55049764-1-8395","So the High King gave the crown to Countess Tamrith. Well, that figures! He always had a soft spot for beautiful Eselde.",""
"55049764-1-8396","Welcome to the Shornhelm Mages Guild Hall. Do I detect a budding acolyte in our midst?",""
"55049764-1-8397","Thank the Lord, Mother, and Wizard. You're back! nnPlease tell me you've got good news.",""
"55049764-1-8398","Ahh, you're back. Sorry about earlier. I'm feeling better already.nnWhat news from the spider hole?",""
"55049764-1-8399","Ah, you're back. Do you have my goods?",""
"55049764-1-8400","Greetings, traveler. You'll go no further up the river here, I'm afraid. A mystical ward bars the path up to Tormented Spire. An unstable ward, at that.",""
"55049764-1-8401","Good luck. Kyne speed you on your way.",""
"55049764-1-8402","Pardon me; I'm seeking a group that will offer me protection on my trip.nnI'm a researcher of sorts, seeking out the secrets of Craglorn! But I can't do it all by myself. If you haven't noticed, things haven't been friendly as of late.",""
"55049764-1-8403","We can handle ourselves for now, but I don't know how long we can keep this up.nnSee what they need at Vivec's Antlers first. That's the higher priority right now.",""
"55049764-1-8404","Covenant soldiers everywhere. Like an infestation of nasty, stinging mudcrabs. Bah.",""
"55049764-1-8405","Hello, friend.",""
"55049764-1-8406","Report in, soldier. What brings you to Vivec's Antlers?",""
"55049764-1-8407","You arrive alone. Either you didn't find him, or I need a new hunting partner.",""
"55049764-1-8409","My friend! How good to see you again! Did you give the Hagraven a proper thrashing? And did you happen to find my wife's mace?nnTell me all is well and we'll drink to our good fortune!",""
"55049764-1-8410","Thank you for returning my mace. My husband always loses things, and he refuses to put on a decent pair of shoes, but I do love him so.nnAs soon as he's sober, though, we're going to have a talk about why I remind him of a Hagraven.",""
"55049764-1-8412","You found my cat!",""
"55049764-1-8417","Let's look around the perimeter of the camp. The remains of the last soldier must be around there somewhere.",""
"55049764-1-8418","You should be able to find <<1>> toward the front of the camp. That's where I saw him last.",""
"55049764-1-8420","We've been in Stormhaven fighting the Ironhand Ogres for too long. We've got soldiers stationed here, Wayrest … all across eastern Stormhaven, really.nnWe need to do our duty for the Covenant, but at some point, we need to go home to Wrothgar.",""
"55049764-1-8421","You don't look like someone who's just wandering by. Please tell me you have word from General Godrun or someone over at Shinji's Scarp.nnPlease tell me they're finally sending orders for us to rejoin the main army.",""
"55049764-1-8422","I know that look, friend. Is the task complete? Are Lleraya's remaining vampires destroyed?",""
"55049764-1-8424","I feel better already. Just knowing that I reached out to Azura. I know my father would be pleased as well.",""
"55049764-1-8425","These are dark times, my friend. I only pray that Azura can speed the dawn of brighter days to come.",""
"55049764-1-8427","Remember to bring any messages you find to Captain Gilame up near the tower.",""
"55049764-1-8428","This is a bad time for Kragenmoor, traveler. Are you here on business? If not, you'd best be moving along.",""
"55049764-1-8429","You saved me, and helped free my father's city. I have no doubt you'll put a stop to this madness.",""
"55049764-1-8430","Thrice-blasted nobles! Their coffers keep the kingdom running, but at the first sign of trouble ….",""
"55049764-1-8432","Welcome to Hoarfrost Downs, perhaps the dreariest hamlet in all of Rivenspire. Actually, the entire kingdom is rather dreary, isn't it? nnWhat can I do for you? Have you come to join the Mages Guild?",""
"55049764-1-8433","Hail, comrade. You'll have to pardon my appearance. Tangled with a Clannfear recently and this Coldharbour muck stains worse than the snowberry wine.",""
"55049764-1-8435","Baron Dorell sends us out here to get the drop on Montclair, and what happens? The fiend turns half of Northpoint into gibbering monsters and we're stuck waiting for orders!",""
"55049764-1-8446","Fenila's words are incorrect, Lord Vivec, though she clearly believes them. I haven't contacted Belronen for months, and would never have done so without your direction.nnWealth has no meaning next to serving you, my lord. This you know to be true.",""
"55049764-1-8447","Lord Vivec, Vamen should be dead on the floor. Belronen wouldn't share the note that temple netch sent his way, but assured me its contents were vile.nnOne sworn to the temple, quibbling over coin? You should kill him yourself. My lord.",""
"55049764-1-8448","A tragedy, Lord Vivec. Belronen's death in the temple brings great shame to his house. I had thought reasoned words could dissuade him from the duel.nnSuch temper is common to House Telvanni. But it's not my place to question their reliability.",""
"55049764-1-8450","The Wilderking's reign draws to an end. The forest spirits have gone mad, even my own brethren … and he is powerless to stop them. nnIntruders enter Greenheartdark and conflicted soulsthey are the harbingers of the Wilderking's death.",""
"55049764-1-8451","Don't tell the Commander who sent you to him. His mood's been an icy squall since Thod failed to report in this morning. The last thing I need is him taking it out on me.",""
"55049764-1-8452","Don't you worry. We'll see those reserves are sent. In the meantime, I have a favor to ask. I have a missive that must reach Vulkhel Guard.",""
"55049764-1-8454","Enjoy the pomp and circumstance, friend. I'll keep the mugs warm for the royals. Heh.",""
"55049764-1-8455","Is my brother ready? I need to get him out of here.",""

"55049764-1-8472","You provide a welcome distraction, friend. The thought of those Jackdaw brutes muddying my floors and soiling my instruments is too much to bear.",""

"55049764-1-8539","I recognize you. You were talking with Urcelmo in the courtyard earlier. I heard about what happened with Astanya … most of us aren't like that. Will you spare a moment for the true Vulkhel Watch?",""
"55049764-1-8540","Thank the Stars. This mudcrab won't stop pinching me. nnListen, you have to get to Silsailen! Help them before it's too late.",""
"55049764-1-8541","They've burned the town! Please, please help us!",""

"55049764-1-8545","I just arrived from Deshaan. Dethisam sent me. Perhaps you've heard of him? He's the consul for the town of Serkamorathe Serk.nnI'm here to spread the word and warn people about the Llodos plague.",""

"55049764-1-8554","Light the four keyflames to unseal the pathway into the underground. Once there, deal with as many of the escaping monsters as you can. There's no telling what could be down there, but I think it's safe to say it's a threat to us all if set loose.",""
"55049764-1-8555","Thank you for talking to me. Auri-El only knows what I've had to put up with out here. That old goat won't listen to a word I say!",""

"55049764-1-8572","Ah, you're back! Don't look so gloomy. At least you made it back to fight another day.nnMy allies weren't so lucky. Well? You're breathing, aren't you? Get back out there!",""
"55049764-1-8573","Who are you? How have you come to avenge us? You will find few allies here.nnAbelazar the betrayer has turned all of the Sword-Disciples into thralls. He would have turned me as well, if I had been less of a coward.",""
"55049764-1-8576","So it is true then? Prince Naemon has been raised from the dead and now seeks vengeance by corrupting Valenwood?nnGods help us! That makes this even more difficult. And with the undead already outside the city gates, we must act now.",""

"55049764-1-8604","Divines bless you, friend! World's a hard place, these days. My eleven children will surely starve today without a morsel to eat.nnWon't you spare some gold for an honest man and his poor children?",""
"55049764-1-8605","Five … no, ten! Ten bandits beat me and made off with my belongings! All they left were these rags you see before you. The pain! It is without ending!",""

"55049764-1-8615","None of these pirates want to join the Fighters Guild. I tried telling them Daedra could be found on the seas, but that just made them nervous.",""
"55049764-1-8616","Did my brother send you? I've been expecting a shipment for more than a week now.",""

"55049764-1-8620","Ah! So he did find you? That's good. The Ebonheart Pact needs a hero here. King Jorunn needs a hero here.nnThe Worm Cult's leaderThallik Wormfatherhe's a sneaky one, and very dangerous. Whatever he's planning, he must be stopped.",""
"55049764-1-8621","At this point, I'm not looking for a cure. These waters make you insane. Muttering this ""Shada this"" and ""Shada that"" nonsense. Not to mention trying to rip out your throat.nnDo what you have to do and just get any survivors out of there.",""

"55049764-1-8640","You have done what the Yokudans could not. You have slain Zal'ik. You have given me my freedom.nnAnd yet, forgive me if I feel no joy. Zal'ik was a brave man. He only wanted to save his people.",""

"55049764-1-8650","Strange. I've seen these ruins jutting from the waters before. They always seemed so … ordinary. nnBut now they're practically humming with energy. And I sense … what is that … my gods, yes! It's some kind of entrance.",""
"55049764-1-8651","It looks a hopeless task to me, but something makes me want to believe Hara would not have sent us here if she wasn't sure we could find whatever it is she needs us to see.",""

"55049764-1-8721","You… you made it back! Oh, I'm so relieved. Thank you for checking in. Danni will want to talk with you, but I'm glad to see you're okay.",""
"55049764-1-8722","We've not had visitors to the Aetherian Archive in a long time. You should know that you pose a risk to yourself by stepping outside this chamber.nnThe Learned One does not want outsiders on the upper floors. I would not test her.",""
"55049764-1-8723","Thanks for talking me out anything stupid, rook. I needed to vent my frustrations. Now, let's go steal a ship.",""
"55049764-1-8724","Without Hara, I fear we will all be swallowed by the darkness. Please help her.",""
"55049764-1-8725","I just heard what happened to Hara. What could this mean? Could it be that the Scaled Court has agents even among the Star-Gazers?",""
"55049764-1-8728","This one would not go near the Citadel again for all the Moon Sugar in Tamriel.nnActually, that's not true.",""
"55049764-1-8729","So you plan on approaching that Citadel, eh? You look like you can take care of yourself, but I'm telling youno one who's stepped out there has returned, be they scholar, merchant, or warrior.nnIt's your life.",""
"55049764-1-8730","You … you plan to venture within?nnI do not possess your bravery, but pleasemany of my friends, scholars, drivers of the caravans, have gone inside and not returned. Help them if you still can.",""
"55049764-1-8733","Glad you could meet me. The boat's all ready. I' just need to hear the word.",""
"55049764-1-8734","You're here. Good. Are you ready to go?",""
"55049764-1-8735","Hello there.",""
"55049764-1-8736","My friend, you're victorious!nnI hope Hel Ra Citadel was fierce enough for you!",""
"55049764-1-8737","Move along, please.",""
"55049764-1-8738","Grab that Eyes of the Queen disguise. It's our best protection while we infiltrate this place. I shall play the part of the gruff and lowly prisoner.",""
"55049764-1-8739","Make sure you take that Eyes of the Queen disguise. We'll need it for getting inside. Let's just hope we can fool the guards long enough to get Gwenneth.",""
"55049764-1-8740","Grab that disguise before we go in. We need it to get past the guards here. I don't know if it'll fool them for very long, but it's the best chance we've got.",""
"55049764-1-8741","HelloEnjoy your stay at Xarxes' Rebuke.",""
"55049764-1-8742","Kidnap me, will they? Ugh. This is such a waste.",""
"55049764-1-8743","Don't kill me! Please! I didn't kill the master!",""
"55049764-1-8744","The ship's new crew will work out. And if they don't, the captain will send them off to the old mutineers.",""
"55049764-1-8745","What are you talking to me for? You have a course to run. Follow the markers until you reach the end! Talaya will record your time when you're done.",""
"55049764-1-8746","It is good to see you up and about. I credit <<1>>'s sweet sea breezes with your recovery!",""
"55049764-1-8748","You are a good rider. This one will have to work harder to bring you a real challenge.",""
"55049764-1-8749","I had a horse. It threw me near Westry. I have not seen it since. But I will get another one, and it will not throw me, and I will prove myself.",""
"55049764-1-8750","Leave an old man be!",""
"55049764-1-8751","Rana's waiting for you in the village. Go on. She doesn't bite, though she looks like she might.",""
"55049764-1-8752","Stay back! If the guards see us speak, they'll beat us both!",""
"55049764-1-8753","Do not worry, my friend. The poison will do no lasting harm.nnTo her, I mean. She will need to burn her bedsheets.",""
"55049764-1-8754","Welcome to my humble home. What can Magistrate Banu do for you today?",""
"55049764-1-8755","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8756","This is Ahmat's childhood home, he says. If this one was a child here, this one would have run away from home.",""
"55049764-1-8757","When my horse is watered, I will try the race again. My dear mother did not raise me to give up at the first sign of trouble.",""
"55049764-1-8758","Good! What are you waiting for? Get going! Follow the markers until you reach the end.",""
"55049764-1-8759","If you see the queen, tell her where to find us. Tell her that Talaya has designed a challenge just for her, yes?nnThis one would be deeply honored to have her run the course.",""
"55049764-1-8760","These milk-drinkers and their skinny little steeds … I will show them how to ride a horse! As soon as I get a new mount, that is. nnMy mare was eating the colorful leaves, but they were apparently poisonous. No matter, I will find another!",""
"55049764-1-8761","It is dark place in which we meet today, my friend. I am sorry that you are here. I am sorry that I am here.nnBut if we are going to be stuck here, then we shall at least have a riding course!",""
"55049764-1-8762","Talaya needs to find that Cadwell. That old bastard better have some ideas for how to make the course more difficult.",""
"55049764-1-8763","If I am truly going to be stuck here for all eternity, maybe it's time I find something better to do. nnTo be honest, I never really liked Ahmat. At least once, you would think that stupid milk-drinker would have let me borrow his horse!",""
"55049764-1-8764","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8765","Talaya hopes to see you again. Next time, perhaps she can build a course that you will not complete so easily!",""
"55049764-1-8766","Riding horses is in my nature. You can ask anyone in these parts. nnI was born on horseback. Literally. My mother was fleeing the Reachmen, and I just popped outright there on the rump of my father's prize-stallion. It's a shame that horse died.",""
"55049764-1-8767","It's not fair! I finally saved up enough gold to buy a new horse and then, before I even get to ride it, some skinny little Bosmer sneaks up and steals it!nnI'll find him somehow, even if I have to tear this forest apart!",""
"55049764-1-8768","This is fine. Talaya will simply have to redouble her efforts. She will make the course harder, yes?nnPerhaps … more roots? And maybe some hoarvoars ….",""
"55049764-1-8769","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8770","As much as I love to ride horses, I would not do it here. nnMy legs are so sweaty from this heat and humidity, I fear I would just slide right out of the saddle!",""
"55049764-1-8771","Go on now. You must find another of our courses. Surely, there will be one you cannot complete so easily.",""
"55049764-1-8772","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8773","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8774","You just wait. Talaya is no mewling, dull-clawed kitten. You want a hard course, this one will give it to you!",""
"55049764-1-8776","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8777","Go on now. Talaya needs to retrace the course. She will figure out your trick, and she will amend the course so that others cannot complete it so easily.",""
"55049764-1-8778","Where is that Baandari? She promised me the fastest horse this side of Cyrodiil. I gave her the gold, now she had better deliver!",""
"55049764-1-8779","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8780","Be on your way now. Talaya has already acknowledged your success. You do not need to remain here and tickle this one's whiskers.",""
"55049764-1-8781","This isn't fair! I paid a traveling a merchant a king's ransom to bring me a stallion from the Alik'r desert, and do you know what happened? Do you know?nnThe horse froze to death the night he arrived! I tell you, I am beginning to think I am cursed.",""
"55049764-1-8782","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8783","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8784","Every time you beat one of Talaya's courses, you challenge her to do better.nnIt is good to have a nemesis!",""
"55049764-1-8785","I was knocked off my horse and when I came to, it was gone.",""
"55049764-1-8786","This one wonders if she could make a course that runs through Oblivion ….",""
"55049764-1-8787","Another course, another lost horse. It seems my luck has not changed.",""
"55049764-1-8788","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8789","This one will be glad to be out of Rivenspire. Bloodfiends bite more than Talaya's little cousins.",""
"55049764-1-8790","Yes, I think I'm just about ready. Just give me a few more minutes here. I'm confident I will succeed.",""
"55049764-1-8791","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8792","This one does not mean to complain. Talaya loves her work, she really does. But she prefers dry ground.",""
"55049764-1-8793","I'm thinking of hiring an Argonian guide to ride along with me. Maybe then things will go my way. nnOr not. Probably, he'll just rob me and leave for dead in the murk.",""
"55049764-1-8794","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8795","You are a skilled rider. Talaya will have to be craftier to trick you.",""
"55049764-1-8796","I have wanted to be a Black Horse Courier since I was a young boy. It was a courier who brought news of the invaders who sacked my home. That man saved our lives.",""
"55049764-1-8797","I don't care to sail through corpses. But if I dock at Mistral, they'll inspect my cargo!nnWhich is all legitimate, I assure you.",""
"55049764-1-8798","Hm. It seems you did not complete the course. That's no reason to give up, however! Would you like to try again?",""
"55049764-1-8799","Oh the pockets this one picked with her father showing her the way. Such fine memories!",""
"55049764-1-8800","I was the fastest rider in my village. As long as the finish line was less than a league away. The truth is, I'm more of a sprinter.",""
"55049764-1-8803","This is too convenient. A token, so you can be brought in? How did she know this would happen?nnSomething's awry. Danni knows more than I think she should.",""
"55049764-1-8804","Welcome! I take it you were brought here by one of our Guides.nnAre you to be our new initiate?",""
"55049764-1-8805","Please tell me we're ready to go, or that I can stop holding back on this delicious ale.",""
"55049764-1-8806","You missed my big performance! I was hoping you'd be here in time to watch. It was a great time.nnGot to peek in lots of windows.",""
"55049764-1-8807","Glad you could make it. I've been listening in to some conversations, and having a few of my own.",""
"55049764-1-8808","Thanks to you, the Thieves Guild is a success.",""
"55049764-1-8809","Hope to see you for the next big heist.",""
"55049764-1-8810","Now I wonder what will be next on the list.",""
"55049764-1-8811","I hope Danni has something amazing up her sleeve still left.",""
"55049764-1-8812","After you.",""
"55049764-1-8813","You're mising out on the instructions! Don't blame me should something go wrong.",""
"55049764-1-8815","Satakal's vengeance must be quick as a serpent's strike. You'll find my traitorous acolytes at Scaled Court enclaves throughout the region.",""
"55049764-1-8816","The Moons are pleased, walker. Very pleased.",""
"55049764-1-8817","Heading to Abah's Landing? I'm the captain you want to talk to.",""
"55049764-1-8818","Heading to Abah's Landing? I sail there quite regularly if you need a lift.",""
"55049764-1-8819","Abah's Landing by starlight. Have you ever seen such a gem of a city? I can take you there, if you wish it.",""
"55049764-1-8820","Any news about our missing guards? We're counting on you to see this through for us.",""
"55049764-1-8823","That look on your face. You look like you've been beaten. They beat me, tooI didn't let it bother me … by the Moons this hurts.nnYou're alive, aren't you? Get back in there!",""
"55049764-1-8825","Listen to me, my friend. We have a problem.",""
"55049764-1-8826","What're you doing down here? Flee, you fool! The Serpent is here, and his Scaled Court runs rampant through these caverns!",""
"55049764-1-8827","You'd best turn around, stranger. The Star-Gazers had reason to suspect Scaled Court activity in these caves, but it's not just the Courtthe Celestial Serpent is here! nnHe has plans for Craglorn. For all of Tamriel.",""
"55049764-1-8828","What do you want? Have you fools come to your senses? Ready to set me free?nnThe master will do it himself after he peels the skin off you! He will not suffer a member of his Court humiliated like this! I will not suffer it!",""
"55049764-1-8829","Little goat is still here? Why? Little goat has work to do! Don't come back until the task is done!",""
"55049764-1-8830","Don't worry. You have the Listener's favor at least.",""
"55049764-1-8831","I knew there was wisdom in you. You'll still need to report to the Listener, but I'm sure the Keeper will wish to speak to you about your actions here today.",""
"55049764-1-8832","I see you've returned from the mission I assigned you.",""
"55049764-1-8834","Make her pay.",""
"55049764-1-8835","I barely know her, yet she claims I ruined her life. And now my life lies in your hands. I'm begging you to reconsider. Take my offer and the Dark Brotherhood will have me as a loyal client.",""
"55049764-1-8836","Travys is a good  man. Been looking our for Lady Margrette and her family since she was a little girl.",""
"55049764-1-8837","Now let's see. Maybe if I get him something he doesn't like, he'll be more likely to  make a decision next time.",""
"55049764-1-8838","I'm serious about that offer. Can't say we get many that look quite as … capable as yourself.",""
"55049764-1-8839","I can't wait for tonight. It's going to be lovely.",""
"55049764-1-8840","I wouldn't go tellin' people that we spoke here.",""
"55049764-1-8841","Remember to let me know if you see her!",""
"55049764-1-8842","I'm telling you, her safety is all a facade. Travys knows. He just can't get the people good enough to hire for these posts.",""
"55049764-1-8843","'Bout time to call it quits, I think.",""
"55049764-1-8844","If anyone asks, we never spoke.",""
"55049764-1-8845","It looks like things went well. Where to now?",""
"55049764-1-8846","Hi! Lovely day to be in prison, isn't it? Can you be a dear and undo those locks for me, please? That would be very lovely of you.",""
"55049764-1-8847","You've been gone for some time. How'd it go?",""
"55049764-1-8848","Is the Covenant on our side or the Daedras'? Kill me or free me, but decide quickly.",""
"55049764-1-8849","Oh please, please don't kill me!",""
"55049764-1-8851","Welcome to the fortress of the so-called Free Legion. Per the Keeper's instructions, everyone here dies.nnAre you ready? You've got the first task.",""
"55049764-1-8852","Head inside, find Marganus. Let's see what you can do.",""
"55049764-1-8853","Did you come looking for the Scaled Court, too? Looks like the bastards have no shortage of enemies.nnYou have that look in your eye. If you're planning on going into these caves, you'll need equipment. Just so happens I have some I could sell you.",""
"55049764-1-8854","This place is fascinating, isn't it? As naturally beautiful as the cultists inside are deranged.nnSaywhile I have you here, how about you take a look at my wares?",""
"55049764-1-8855","Talk to Bronric. He'll take you to the Free Legion's Redoubt.",""
"55049764-1-8857","Now that it's been announced, We need to act fast. No one here is going to make any changes until they see the Wrath of Sithis is real. I'm sending you after the biggest violators we have.",""
"55049764-1-8858","Looking for the Listener?",""
"55049764-1-8859","Wonder where you've been all this time.",""
"55049764-1-8860","The Wrath of Sithis. That sounds … amazing.",""
"55049764-1-8862","Hurry! Up the hill! He's feeding my companions to the trolls!",""
"55049764-1-8863","I've heard of this ""Captain Ann."" Bah!",""
"55049764-1-8864","Ann's a jerk!",""
"55049764-1-8868","Considering I've lost two of my best, I'm turning to you for this latest contract. It's somewhat sensative, but I trust you'll handle it like the professional you are.",""
"55049764-1-8871","I'm going to keep working here. If Adreso is your target, you'll find him in the manor house.",""
"55049764-1-8872","Thanks to the bravery of people such as you, we scholars can do our own part to make the world a better place.nnI need to return to Dragonstar. My companions need to know what's happening here. When you find the Scaled Court, show them no mercy.",""
"55049764-1-8873","Do you approach us with darkest joy in your heart? Is the deed done?",""
"55049764-1-8874","Did it succeed? Do not lie to me. I do not respond well to deceit.",""
"55049764-1-8875","This is a very high level contract. I'm trusting you to see it through. Are you ready?",""
"55049764-1-8876","You're going into the Valley of Scars? You're certainly braver than I am.",""
"55049764-1-8877","What's the contract today?",""
"55049764-1-8878","Good luck, and may Tall Papa bring you and our friends back safely.",""
"55049764-1-8879","I wish I was healthy enough to go with you. Just promise you'll bring my Camaarie back to me in one piece.",""
"55049764-1-8880","Hope the Jarl gave you a good warm up. You're going to need it for this run.",""
"55049764-1-8881","Remember. Don't stop for anything. Run straight to the shoreline where Bronric dropped you off.",""
"55049764-1-8882","If you get a chance, make those Iron Orcs pay for what they did to us. A little blood for blood, know what I mean? It's only fair.",""
"55049764-1-8883","Heed me, Wrath of Sithis.",""
"55049764-1-8885","I thought I saw Veesk's techniques in all this. She does exceptional work!nnJust be careful. The mantikoras I've encountered are deadly enough. I can't imagine what this progenitor can do.",""
"55049764-1-8888","You've got quite a bundle there. Did you find our caches?",""
"55049764-1-8889","Thank you for untying me. I'll get out of here as quickly as I can!",""
"55049764-1-8890","You're one of those who fought the Scaled Court? Beat back the Iron Orcs? Thanks for that, I guess.nnNow if you only could do something about those Dragonstar Caravan Company criminals ….",""
"55049764-1-8895","We were fortunate you arrived when you did. Nerien'eth single-handedly trounced the lot of us, even as we were fully prepared to face him.nnYou must be formidable indeed.",""
"55049764-1-8896","The Listener has been blessed with the silence of the Void.nnYou will enjoy a different form of silence, soon. I have a final task for you.",""
"55049764-1-8897","Varn seems to have come into her own. She's asked me to be her Keeper, which I can do.nnThis all seems… fitting, like it was meant to be. We have a lot to do, but I feel more grounded, now.",""
"55049764-1-8898","It wants to know of Oosh? She is colder, sharper, like a well-honed blade.nnThe scales suit her well. I approve.",""
"55049764-1-8899","We're getting sicker by the minute. Please, hurry!",""
"55049764-1-8900","This is a private matter, and your presence draws attention. I do not require the Wrath of Sithis to escort me beyond our sanctuary.nnBut that's not it, is it? Why are you here?",""
"55049764-1-8901","Hey there! Bad news, my friend. Norion is plugged tighter than an Elf with his holes melted shut.nnBut when everything's bottled up, the trick is to seal yourself inside.",""
"55049764-1-8902","I hate funerals. The best part happens before I arrive.nnBut it doesn't care. Tell me, has it found the meat?",""
"55049764-1-8903","You need to finish up that contract. The guests were giving me funny looks. You don't think it's the axe, do you?",""
"55049764-1-8904","What a terrible day. Such a tragedy. Et cetera, et cetera.",""
"55049764-1-8906","Where is that imbescile?",""
"55049764-1-8908","Yes? Is there something you need?",""
"55049764-1-8911","Gods, I need a drink. Maybe five. I can't face Norion like this.",""
"55049764-1-8912","We gave everything to defeat Nerien'eth. And were it not for the kindness of a stranger, we would be at his mercyagain. You have my thanks, friend.nnAt least the day is won.",""
"55049764-1-8913","The Scaled Court seems to have lost the will to fight. I hear we have you to thank for that. nnAll of Dragonstar is in your debt.",""
"55049764-1-8915","The hero of Skyreach! And not a moment too soon. I was this close to taking a job as a carpenter, and I hate wood. It's full of splintersand squirrels! Tree skeevers, I call them. nnSorry, I'm rambling. But at least the mine is back in business.",""
"55049764-1-8918","Now that all that business with the wild serpent is over, maybe we can get back to the real issue at hand. This town is woefully lacking a proper brewer.",""
"55049764-1-8919","So that mantikora monster was real? Huh. Maybe I should try to find the wish-granting mammoth those Nord gladiators told me about.",""

"55049764-2-3290","Slowly, by divine grace, my powers return. nnSoon I shall once again be ready to contend with Molag Bal's monstrosities.",""
"55049764-2-3291","Where's <<1>>? Did you find him?",""
"55049764-2-3292","I'm glad you're back. Your presence seems to distract the Daedra quite intensely. Maybe now I can determine where my summoning ritual went awry.",""
"55049764-2-3293","Damned foreigners. We've had nothing but trouble ever since the duke married King Fahara'jad's daughter.nnAnd now they bring an army to our doorstep and expect the Knights of the Flame to just stand aside?",""
"55049764-2-3294","How goes the search? Have you discovered anything yet?",""
"55049764-2-3302","Giddy will feast for a moon's turn. Praise <<1>>!",""
"55049764-2-3303","If you die in this endeavor, we will not weep. Not for an outsider.nnSucceed, though, and my tribe will welcome you as clanfriend.",""
"55049764-2-3305","I can't believe my suspicions were so far from the truth. The assassin being a Breton only makes this situation more volatile.nnPlease, tell Sir Hughes and ask him to resolve this matter swiftly.",""
"55049764-2-3306","I wouldn't go up there, if I were you.nnThe entire farm's been burned down. Scamps are everywhere, and Mister Nurin, he's gone missing!",""
"55049764-2-3307","I never imagined that getting locked in the stocks could be this painful.nnI hope you haven't forgotten about me.",""
"55049764-2-3308","I spoke to Sal, but I couldn't reason with him.nnHe refuses to let Dabienne go until <<1>> is back in Koeglin Village, safe and sound.",""
"55049764-2-3310","It's about time. I assume the duke sent you? I am his personal messenger, you know.nnWell, what are you waiting for? Untie me!",""
"55049764-2-3311","As I said, I appreciate your help before, but in this situation, I can't afford to have someone questioning my authority.nnPlease. Just leave town. Easier for all of us.",""
"55049764-2-3313","Haha! My spirit soars to see you return in one piece. And you found the ledger, Ruptga bless you.nnPlease, take it to this constable and prove that we are friends and in need of assistance.",""
"55049764-2-3314","If you can just take care of those portals, I'm sure the rest of the scamps will wander off eventually.",""
"55049764-2-3316","Turns out that almost everyone in town thinks Pascal has been acting strangeeven the guards.nnDid you find anything that explains his behavior?",""
"55049764-2-3320","If you find Lucas, I'll be eternally grateful. He's just an innocent boy.nnIn a minute, I'll have to go get dinner ready, but I'm going to keep his plate warm.",""
"55049764-2-3321","My mother may have gone totally insane, but it's all right. My dad's here, and we're still a family.",""
"55049764-2-3324","Gods strike you! Couldn't you have just waited five more minutes?nnThe slavers outside the tent were talking about where their base of operations is … then they got interrupted. I'm guessing they saw you.nnMy mom sent you, didn't she?",""
"55049764-2-3325","I don't understand. Sir Hughes served me for so many years. Loyally. Faithfully. nnWhy would he murder my wife?",""
"55049764-2-3327","Don't let anyone fool you. Any conscript who's unhappy with his life here can skulk off at any time.nnThe conscripts stay here for a reason. They want to fight ogres.",""
"55049764-2-3328","Lucas. Lucas. Lucas. That's all she talks about. nnMargot's worried sick about the boy. At this point, you'd think she'd have gotten over it.",""
"55049764-2-3329","Well, that didn't work. Time to come up with a new plan … again.",""
"55049764-2-3331","You are either suicidal or simply very stupid to barge in here without my permission. I will waste no further time with you. Be gone!",""
"55049764-2-3336","I didn't know his wife was here, too.nnWhen he dies, who will care for their children?",""
"55049764-2-3340","Listen to this braggart. Claims he could drop us all with a hand behind his back. The nerve.nnAnd King Fahara'jad claims these warriors are here in a diplomatic capacity? Preposterous!",""
"55049764-2-3342","I was useless. The last thing I remember clearly is kissing Rosa before going to sleep.nnMy poor Rosa.",""
"55049764-2-3344","I don't know who's been keeping the Ebonheart Pact busy, but I've seen more of the beach than I have in days.",""
"55049764-2-3345","I feel there are still others who need help.nnSeek out <<1>> near the town square. Find what disturbs him and help free him from his worries.",""
"55049764-2-3346","You know what I'd love to do? I'd love to lay waste to every last one of these poxy clowns, but the constable says we're to just guard the door.nnAt least I'll get to watch them starve.",""
"55049764-2-3357","Soon, my husband and I will travel to Wayrest to get away from these gossipy provincial villagers.",""
"55049764-2-3360","Twenty Blackhearts dead! Squawk!",""
"55049764-2-3362","The Herd Mother blesses us with these challenges, <<1>>.nnHow else can we learn about the lives our ancestors lived?",""
"55049764-2-3363","When we've chased off the last of these sabre cats, our lands will be safe, and our horses will roam freely again.",""
"55049764-2-3364","Well done, <<1>>!",""
"55049764-2-3367","It is the legend of <<1>> that he cannot die within his stronghold, this <<2>>. My father proved it true.nnHis crew speaks of this legend, and of the spirits their captain keeps in thrall. Stop the source of his magic, and Blackheart will be undone.",""
"55049764-2-3368","You spoke with General Thoda? Please tell us, tell the Duchess what he said.",""
"55049764-2-3369","I will return home and speak with King Fahara'jhad. I hope we can now focus on the loss of the one we loved rather than the crime that took her life. nnTime heals all wounds, or so they say.",""
"55049764-2-3370","Nothing about this has been easy, and it will be hard to look back on these events with anything other than sadness.nnI am glad you came along, though. Without you, we might not be able to look back on these days at all.",""
"55049764-2-3376","I've heard not everyone in the Union likes Count Hosni's new direction. Maybe, if you ask, someone in there will help you.",""
"55049764-2-3377","I can breathe again, knowing we're all safe at last. nnBut you, my friend. Now we have you to worry about.",""
"55049764-2-3379","Have you changed your mind? My offer still stands.",""
"55049764-2-3383","Trouble and trouble has come to Fell's Run. I hope you aren't bringing more, stranger.",""
"55049764-2-3385","What brings you to the end of the world? You're a new face, not from one of the Shornhelm houses, by the looks of you.nnPardon my mood. News that he's using the Lightless Remnants up there makes a positive outcome rather unlikely.",""
"55049764-2-3387","Verandis be damned! I will not stand by as our own soldiers are used against us.nnThis is why Verandis ordered us away from the spire. He knew we would be easy pickings if we simply charged in. This is maddening!",""
"55049764-2-3390","Move along. The general is not entertaining guests right now.",""
"55049764-2-3392","<<1>> is the only champion left.nnWatch it: he's not called the Scourge of the Arena for nothing.",""
"55049764-2-3394","I'm glad to be safe and sound by the fire. I don't think I'll be travelling the mountain passes alone again for some time.",""
"55049764-2-3395","Good luck against those champions!",""
"55049764-2-3398","My blood fever poultice could do a lot of good right now. I hope you can find enough spider ichor.nnOh, look! There goes a spider now!",""
"55049764-2-3399","We will need armor to fight these monsters: armor and luck.nnI hope the Nords don't invade while we're under attack here.",""
"55049764-2-3401","I knew that the ancients must have sent you to us, <<1>>.nnMay their spirits watch over you.",""
"55049764-2-3405","I can hardly believe it. <<1>> killed, and here I am speaking to the one who did it.nnI hated that Orc. If I could watch him die again, I would.",""

"55049764-2-3411","We surely would have perished in that cave if not for your heroics, <<1>>. Thank you.",""
"55049764-2-3412","Your friends in the Daggerfall Covenant would gladly send you to Balfiera Island. They always need more reinforcements for their war. Just ask for a battlemaster in one of your alliance cities.",""
"55049764-2-3415","The Zero Stone will restore the staff. It was laid by the gods themselves, back before the dawn.nnIt's so simple! And yet … I fear the journey will be anything but.",""
"55049764-2-3416","My father went to greet the returning foals. You'll find him down at the paddock.",""
"55049764-2-3418","Before you can reach Shiri, you'll have to unseal the vault. You must destroy <<1>> and <<2>>. Then collect blood from their undead husks.nnYou'll also find one of the Ansei Wards on the corpse of <<2>>. Perhaps you can save it from its fate.",""
"55049764-2-3421","You're back. What happened?",""
"55049764-2-3422","I've trained some of Northpoint's finest soldiers.nnThese farmers will be a challenge, but at least they're no strangers to hard work.",""
"55049764-2-3423","You did well. Roy couldn't have handled things any better.",""
"55049764-2-3424","Welcome back! Do you need more flowers?",""

"55049764-2-3446","They were hiding here among us, weren't they? I thought as much. nnI hate missing out on killing werewolves, but I had, well, something else I had to keep an eye on.",""
"55049764-2-3448","I'm getting too old for this. Wasn't fast enough to avoid that blade to my knee.",""
"55049764-2-3451","The Red Rooks are done here. We'll be able to clear the rest of them out.",""
"55049764-2-3452","Traveler, there's trouble ahead. Bandits. You should turn back. We can't guarantee your safety.",""
"55049764-2-3453","Who goes there? Identify yourself.",""
"55049764-2-3456","Get everyone back here and we can keep them safe. For a while. In the meantime, we'll work on what to do next.nnAnd make sure you put those fires out. This building won't provide much protection if it burns to the ground.",""

"55049764-2-3463","I understand that saving my husband was just the latest in a series of heroic acts to save Stormhaven.nnThis was a threat to the Daggerfall Covenant as a whole, so Alik'r thanks you as well.",""

"55049764-2-3471","He killed them, didn't he? By Stendarr, that's one more score we need to settle with Faolchu. nnIt's my fault. I should have acted sooner. I shouldn't have waited for proof that the Duke had been cursed.",""
"55049764-2-3472","Haven't seen that Fausta woman around have you? Oh, never mind. I'll find her later.",""
"55049764-2-3474","Please hurry. There's no telling what they plan to do with the captive women.nnThis is all my fault. I wish we'd never left Camlorn.",""

"55049764-2-3479","A spirit spoke to you? You need to continue this line of investigation and see where it leads.",""
"55049764-2-3482","Wonder why Lord Diel is so interested in keeping these things alive? What can you learn when a damn harpy is trying to peck your eyes out?",""

"55049764-2-3485","I'm not sure I completely understand what's going on here. There is a harpy menaceisn't there?",""
"55049764-2-3486","Quick! Hide the eggs in his bed before he gets back to his tent!",""
"55049764-2-3490","Taking a bit of reward, eh? Go ahead. I'll be taking some to pay the others, myself.",""
"55049764-2-3491","You found Guy. I hope you can save the others, too.",""
"55049764-2-3493","Your actions have changed the balance of power in the bog.nnMother Murk's power wanes. Now the bog belongs to the Wyrd.",""
"55049764-2-3494","You've lifted a great burden from my heart, friend.",""
"55049764-2-3500","Those wizards called our ancestors from the necropolis! Why did they do that? What did we do to deserve this?",""
"55049764-2-3501","You made it here at last, <<1>>, as was foreseen. I'm glad I was here to meet you. nnYou are the key to defeating the Withered Hand. To do so completely, you must defeat them in Satakalaam.",""
"55049764-2-3502","I have many friends still lying in the stables. Killing the Daedra and harvesting their hearts would help the at-Aswals.nnThen make your way to the tower north of <<1>> and speak to the stablemaster. Once the beasts are gone, we can bury the dead.",""
"55049764-2-3505","That is the Gem of Westtry's Torment. How you acquired it, I don't want to know.  nnBut quickly, use it to free the villagers from this terrible curse.",""
"55049764-2-3506","Hawthorn shrubs grow throughout the village. Just pluck a few berries and get them to Muriel at the apothecary shop.",""

"55049764-2-3519","Well, we're still alive.nnBut it's only a matter of time, of course. Even if we escape the hags, there's still the werewolves.",""
"55049764-2-3521","Aha! Perfect! Say though, you didn't happen to pick up a few giant's toes while you were at the bazaar, did you?",""
"55049764-2-3522","This should be interesting.",""
"55049764-2-3523","Best of luck, my brave friend.",""

"55049764-2-3537","Soon <<1>> will leave this dangerous Lanylantown and go somewhere nice.nnShe heard of a place called Saakatalama? Maybe <<1>> will sell something there.",""
"55049764-2-3538","My brethren will hear of your actions. You have proven yourself a true ally of the Ancestor Moths.",""
"55049764-2-3540","My sisters return to camp. Speak with the guardian.",""
"55049764-2-3541","I shall return the rest of the <<1>> to the King of Daggerfall.nnBy rights, the treasure is his, but it doesn't hurt to gain the favor for the Ancestor Moths.",""

"55049764-2-3547","The tower in the north courtyard contains the gate works. Get in there and lock it down. nnIf you stop more werewolves from coming in, we should be able to deal with the ones that are already here.",""
"55049764-2-3551","My spirit knows peace again. Thank you, <<1>>.",""
"55049764-2-3552","You return? I cannot believe … do you have the relics?",""
"55049764-2-3553","What a fantastic plan, I must say! So much excitement!",""
"55049764-2-3554","That was terrifying! A tad thrilling, too. But terrifying!",""
"55049764-2-3555","Stendarr bless you.",""
"55049764-2-3556","Thanks for helping the Duke. I'm glad I don't have to have his death on my conscience.",""
"55049764-2-3557","Take the path down to the beach. nnI'm too weak to walk, so I'll use my magic and meet you there.",""
"55049764-2-3559","General Gautier's troops are to the east, in the siege camp. nnThe wolves are on the offensive, so watch yourself.",""
"55049764-2-3560","Let Gautier know we're safe. I've got to get the wounded to the healers.",""
"55049764-2-3562","Thank you for directing the women here. They will be well cared for.",""
"55049764-2-3564","On your way, forester apprentice. Next step is journeyman. Learn more recipes. Craft more gear.nnGot some for sale, if you want. Luck in the trees.",""
"55049764-2-3565","Who are you? Are you working for the Withered Hand, or are you one of those Imperial dogs?",""
"55049764-2-3566","Go. We have nothing more to say.",""
"55049764-2-3568","Who … who are you? Please don't kill me.",""
"55049764-2-3569","I'll protect the portal and keep the Bloodthorn at bay. You go rescue my father.",""
"55049764-2-3570","Did you break the spell? I feel... different.",""
"55049764-2-3571","It seems I misjudged you. Thank you for assisting my warriors.nnWould you speak to Zal at-Zazir? Find out how successful he's been in dealing with the poison.",""
"55049764-2-3572","Now I know who sent you. It was Morwha herself!",""
"55049764-2-3573","We're committed to aiding the Lion Guard, so do as the General suggests.nnIt's not like we have a better option at the moment.",""
"55049764-2-3574","Thank you for helping us, wayfarer. nnI know my father explained everything, but I would add a desperate plea. Please do not just accept Enneh's word. Look elsewhere in the town. Whatever it takes to find Casnar and bring him here.",""
"55049764-2-3575","You know, I think we might actually have a chance of pulling this off.nnWell … if you can actually convince Uncle Thakh to let me out …. Hmm. Maybe we don't have a chance after all.",""
"55049764-2-3578","Welcome to Bergama, wayfarer! We have the finest musical instruments in Hammerfell!nnI am just closing up shop now, but if you want a harp, a lute, or even a drum, come back another time.",""
"55049764-2-3579","Try your hand at my gaming tables.  We've got cards, dice, and good company. nnStay as long as you want. You might win big. No guarantees, of course.",""
"55049764-2-3580","My man will let you pass now.",""
"55049764-2-3581","And here we are, at the inn, all safe and sound. More or less. nnWe saw the light and followed you inside.",""
"55049764-2-3586","You placed my stone well. I should be protected this close to the tree.",""
"55049764-2-3587","The Eight protect you, stranger. The Sentinel Guard is looking for assistance, and you look like a capable sort.nnNormally, I'd never ask someone just arrived to Sentinel for this kind of aid, but an outlander is exactly what we need right now.",""
"55049764-2-3589","So spiders flooded the mine!nnI hope everyone got out all right.",""
"55049764-2-3590","Please speak to me once you have finished your business here with <<1>>.nnI know she's been awaiting your return.",""
"55049764-2-3591","Bahir's brief capture doesn't seem to have phased him. Thank you for your help today, <<1>>.",""
"55049764-2-3592","Once Bahir reappeared, the dockworkers finally began to calm down. I think we have almost everything under control here. Sure, they're still a bit wary, but who wouldn't be?",""
"55049764-2-3595","Finally! Someone who's not afraid to do the dirty work. Someone to clean up my docks! I watched you from the window until I heard those necromancers downstairs. nnBut I thought Maujad was coming here toodid you see him?",""
"55049764-2-3597","We just watched boats filled with Bloodthorn cultists sail away from the docks. What happened down there?",""
"55049764-2-3598","Your advances are sweet, walker. nnMaybe we will cross paths again in the next life and things will be different.",""
"55049764-2-3601","Thank you for your help, <<1>>. I'll return to Bergama once my horse has rested from the long run.nnAnd don't worry. I'll send someone to fetch Sergeant Ra'ud's body and consecrate it before the Withered Hand can raise him from the dead.",""
"55049764-2-3602","Darien talks of nothing but wine and women, but behind his bluster he's a better tactician than his father. nnThough that's not saying much.",""
"55049764-2-3607","Will someone just let me know whether or not we're going to get paid for this? I could really use the gold.",""
"55049764-2-3608","That didn't seem right.",""
"55049764-2-3609","Thank you again for collapsing the tunnel. Now all we need to do is chase off the Imperial dogs that are still here.nnTo think this scum would ally with corrupted madmen from the Withered Hand!",""
"55049764-2-3613","I have prepared a new body for <<1>>. He will be a terror on the battlefield!nnDo you have the souls we need to complete the ritual?",""
"55049764-2-3617","You walk toward me with such purpose ... is there something on your mind, my dear?",""
"55049764-2-3622","I'm sure that you realize that with the Reachmen bearing down on us, I have a great many matters to attend to.nnI absolutely do not wish to be rude, but I must be going. Come back another time and I will endeavor to answer all your questions.",""
"55049764-2-3626","Good day to you. Have you come at the summons of her ladyship?",""
"55049764-2-3627","Ah, you're back. And in a timely manner. Did you find the crown?",""
"55049764-2-3628","Grave wort is very common in <<1>>.nnThe plants have a distinctive musty odor and pale, fragile flowers. You'll need one plant for each tomb.",""
"55049764-2-3629","The owner must be in the Mages Guild.nnWhy they would take this poor boy's body, I don't know. You must find out before harm comes to him.",""
"55049764-2-3632","May Tu'whacca bless this place at last.",""
"55049764-2-3633","Who are you? What business do you have bothering a dead man?",""
"55049764-2-3634","I trust General Gautier. Follow his orders and the city will be ours again.",""
"55049764-2-3635","Get into that tower and lock that gate. We'll be right behind you.",""
"55049764-2-3636","Please, do not let me linger.nnComplete the ritual and remove the curse.",""
"55049764-2-3637","I wouldn't stick around here. Reinforcements are on the way. They'll take over now.",""
"55049764-2-3638","Necromancy? Why, I never would have dreamed ….nnIf the Reach magicians have infiltrated our ranks so easily, our mages must be on alert. I will let them know.",""
"55049764-2-3640","Go and find that bothersome noble. She's not far, just down the passageway.",""
"55049764-2-3646","You showed great bravery entering the mines, <<1>>. The stories about you are true.",""
"55049764-2-3647","With the heirs of Suturah running loose in Alik'r, the Aldmeri Dominion is the last problem we need to worry about.nnThanks to you, they won't be coming back.",""
"55049764-2-3651","Don't worry. I'll take the priest to Prince Adrien. nnHopefully, the prince has regained enough strength to walk to the church. I don't think I can carry him in full plate, and I'm betting our friendly priest here won't be much help.",""
"55049764-2-3652","The Ash'abah need your help. Go to the Tears of the Dishonored to the east.nnI pray that my vision did not come too late.",""
"55049764-2-3653","What the Prince has become ... it's an insult to the Divines!",""
"55049764-2-3654","Whatever that thing is, it is no longer my grandson.nnIt must be destroyed!",""
"55049764-2-3655","Please, don't hurt me! I don't want to die!nnWait, you're not the creature that attacked my father. You're not even one of the Montclairs.",""
"55049764-2-3659","Though I hate the undead, I can't help but pity the men and women they once were. nnTu'whacca, guide me!",""
"55049764-2-3664","No! No, please! Leave me alone! I haven't done anything.",""
"55049764-2-3666","You've done my family a great service today.nnWe won't forget what you've done for us.",""
"55049764-2-3667","I don't remember inviting you aboard. Make your business quick, or you'll be picking seaweed out of your teeth.",""
"55049764-2-3670","The captain headed in the direction of the inn. You should be able to catch up. Find out what she's up to and then take all this to the queen.nnIf this prompts her into action, it might just be worth it. She would make a wonderful ruler, you know.",""
"55049764-2-3671","And the troublemaker appears again!nnTake care you know your place. The next time we meet, my greeting may not be so cordial.",""
"55049764-2-3674","Why would she ask to meet me in the gardens behind the castle? I'd prefer a less uncouth area, one with fewer flies and peasants.nnI'm sure she has her reasons, but I'm too busy with my negotiations anyway.",""
"55049764-2-3675","This will take time, but the gargoyles will eventually return to normal. You've taken away a potentially deadly resource from the Imperials.nnAnd you've shown that I can trust some people. That change is more difficult and will also take time.",""
"55049764-2-3683","You certainly made short work of those Elves. There seem to be few odd skeletons down here, no problem for you, I'm sure.nnNow, I assume you found the old tome in my camp?",""
"55049764-2-3684","The stone rules the flesh, here as everywhere. Flesh must always yield to stone.",""
"55049764-2-3685","You are a noble spirit and a brave soul, my friend. nnYou've done me a good turn here, and by exposing Stibbons' uselessness, you've done Lady Laurent a favor too.",""
"55049764-2-3686","You're not one of Gharzu's men! I thought … I mean, I wasn't trying to do anything! It was just for the gold. I's rough nowadays!nnThey meet us in the South Ward, where they pay us. Strange coins, but gold is gold!",""
"55049764-2-3688","Have you crafted the ring?",""
"55049764-2-3689","Evoker Valinwe can be found in Aldcroft, to the east of here.",""
"55049764-2-3692","There is an ill feeling surrounding that ship.nnI will pray for your success.",""
"55049764-2-3693","Have you crafted the ring",""
"55049764-2-3694","It's good to see the Duke back in Camlorn. This is where he belongs.",""
"55049764-2-3695","Get the recipe from Falbert. Once you learned it talk to me…",""

"55049764-2-3697","He wandered as a vulture circles its prey. But he truly has no sense of direction, and thus managed to wander farther away with each passing moment.nnWe must find him.",""
"55049764-2-3699","A familiar scent surrounds you. Did the Sentinel send you? What do you hold?",""
"55049764-2-3700","That certainly wasn't my finest hour, but I thought … I thought it was Arkay. I thought he was giving me a second chance.nnThere's nothing more foul than this creature's deception. It must've hailed from the depths of Oblivion itself!",""
"55049764-2-3703","I've known Stenwick since I was a child. Just because we didn't agree on many things, doesn't mean his burial tradition should be ignored.nnI'd hoped for a change with his death, but it seems the princess will continue the Sentinel's work. A shame.",""
"55049764-2-3705","The <<1>> should make itself known to you. You'll have to keep your eyes open for a sign.nnOf course, there's other, less subtle ways of getting its attention. They say the forest feels the death of every creature.",""
"55049764-2-3708","Where are the rest of the reinforcements? Are you all they sent?",""
"55049764-2-3709","You're not from the Reach, are you? Sometimes, it's hard to tell.",""
"55049764-2-3710","<Medya's torso is covered in old and faded Reachman tattoos which were previously obscured by her humble peasant's attire.>",""
"55049764-2-3712","I can't believe it. You gave the tools to Tamien? How could you?nnNow I'll never get back to Lady Laurent's good graces!",""
"55049764-2-3714","Stenwick only asked for Wyrd's blessing to be kind, but they don't seem ready to help him, do they?",""
"55049764-2-3716","This beautiful woman from the Mages Guild just arrived. Says she knows you! You can introduce me later.nnI was right about the amulets, though, wasn't I?",""
"55049764-2-3721","Lead on, <<1>>! I'm a gardener, not a fighter.nnThe sooner we get away from these angry spirits, the better.",""
"55049764-2-3724","The rescued miners are singing your praises. Well done!",""
"55049764-2-3726","The king will be grateful for what we've done here. Some of Angof's minions are still running loose, but it's nothing we can't handle.nnMaybe things will finally return to normal now.",""
"55049764-2-3729","All Crosswych is talking about you. nnThe Red Rooks are on the run. If they try to stop, we'll chase them right out of town.",""
"55049764-2-3731","Thanks to you, I have <<1>> back!nnI won't forget what you've done for us.",""
"55049764-2-3734","What answers the call is the Hunger.",""
"55049764-2-3735","Get to Lainlyn, comrade. <<1>> will fill you in on the details when you get there.",""
"55049764-2-3740","Report! nnHave you stopped the Withered Hand from recruiting the Saltwalker Company?",""
"55049764-2-3746","That amulet reminds me of happier times. The sunlight on her hair. The way she laughed. Her smile ….nnShe meant the world to me. Getting this amulet back brings me hope, <<1>>.",""
"55049764-2-3747","My aching back! And just look what all this laundry is doing to my hands!nnStill, if this is the only way I can earn ration tickets, then I'll do laundry day and night until we can return home.",""
"55049764-2-3748","Well, we've been through quite a bit together, haven't we? nnI think I like you. You're fun! Stop by and visit if you're ever in the neighborhood!",""
"55049764-2-3749","I have a strange sense of liberation now, with my thirst for revenge quenched, and my material ties dissolved. I could go anywhere … be anything ….",""
"55049764-2-3750","You'll find the dead throughout the ruins.nnPlenty remained after the Ra Gada.",""
"55049764-2-3751","Congratulations. You did what I could not, <<1>>.",""
"55049764-2-3754","Hm. I suppose that answers the question. Our fates are no more fixed than the wind that blows across these dunes.nnUnless … do you think maybe that was not the right wind storm? Do you believe that maybe there is another … just about to appear?",""
"55049764-2-3756","I'm sorry I wasn't there when you killed Angof. I needed to get the others back here safety. I think they'll recover. Now if only Darien would stop distracting me with his chatter.nnAnyway, you really are something.",""
"55049764-2-3758","I'll speak to the matriarch. She may offer us aid.nnThe bloodletting I leave to you.",""
"55049764-2-3760","Given how many of us were hurt at the garrison, prisoners aren't high on the priority list.nnI hope we can get his wounds treated quickly.",""
"55049764-2-3761","Good luck. Show no mercy to these elven invaders!",""
"55049764-2-3763","Always remember the lesson you've learned here today, friend. Fate does not control those who are willing to step to the fore. Set your hand against fortune, and you will see your wishes fulfilled.",""
"55049764-2-3764","Medya needed to die for all that she's done here.nnThe people of Evermore need not hear whatever lies she would use to defend herself at a trial.",""
"55049764-2-3765","Clarisse is lucky I'm sharing this information with her. I'm just smart enough to know she probably won't be the one reassembling the amulet. nnI can't allow the curse to befall someone just doing her bidding.",""
"55049764-2-3767","Now I must pray that the gargoyles return to sleep before any more damage is done.",""

"55049764-2-3772","We must hurry, before Kerbol does anything more to hurt my husband!",""
"55049764-2-3776","He speaks the truth. I've bound everyone here to this village, but by doing so, freed them from the curse of lycanthropy. They all chose it willingly.nnThink what you want of it, but each of our sacrifices is for the greater good.",""
"55049764-2-3777","My commander will hear of your exploits, I promise you.",""
"55049764-2-3778","My father believes it's time for us to integrate with the humans. I trust him, but I can't help but feel a bit frightened.nnOur kind hasn't always been able to ignore our base impulses. People have a good reason not to trust us.",""
"55049764-2-3784","Is that … is that blood all mine? All of it? I don't think that's good.nnIf I die, I swear by Malacath that I'll come back for you.",""
"55049764-2-3786","You have shown great skill in your hunt. Lord Hircine will be pleased.",""
"55049764-2-3788","Now that you've picked a lizard, you can enter it in a race. Put your lizard in a starting cage when you're ready, and let's watch that baby fly!",""
"55049764-2-3790","Welcome. I've heard we've you to thank for ridding <<1>> of those Imperials.nnI'm glad to see you're paying us a visit.",""
"55049764-2-3791","I'm certainly glad you came to Crosswych. People wanted to fight back, but they just needed some encouragement.",""
"55049764-2-3793","You have a triumphant look about you. Spit it out, have you the key or not?",""
"55049764-2-3794","<The dog pants happily.>",""
"55049764-2-3795","If you plan to enter your lizard in a race, you'll need to put it in a starting cage.",""
"55049764-2-3796","<<1>> will never again threaten <<2>>, thanks to you.",""
"55049764-2-3799","I wish you luck in consecrating those foul bones.nnNo necromancer should be suffered to live, let alone find undeath.",""
"55049764-2-3802","The trolls weren't much of a nuisance, at least to anyone outside of the woods, but lately, they've been getting bolder … and hungrier.nnIt's a shame that it's come to this.",""
"55049764-2-3803","Food will be harder to come by now that we aren't getting help from the Imperials. I hope that we will still be able to feed everyone.",""
"55049764-2-3805","Excellent work, <<1>>!nnThe souls of Motalion Necropolis rest easily once again.",""
"55049764-2-3807","I'm glad most of my people took the cure. Whatever benefits being a werewolf may bring, living apart from society seems too high a price.",""
"55049764-2-3810","Bonebreaker's crypt is northeast of this chapel, beneath the hillside.nnThe entrance is near the shore of Halcyon Lake.",""
"55049764-2-3813","It hurts … it hurts! Go … away!",""
"55049764-2-3815","In addition to the public praise, I must add my own private words of appreciation, wayfarer.nnYou not only saved the kingdom, you also saved its king. My reign would have been buried in the sands had you not intervened. Thank you.",""
"55049764-2-3818","<<1>> told us what you need.nnI'm … afraid … of going through that.",""
"55049764-2-3819","They don't suspect, do they? Surprise! Surprise on the dancers. Surprise on Madame Lurue. nnHer black book is in her sanctuary, beyond the dancers. Stop them all! End of the dance. It's time to go home.",""
"55049764-2-3821","I think my luck's about to change for the better … oh yes.",""
"55049764-2-3822","I'll be sure to report your bravery to my superiors, friend.",""
"55049764-2-3823","Now that we've completed the repairs, we need more laborers to work the rain catchers, or we'll fall behind Sentinel's demands for water.",""
"55049764-2-3824","Mara's mercy! You scared the life out of me!",""
"55049764-2-3825","She succeeded with your help.nnMind you, that is nothing against the princess. Gurles needed help, too.",""
"55049764-2-3828","Destroy the relics! They keep me trapped here.",""
"55049764-2-3832","No one died today. It's all because of your help.nnMay Tava lend speed your steps, traveler.",""
"55049764-2-3833","Your actions today have saved lives, wayfarer. You should be proud.nnRemember that as you bed down tonight.",""
"55049764-2-3834","We will scout the Imperial forces while you free the others from the barracks.",""
"55049764-2-3835","Now that you have the goods, take them to Ildani, and then to the buyers. nnDon't worry. We'll be watching. If anything goes wrong, we'll have your back.",""
"55049764-2-3836","My son is safe and my family has been restored to me.nnYou are truly a gift from merciful Stendarr.",""
"55049764-2-3837","Without your help, I would have been a meal for the jackals.",""
"55049764-2-3839","Once the commander is dead, the rest of the Imperial troops will scatter.",""
"55049764-2-3841","I hardly see why you deserved payment at all. Still, you are one of the few who actually bothered to return to let me know.",""
"55049764-2-3844","I'm glad we won't be seeing any overgrown alligators in these parts anytime soon.",""
"55049764-2-3846","<The captain lies writhing on the ground. Nightmare fire streams from braziers to his struggling form.>",""
"55049764-2-3849","Speak to Lorelia and listen to her wisdom.",""
"55049764-2-3850","This is the entrance to her lair. I'm sure of it. nnI don't see her in there, so I think it's safe to go in and search for the stolen relics.",""
"55049764-2-3851","Go away before the guards catch us!",""
"55049764-2-3853","I look forward to doing business with you in the future!",""
"55049764-2-3854","Thanks to the Baandari, I can maintain a pretty decent lifestyle.",""
"55049764-2-3855","You know, we're supposed to be keeping this relationship subtle.",""
"55049764-2-3857","Have you gotten all those focus pieces yet?",""
"55049764-2-3860","I must insist that you go away, leave me be, and do whatever it is you intend to do with whomever else you intend to do it.",""
"55049764-2-3861","Hurry! You need to switch the orders before they start to move out for Volenfell. nnThey could strike camp suddenly. You never know with armies … it's always hurry up and wait.",""
"55049764-2-3862","I'd check the Mages Guild in Daggerfall if I were you. They must have a scroll or a tome that will tell us how to speak with the spirits of the dead.",""
"55049764-2-3867","I wish we'd be rid of Alimah's Gallants. The idiots don't wear armor, and they're constantly running around where the enemy isn't. Cowards.nnAnd don't get me started on the stench of horse droppings. Confound those horses! They drive me to drink.",""
"55049764-2-3879","Praise the Golden Eye! That foul creature could be here any moment, and I wouldn't have wanted to face her without you.nnWhatever happens, we can't let her get to the shrine! Are you ready?",""
"55049764-2-3880","Do you dare to ask more of me?",""
"55049764-2-3881","We should hurry. The longer the connection to Cold Harbor remains open, the more danger we're in.nnWe need to break that connection as soon as possible.",""

"55049764-2-3893","Quickly! There isn't much time!",""
"55049764-2-3895","Look for the Bloodthorn envoy in the central part of the ruins.nnBe careful though. Once he falls, disguise or not, they'll come after you with everything they have. Only your wits and your weapons will get you out of there in one piece.",""

"55049764-2-3906","You don't look like one of those vampires or bloodfiends, so I guess you're welcome. This is Camp Tamrith. We're sheltering the refugees from Crestshade and the surrounding countryside here.",""
"55049764-2-3907","The fractures were a threat to all of <<1>> … and perhaps all of Tamriel!nnClosing them was an act of true heroism.",""

"55049764-2-3929","Nuwarrah's family has alway been a thorn in my side. Now that I helped save the city, she'll probably host a feast in honor of the deed.nnThat could mar my reputation with the Thieves Guild. The woman is impossible.",""

"55049764-2-4240","<<1>> and I are going to rest before we brave the road to Mud Tree.nnMaybe you should rest, too. You don't look so well.",""
"55049764-2-4244","Ah, you're a brave person, right? I mean, that's what people say. I'm Sonding and I guess … I mean I don't know … maybe you can help. nnEveryone here is too focused on kidnappings and murders to listen to me, but I'm sure it's important.",""
"55049764-2-4245","You've seen me up here, writing? Letters sent, but not returned. Why do I keep writing to him if he doesn't care?nnPerhaps the mire has finally taken him. I've been sending letters to a corpse.",""
"55049764-2-4248","May the Three watch over you. From what I've been hearing, if anyone could find our missing vicecanon, it's you.",""
"55049764-2-4249","The Pact thanks you for joining the war effort! With talented crafters like yourself at our back, there's no challenge we can't overcome.nnAkatosh bless your wares, friend.",""
"55049764-2-4255","Get the recipe from <<1>>. Once you learned it talk to me",""
"55049764-2-4256","Excellent! I see my companions have assembled. Now, we can open the portal to the ritual chamber. Just let me know when you are ready.",""
"55049764-2-4257","You must summon the guardians. We'll handle the scamps. We'll meet you at the top. nnWalks-in-Ash should already be there. She's always been a stealthy sort.",""
"55049764-2-4258","The wind has carried you here with your scales unburnt.nnWhat do we do now?",""
"55049764-2-4259","Shor's bones! nnClosing those caves saved lives! We're all in your debt.",""
"55049764-2-4260","Once she has grown bored with her Altmer lover, she'll discard him for another. nnAnd like a man-eating beast, she has grown a taste for mortal attentions.",""
"55049764-2-4261","You've caused enough trouble!nn<<1>> will hear of this! You were sent here to upset my wife! Begone, before I lose my temper.",""
"55049764-2-4262","Have you crafted the ring?",""
"55049764-2-4263","The acolytes await your assistance. Speak to them as soon as you can. I fear for their safety.",""
"55049764-2-4264","We're not dead. Amazing!nnI need a little time to recover. Go speak to Vaama and get that other Daedric essence.",""
"55049764-2-4265","That worked! And no strange side effects.nnQuickly now. Go to the other ruin and speak to <<1>>.",""
"55049764-2-4266","We are gathering the essences of these Daedra. Speak with the acolytes. They know how to summon them.",""
"55049764-2-4271","Your help dealing with those Supernal Dreamers was greatly appreciated.",""
"55049764-2-4272","Thanks again for your help, friend.",""
"55049764-2-4275","Thanks again for recovering the shards.  My wizard says it will be mended soon.",""
"55049764-2-4276","I see you rescued my son. He is a good boy, if a bit… incapable.",""
"55049764-2-4277","Thanks for returning my crystal. You have no idea how much that thing is worth. Certainly more than you'll ever earn in your life.",""
"55049764-2-4278","The cave ahead is probably the best approach, as the path to the north goes through the center of the Hollow and right into the thick of Vox's forces. nnDestroy the three wards, blessed one!",""
"55049764-2-4279","Have you crafted the ring?",""
"55049764-2-4280","Speak to my father. He's been asking for you.",""
"55049764-2-4281","How many of those torchbug-gobblers did you flatten? I bet it was half a dozen.nnWait, you still have the <<z:1>>? Quick, get it to Chieftain Suhlak! If Clavicus Vile lifts his curse while you still hold it, you'll die for good!",""
"55049764-2-4282","Hurry to the Tribunal Temple. Don't keep the Sacred Lady waiting.",""
"55049764-2-4283","I'm terribly sorry, I can't spend more time chatting. There are a lot of people waiting for registration who don't have the same clout as you do.",""
"55049764-2-4286","You showed those Wood Elf rats? Now we are the proud owners of this treasure!nnWell, us and a few others.",""
"55049764-2-4293","Vivec's trial will measure your clarity of judgment. He saw our blessed people through vexing times. His wisdom reveals the secrets others keep.nnSo shall yours be put to the test.",""
"55049764-2-4294","I'm sure one of the other aides told you to talk to <<1>>. He's in the center of town.nnIt's the way we do things here, stranger.",""
"55049764-2-4295","You look new here, stranger. I hope one of the other aides directed you to speak with <<1>>.nnYou can find him in the center of town.",""
"55049764-2-4297","Wha … was I sleeping? I saw an Argonian waif, crying for help.nnMy head feels like it's trying to leave my body. I need to sit down.",""
"55049764-2-4299","You've made us proud today.",""
"55049764-2-4300","Head to the front line. See what you can find. We'll speak when you return.",""
"55049764-2-4304","Welcome to the Daggerfall Mages Guild. What can I do for you on this day blessed by the Eight?",""
"55049764-2-4306","Those Elven blackguards deserve every bit of trouble that comes to them.",""
"55049764-2-4308","I … where am I? Do you hear it? The voice is gone. It's gone!nnBy the Lord General's sword! How long was I out?",""
"55049764-2-4310","How did I get this far into the ruins?nnThe goblin totem! Where is it? I need it!",""
"55049764-2-4311","I … I am awake, aren't I? This is real. Isn't it?",""
"55049764-2-4313","You've got the missing stone fragments? Let's see if we can activate it, then. You go ahead.",""
"55049764-2-4314","You're surprised … or frightened. It's difficult for me to determine which.",""
"55049764-2-4316","I can't believe our guards were slain by the Worm Cult! How will we make it safely to Mud Tree?",""
"55049764-2-4317","If those guards were slain by the Worm Cult, their spirits must be freed. I shudder to think of what those necromancers will do with them.",""
"55049764-2-4318","You are kind. I don't think every sister tests her brother this way, but it has always been so with me and Pash-Riha.",""
"55049764-2-4319","Seven-Bellies would be pleased if I crawled back into an egg. Then he could sit on it and protect me.nnHis concern is not lost on me, but after I hatched, I'd still bite his tail.",""
"55049764-2-4322","Follow the gorge to the east and climb to the ruins. nnFight well.",""
"55049764-2-4323","You've done much to help us, but all may yet be undone.nnThe storage tunnel is just behind the temple. Seek out <<1>>. He'll be leading the defense. Help him keep our enemies at bay.",""
"55049764-2-4327","Welcome to the Fighters Guild! You look like the capable sort. Why have you come? Are you here to answer the Guildmaster's challenge?",""
"55049764-2-4329","Good luck in there. Remember, don't let anyone see you!",""
"55049764-2-4331","My favorite <<1>>! Were these different times I'd see you well fed and laughing. Lukiul Uxith was once quite a place.nnYou have something to tell me?",""
"55049764-2-4333","Let me take these goods back to my family, so they don't starve.",""
"55049764-2-4334","I hope my loose guar aren't causing any trouble.nnKeep it up! There are a few more out there.",""
"55049764-2-4337","The yard is secure. Once again, the Pact controls Fort Virak. nnYet <<1>> still lives. Where is he? He has much to answer for.",""
"55049764-2-4339","If you can find that bow, <<1>> would appreciate it.",""
"55049764-2-4340","What are you waiting for? Light the fire.",""
"55049764-2-4341","Good thing you came along when you did. I'm pretty sure they were preparing more unconventional methods of extracting information, if you know what I mean.",""
"55049764-2-4342","This is beyond what we usually handle. But the Shadowscales are up for any task.",""
"55049764-2-4343","We don't understand the full power of the keystones. Even one might give the Dominion terrible power.",""
"55049764-2-4344","If you're willing, I have another task for you.",""
"55049764-2-4345","Without you, we'd have been food for the <<mz:1>>.",""
"55049764-2-4346","The Dominion still hasn't found the keystone, you should still be able to swipe it under their nose.",""
"55049764-2-4348","I do believe this is our best work yet.",""
"55049764-2-4349","Got your pickaxe? Head into the Ashlanders' tunnel and use it to weaken the supports. We'll hold them off here.nnI won't wish you good luck. Only children and Altmer rely on it. I'd rather trust in your skill.",""
"55049764-2-4350","Dolril's safe, at least. Thank you for returning him to us.nnNow there's nothing to do but wait for these Ashlanders to grow tired of killing and leave.",""
"55049764-2-4352","Yes? What it is?",""
"55049764-2-4353","I heard fighting below. Are you all right?",""
"55049764-2-4359","I said I would turn the stuff in and I will. Though I still think it's a waste.",""
"55049764-2-4363","You threaten Vox, enraging her, forcing her to commit even more brutal atrocities! How glorious!nnSoon her army of Daedra and lost souls will march forth, unleashing new terrors across the land.",""
"55049764-2-4368","I never liked bugs. Now I positively hate them!",""
"55049764-2-4371","As I said, the other vicecanons broke away at the first sign of fighting. I don't know where those spineless cowards are, but we need to regroup if we're going to have a chance at this.",""
"55049764-2-4372","<<1>> was a sight to see, coming out of that cave. She makes a pretense of frailty, but she stood shoulder to shoulder with the rest of her troops. Such valiance is a rare trait in politicians.",""
"55049764-2-4373","Thank you for stopping <<1>>'s imposter. He deserved no less.",""
"55049764-2-4374","Can't … move! Help me!",""
"55049764-2-4375","Uhhh, uhhh!",""
"55049764-2-4376","My arms and legs won't work! Sep's blood, I don't want to be eaten by baby snakes!",""
"55049764-2-4377","Argh! It burns! It burns!",""
"55049764-2-4378","Just remember, this doesn't make us partners!",""
"55049764-2-4380","Ssethreka has this place in her coils. Her scales must be shorn and her fangs blunted!",""
"55049764-2-4383","No sign of <<1>>, but the Nord over there is definitely a skin-stealer. I know what he's planning to do with those prisoners. If I help out, you'll tell nobody about my Daedric relic-hunting, yes?",""
"55049764-2-4384","Now that you're here, we'll take the fight to the mountain. To Tanval.",""
"55049764-2-4387","The gatekeeper is the only thing standing in our way.",""
"55049764-2-4393","That faithless harlot! How dare she hone in on my deal!",""
"55049764-2-4395","You've completed my trial, mortal. Seek my colleague on the stairs above the caldera.",""
"55049764-2-4399","You're no fool to withhold your trust. Commendable, truly. But you'll go no further without my help.nnDestroy these bindings and free me!",""
"55049764-2-4400","I can sense the spirits with you, my friend.",""
"55049764-2-4401","Did the spirits talk to you? What did they say?",""
"55049764-2-4402","Find a way to kill <<1>> and I'll reward you handsomely.",""
"55049764-2-4403","Ho there! Shanked anyone lately?",""
"55049764-2-4405","My mother and brother are safe, and I have you to thank. Praise the Three they survived.",""
"55049764-2-4406","To duel is a blessing. It separates truth from untruth, yes?",""
"55049764-2-4407","No! Not father…nnHe was the best man I ever knew.",""
"55049764-2-4408","No words but her words!",""
"55049764-2-4409","Back away, outsider.",""
"55049764-2-4411","You're the help <<1>> sent? Looks like he finally did something right.nnWelcome. I'm Saervild Steel-Wind, Vicecanon Hrondar's deputy.",""
"55049764-2-4412","That can't have been an easy decision. Prisoners freed into the fens? Who knows what they'll do with their freedom?nnI received a message. The Dominion finally made their move against <<1>>.",""
"55049764-2-4413","I was trapped. I let myself get trapped. Perhaps I would even be dead. You changed that, friend.nnUnderstand: I'm grateful, but I also wish you had never found me.",""
"55049764-2-4416","You grow used to the ointment's smell after a while. You didn't get any in your eyes, did you? Good, good.",""
"55049764-2-4418","Made it out alive, I see. How did it go?",""
"55049764-2-4419","We're too late. The keepers have fallen.",""
"55049764-2-4420","Did you talk to Mavos?",""
"55049764-2-4421","Are you insane? Don't you know what taking those relics will do to the dreugh?",""
"55049764-2-4422","She speaks. She speaks!",""
"55049764-2-4423","We finally made it. I thought we were done for, once or twice.nnBefore you take the keystone, there's something you must know.",""
"55049764-2-4427","I think we have all the pieces. Place the skull with them to restore the reliquary.",""
"55049764-2-4428","Amazing work, my friend. Now Dithis and I can deconstruct the goblinization matrix and see where I went wrong. Perhaps some sort of magical attraction component was added by mistake. nnSo Dithis … do you feel pretty?",""
"55049764-2-4429","I've decided to leave Dithis as a Goblin for a few days. Hopefully, it will remind the brothers of what happens when they meddle in magic they don't understand.",""
"55049764-2-4430","I can't thank you enough for saving me from <<1>>. I'm going to suffer through this humiliation as long as I need to. At least I'm alive!nnAnd stop looking at me like that, Denthis.",""

"55049764-2-4433","Please, we must take the eggs to safety!",""

"55049764-2-4435","The box appears to be in fine condition.nnMay I?",""
"55049764-2-4438","The urge to plunge your hand in fire, to spill your own blood? My whisper in your ear, supplicant. Know that I made you the instrument of my will.",""
"55049764-2-4439","My cat wouldn't leave Ebonheart, I know he's here somewhere. If you find him, please bring him home!",""
"55049764-2-4441","I'm dry with apprehension, comrade. Everywhere, I smell musty rot.nnIt is different than the rot of the swamp. It makes my scales itch.",""
"55049764-2-4445","We haven't heard from my brother yet. I hope he is well.",""
"55049764-2-4446","Ah, my friend from Davon's Watch!. Interested in more work?nnI've located another rare vintage here in Ebonheart.",""

"55049764-2-4677","Two switches will shut these traps off. We need to hit them at the same time. nnGet the one on the far wall. I'll hit mine when you do.",""
"55049764-2-4678","According the spirit, you'll need to collect the north, south, and central runestones to gain access to Skyshroud Crater.",""
"55049764-2-4679","I can't thank you enough for saving me. I'm no milk drinker, but those bandits could have sent me to Sovngarde with the flick of a wrist.",""

"55049764-2-4702","I'll be honest, adept. I can barely stand to look at you. Sending an intelligent woman like Valaste off with that creature. But … I feel honor bound to offer you a final gift.",""
"55049764-2-4703","Ah! Good! You and I can have reasonable conversations. Shalidor's just too old and crotchety for me.",""

"55049764-2-5050","You're not that bad, for an outsider.",""
"55049764-2-5051","This one has not been to a Dwarven ruin in some time. It is not a problem for Aelif. The steam ruins her fur. The noise hurts her ears. nnIt's better that you go, comrade.",""
"55049764-2-5054","I can't wait to see those losers' faces!",""
"55049764-2-5055","There were too many of them. They overpowered me and tossed me in here.",""
"55049764-2-5057","Ah, you've arrived at just the right time. What I'm doing will concern you as much as it concerns me.nnWe're looking at an invasion.",""
"55049764-2-5058","You! You must listen to me!",""
"55049764-2-5059","Companions, workers, find them and save them. Who am I forgetting? Oh, right. Did I mention how grateful my sister Kireth will be to see your face?",""
"55049764-2-5060","Thank you. We can't let the Worm Cult accomplish their goal here. We'll keep these survivors safe until you return.",""
"55049764-2-5061","So. What did the notes say? No rush. Take your time.",""
"55049764-2-5062","I didn't expect this outcome, to be honest. But there, you've done what you set out to do and saved Finoriell.nnGood.",""
"55049764-2-5063","So many sacrifices this day! But look! Finoriell was saved!",""
"55049764-2-5064","Why are you talking to me now? Finoriell's safe! Talk to her!",""
"55049764-2-5065","You and Lara saved me. I would be nothing, forgotten! What would that be like, to be … unmade like that?",""
"55049764-2-5068","What're you hanging around here for? Leave while you can!",""
"55049764-2-5069","Follow Merric's instructions. He's the only one who knows how to make this weapon.",""

"55049764-2-5080","You've learned the tune, yes? Now we can move on to planning the performance.",""
"55049764-2-5081","You should talk to the boss woman. There's no returning to the Earth Forge for you.",""
"55049764-2-5082","We'll figure this out in time. Speak carefully. Let no one hear anything we've planned.",""
"55049764-2-5083","We'll deal with Thorulf later. In the meantime, I know our soldiers can hold the walls. nnStill. Dark Elves defend. Nords attack.",""
"55049764-2-5086","So Shalidor found you. I've been hoping to begin soon. nnThe first book has been translated. Are you prepared for Sheogorath's first test?",""
"55049764-2-5087","I'd just speak to him and get it over with. I don't trust him, but I'm sure he'll do you no harm. You are, after all, his instrument for the moment.",""
"55049764-2-5088","Violence is one of my favorite forms of madness.",""

"55049764-2-5109","So you broke the Reach's lock on the mine entrance, nice. We'll hold them out here if you take them on inside the mine.",""

"55049764-2-5387","Glad you made it out, Arrow. I'll make sure Dajaheel and Belron go up on the rolls in Mournhold. It's mad to think of all those people. Reduced to ink on parchment.",""

"55049764-2-5427","Right. Now that you've passed this along, I'll need to ask you to make for the docks. As a newcomer to the city, the Watch Captain will want to note your arrival.",""
"55049764-2-5428","What happens in the mine? This waiting wears on me.",""
"55049764-2-5429","I do hope she hasn't lost sight of her duties. That woman is too easily flustered.",""

"55049764-2-5861","What an obscure ritual. I've never seen its like. Seems Bakkhara was right, and the Canonreeve is no mere politician.nnPerhaps I wasn't wasted on this mission after all.",""

"55049764-2-5946","A bit rusty, but not bad! So funny, watching you mortals muck around with things you can't possibly understand.nnI'll be needing that back, now.",""
"55049764-2-5947","As I expected. <<1>> is hiding something, but I don't know what.nnGood thing we've already planned for this. Are you ready for a little subterfuge?",""
"55049764-2-5951","Can't wait to see the look on <<1>>'s face when I prank her this year.nnHello there, stranger! Having fun at the festival?",""
"55049764-2-5952","You have the <<1>>? This is going to be amazing!",""

"55049764-2-5958","You don't belong here.",""
"55049764-2-5960","Remember, get arms caches and bring to Khajiit out by the shoreline. He will have your money waiting for you.",""
"55049764-2-5961","Shame about Captain Helane. I hear even a touch of that poison gives you the runs for years, though. That'll keep me grinning.",""
"55049764-2-5968","The sergeant said Velyn Harbor would have fallen without you. Honor to meet youI'm the Green Lady. The, uh, the new one.nnI could use your help. The Drublog clan usually side with my people in times of war. We need to learn what changed.",""
"55049764-2-5970","Have you spoken to my father? We must hurry, with or without his blessing.",""
"55049764-2-5971","<<1>> told me she'd wait for the right champion at the upper arena's gates.nnGo and do what you must.",""
"55049764-2-5972","I'm surprised House Dres managed to do anything with the Ordinators on high alert. Not much gets past them, even when they're not looking for trouble.",""
"55049764-2-5974","Did you get it? I'm going to need that wine if this ruse is going to work.",""
"55049764-2-5978","Impressive.",""
"55049764-2-5979","I watched you fight. Impressive.",""
"55049764-2-5980","Soon. Soon you too will know of my greatness.",""
"55049764-2-5981","Tell Daljari you bested some brawlers. Then come back here so I can knock you around.",""

"55049764-2-5984","Bthzark is on the north side of the island. Neramo should be poking around the ruins.",""

"55049764-2-5996","What do you want?","Che cosa vuoi?"
"55049764-2-6001","Follow the road to the mine. I'll be right there.",""
"55049764-2-6007","You desecrate a few old graves, and already the Bretons are back to complain.nnNice work dealing with the cult. Warchief Tazgol will be pleased.",""

"55049764-2-6012","Let me do the talking, won't you?",""
"55049764-2-6013","These are troubled times in Stormhaven. nnI should be focused on the Daggerfall Covenant as a whole, but it would be unwise to neglect the threats to our home lest we lose that which we fight for.",""
"55049764-2-6014","I'll have this guillotine down and burned before the day's over. You have my word.",""
"55049764-2-6026","Please … you have to help. They're trapped. There's no help coming, and they don't know it.",""

"55049764-2-6048","The man is a pig. But then, aren't they all?",""
"55049764-2-6051","By the Empyrean Light. The Worm Cult brought his spirit back, didn't they? And you led him here.",""
"55049764-2-6052","I feel … free. It's as though a burden has been lifted from me, a burden I didn't know I carried.nnWhatever you did, it feels … right. When my memory returns, I'll find you and thank you properly for this.",""
"55049764-2-6054","Another day, another whipping. This job just gets better and better.",""

"55049764-2-6066","Khali … damn it. So strong, so forceful. So stupid when it comes to things like this. nnI suppose there's nothing else for it. We have to make for Dune.",""
"55049764-2-6067","You're a gift from the Stars. Once you're into the tunnels, Telenger should be easy to find. Do whatever it takes to get that old fool out of there.",""
"55049764-2-6068","Shazah … damn it. Why did she force me into this? nnI suppose there's nothing else for it. We have to make for Dune.",""
"55049764-2-6069","I should warn you, Gloo is a little … odd. But she's a damned genius when it comes to alchemy.",""
"55049764-2-6070","Good timing. We need to get some information out of our friend here. She seems pretty dense.nnI was just telling her how delicious I find silent tongues.",""
"55049764-2-6071","You're going to do great! Just, whatever you do, don't … err. nnYou know what? I forget. Probably wasn't important. Meet me at my workshop, northwest edge of the village, when you're done.",""
"55049764-2-6072","I wanted to pick up something nice for Captain Kaleen. Something to surprise her, like a new mug. But all this stuff is so expensive!",""
"55049764-2-6074","If the Countess is truly sick, I am more than a little bit concerned. nnI would not wish to remain in this village if she was not in charge.",""
"55049764-2-6078","We have sailed often to Betnikh these last years. Chief Tazgol is a gracious host. In many ways, this is my second home.",""

"55049764-2-6093","You journey into danger. Choose your steps carefully.",""
"55049764-2-6094","Bah, the dull claws on you. Do you have any idea how many coins you're leaving on the table?",""
"55049764-2-6095","Thank you. You have made a wise decision. The Bright Moons will sing your name for this.",""
"55049764-2-6099","Kalari will be all right, you will see. Just needs some time to deal with what has happened.nnGo, speak to Shuzura. She will want to hear from you.",""
"55049764-2-6101","You haven't finished serving everyone at the bar yet!",""
"55049764-2-6110","He came stalking back here, mad as a wet Khajiit. You'd better talk to him.",""
"55049764-2-6111","You smell like burnt corn. Is it done?",""
"55049764-2-6112","My, my. So the Arbordawn cult has been spun into Mephala's web. Fascinating. Worrying, to be sure! But fascinating.",""
"55049764-2-6113","Fivefold venerations upon you, traveler. What brings you to the Falinesti Autumn site?",""
"55049764-2-6114","Welcome to the Falinesti Autumn site. I'm with the team Telenger has brought. What brings you this way?",""
"55049764-2-6115","Welcome to the Falinesti Autumn site. Ghadar is working with the famed Artificer Telenger to study the site.",""
"55049764-2-6117","Don't worry. Tazia will not be moving. She has no interest in any kind of heroics.",""
"55049764-2-6118","That mapit marks the location of our treasures! Listen, I don't know how you got it, and I can't stop you from looking for those relics with these necromancers around, but if you find them, bring them to me.nnI'll make it worth your while.",""
"55049764-2-6120","Did you do it? Did you kill the Goblin king?",""
"55049764-2-6121","There's more to this plot than simply spreading chaos across the land. I won't rest until we uncover the truth behind this assassination attempt.",""
"55049764-2-6122","This is it! Either we break them or they break us!nnWhere is everyone? It's going to take more than just me!",""
"55049764-2-6123","Well? What did you find? Did he leave behind some papers, something to show what's going on in Shuzura's town?",""
"55049764-2-6124","I know we have just met, but you must listen to me. You must decide, do your duty. Destroy the circlet.",""
"55049764-2-6126","What are you still doing here? Shuzura will be wanting you there now, not when you feel like it.",""
"55049764-2-6127","Still waiting to hear why I need you.",""
"55049764-2-6128","You again? What's it this time?",""
"55049764-2-6130","Keep your eyes peeled. This place is crawling with surprises.",""
"55049764-2-6133","Hey there! You look like you don't have anything to do. The guy over there seems to be in dire need of help.",""
"55049764-2-6135","Why are you still here? Go away.",""
"55049764-2-6138","I honor you for bringing news of my brother's death. Now I know his fate, sad as it was.",""
"55049764-2-6140","Ha! I didn't think I'd ever find you. You move around.",""
"55049764-2-6141","What were you doing in the mine? And did you see a scummy Breton up there?",""
"55049764-2-6143","I'll take the Baron back to town with me. The magistrate will know what to do with him.",""
"55049764-2-6146","Ah! Thank Alkosh you found her! We've lost enough soldiers today without adding our best scout to their ranks. nnWith luck, the two of you will find more, yes?",""
"55049764-2-6147","What a day.",""
"55049764-2-6150","If you choose to destroy the relic, then you've turned your back on me and the Covenant. Make the right choice.",""
"55049764-2-6151","Did it go well? Do you have the samples?",""
"55049764-2-6152","Raz could not help but overhear. It is a terrible thing, to tell a person her father is gone.",""
"55049764-2-6153","He's badly hurt. I'll see if I can get him bandaged up.",""
"55049764-2-6154","Head to Moriseli, the Ayleid ruin to the north. Shaman Azlakha is already out there, and she may need help.",""
"55049764-2-6155","Chief Tazgol took the army to Carzog's Demise. Hurry if you want to actually kill any cultists.",""
"55049764-2-6156","I blacked out for a second, thought I died. Did you find the plant sap?",""
"55049764-2-6160","To think that my brother was afflicted by something similar to Sir Hughes … that's frightening indeed. nnI thank you for helping him. I still hope we're able to bring Sir Hughes to justice for what happened to my sweet Lakana.",""
"55049764-2-6163","What're you waiting for? Let's get rid of that pest!",""
"55049764-2-6164","I can't make Goblin's Delight without sugar leaf. Get it and I'll make you a treat you will never forget. Zich loves it!",""
"55049764-2-6174","You! How much more blood do you want?",""
"55049764-2-6177","Spare your blade, Orc. We have yielded to you.",""
"55049764-2-6179","Looks like you found his family. Maybe he isn't as full of Elf dung as I thought.",""
"55049764-2-6183","It's time. The people of Crosswych have taken up arms and are ready to retake their town.nnBut first, <<1>> must die.",""
"55049764-2-6186","We need this shore cleared to advance. Get these lamias off my beach!",""
"55049764-2-6187","My mistake cost my family their home and my people their lives. In my anguish, I sought to redeem myself.",""
"55049764-2-6191","I had my unit scale the sheer cliff behind us, and there was much complaining. The young are weak.nnYou, however, handled that Conduit Stone very well.",""
"55049764-2-6192","So the duchess got killed by one of those high-and-mighty knights?nnFolks like me, we liked herand now she's gone. I hope those knights get what's coming to them.",""
"55049764-2-6197","The ritual tore the veil between Nirn and Oblivion, allowing Mannimarco to begin stealing the souls his master needed to power the Dark Anchors and initiate the Planemeld.",""
"55049764-2-6198","The holy waters of Do'Krin have kept the Claw safe for years. I pray they keep you safe as well.",""
"55049764-2-6202","Why did you invade our island? We had no quarrel with you!",""
"55049764-2-6207","The thought of the dead walking around is unsettling at best. Soon they'll be shambling into Cropsford!",""
"55049764-2-6208","As soon as I know there's nothing in here, we can go. I have a feeling though. Keep looking around.",""
"55049764-2-6209","The spirits have vanished! Their valiant souls rest once again. Quickly tell me what you found below"," we have much to discuss."
"55049764-2-6210","I need to get these goods shipped to Daggerfall right away. So please, just leave me alone. nnNo offense, but our business is finished and I want nothing more to do with you.",""
"55049764-2-6211","Yes?","Si?"
"55049764-2-6212","Lord Diel is a miserable piece of work. I just hope my brother knows what he's doing.",""
"55049764-2-6214","I've got no love for the Covenant, but it is good to see a few more Orc faces in town.",""
"55049764-2-6216","I think the constable did the right thing. There's something shady about that knight. I've been watching her.",""
"55049764-2-6218","Indaenir's a real piece of work, isn't he? I always thought he was half-mad. They say he has ""the Green"" in his blood, but most things that man does, I just don't understand. nnRecently though, I've realized just how fortunate we are to have him.",""
"55049764-2-6219","The incessant clamor of the undead at the gate finally stops, and you come through the gateit is a relief to finally see someone new from among the living.nnIs Akkhuz-ri correct in thinking you have come to our aid?",""
"55049764-2-6220","Glad that's done. The pleading of the condemned is almost too much to bear. One way or another, they are returned to the Forest.",""
"55049764-2-6222","That's what the Orcs want, a fight? We could have resolved this hours ago! Though I suppose the captain's not too keen on killing our new friends.",""
"55049764-2-6223","I'm just going to assume at this point that S'rashi's giving me a break. True or not, that's what I'm going with. nnMeans I can head back to the ship …. Well, maybe just one more drink first.",""
"55049764-2-6225","Go on, the guards are always good to give a sound beating.",""
"55049764-2-6226","That was unexpected.",""
"55049764-2-6227","First time an outsider's ever beaten me.",""
"55049764-2-6233","That banner has no place in Vlastarus. You know what you need to do.",""
"55049764-2-6235","You have taken many steps along the Path already, Hallowed. Jone and Jode have shown me … just a few more to go.",""
"55049764-2-6236","You made it! I wasn't sure if you would. I haven't had a drink in days, but if you've got the ingredients I need, it's time to celebrate!",""
"55049764-2-6240","Why isn't … why isn't he breathing? nnOh gods, we're too late.",""
"55049764-2-6241","The fighting sounded rather brutal from down here.  You're still in one piece though, so I'll take that as a good sign.",""
"55049764-2-6243","This guar gives its life so we may have meat. Now, I give you my time. Why?",""
"55049764-2-6246","When I leave this place, I will need all my strength. I thank you for my life.",""
"55049764-2-6247","Did you get my lute from <<1>>?",""
"55049764-2-6248","Stretch your tail here in peace.nnWhat brings you to the Hatching Pools?",""
"55049764-2-6250","Been to Crosswych, eh? We'll have the Red Rooks on the run soon enough.",""
"55049764-2-6251","What took you so long?",""
"55049764-2-6252","I'd never seen Sai's proving grounds before. It must have been a serene place before the attack.",""
"55049764-2-6253","I suspect that Vardan died when the portal closed. The body cannot survive without the soul.",""
"55049764-2-6254","You have a container, good. Are you ready for what's next?",""
"55049764-2-6255","This place is pretty impressive.",""
"55049764-2-6257","I need you to listen to me.",""
"55049764-2-6258","This thing must be destroyed!",""
"55049764-2-6261","Don't mind Marius. He was ordered here to look after the interests of the Empire. But really, all he cares for is his own advancement.",""
"55049764-2-6266","Quickly, Hallowed. Close the portal! Sealing it should draw the beasts back to Oblivion.",""
"55049764-2-6269","More wounded arrive by the hour. I hope you have good news for me.",""
"55049764-2-6270","Use the visions as guides, not shackles. Your fate is yours to determine.",""
"55049764-2-6273","Hmph. You've impressed even me. The Dominion owes you yet another debt.",""
"55049764-2-6275","Leave me alone.",""
"55049764-2-6276","You're looking for Sir Hughes, aren't you? Get in line. We've been waiting for him to come and clarify our orders for days. nnHe returned all right. But mumbling incoherently. Know what that means? Just more confusion. I think Hughes has lost it.",""
"55049764-2-6279","I wonder what's taking Jakarn so long? I wouldn't keep a girl like me waiting.",""
"55049764-2-6281","Curse Jakarn! How does he slip about so easily? I turn my back for one moment and he's gone.nnHe's probably off with those slatterns from Stros M'Kai. If I find any of them, it won't be pretty.",""
"55049764-2-6282","You have no idea how long I've waited to taste a good Orcish brew! That swill the Redguards call beer has less kick than a mudcrab.nnNow, if only Lambur would join me.",""
"55049764-2-6284","At last, I find myself looking forward to my future.",""
"55049764-2-6285","The Bright Moons smile down upon us, traveler. The Claw is safe.",""
"55049764-2-6286","You have returned! Bright Moons be praised! Do you … do you have the relics?",""
"55049764-2-6287","I respect the captain, but I won't set foot on an island full of Orcs.",""
"55049764-2-6288","Well, I'm considering waiting til we get out to sea, then throwing you over. I can barely stand the sight of you.",""
"55049764-2-6290","I lost my best daggers when the Maiden's Breath ran aground. I'm going to pick up something new, but the question is what?nnDo I need a new dagger or a trusty mace? Depends on what we're killing, I suppose.",""
"55049764-2-6291","I don't trust these Orcs. Their chief refuses to join the Covenant. No idea why.",""
"55049764-2-6292","I'm … I'm the Mane! Hallowed, we survived!",""
"55049764-2-6301","Hallowed, thank you for dispatching that treacherous Urcelmo. I … have to admit, I'm going to make jokes at his expense for years off this.",""
"55049764-2-6302","Sholg says you talked Lokra out of her wild ideas. You honor our clan. She will be an asset to her people.",""

"55049764-2-6317","Hunal's commentary on your progress has been … most interesting, Hallowed. I hope seeing me alive and well is not too distressing.",""
"55049764-2-6318","I'm sorry, Hallowed. The words of the Moon Bishop have affected me greatly. The thought of my people gone feral, my Silvenar dead ….",""
"55049764-2-6319","Hunal tells me you've already progressed well along the path. You continue to impress me, Hallowed.",""
"55049764-2-6320","ON the agony! The affront to our faith and our people!",""
"55049764-2-6321","They have some interesting brews here, don't you think?",""
"55049764-2-6327","The Covenant moved in when they took Drakelowe. As long as they don't make me work, we'll get along.",""

"55049764-2-6695","Beg your pardon! This is a private residence. Where are my guards?",""
"55049764-2-6697","Z'en's sweet mercy! We did it! The serpent's bound again! nnFirst off, I have to say I'm sorry to the gods for ever doubting them. Second, I promise I will never say that guard duty is beneath my abilities again. Never!",""
"55049764-2-6698","Please return quickly with the tools. If I can't trade them for medicine, this one's father will die.",""
"55049764-2-6699","Want to buy a carpet? How about three? They aren't good for much else.nnYes, <<1>>, even you!",""
"55049764-2-6700","This one hopes the people may be forgiving. Akkhuz-ri can't expect a warm welcome.",""
"55049764-2-6701","Thank you! This one thought we were done for after <<1>> sentenced us to death.nnHow do we get out of the Hall of Judgment? They're not going to let us simply walk out of here.",""
"55049764-2-6702","You've got to let us out!",""
"55049764-2-6703","You've got to help us!",""
"55049764-2-6705","This one will get Kargand the help he needs.",""
"55049764-2-6706","You need to use the book now. Cast the ritual! Don't worry, I turned it to the right page. You won't be annihilating worlds or anything.",""
"55049764-2-6707","Did Marcella send you? Please! Get me out of here.",""
"55049764-2-6711","Please! You've got to help me get out of here! Those crocodiles look hungry.",""
"55049764-2-6716","Peace be upon you, wayfarer. I am relieved to see a survivor from the docks. The news we have received is grave indeed.",""
"55049764-2-6717","I shall return to the council. We have many plans to put in placeboth to assist you in your cause and to prepare for our return to Valenwood.nnGood luck, outsider. And thank you.",""
"55049764-2-6728","If this place remains open, as has yet to be determined, the Clan Mother should hire you in a more legitimate capacity.",""
"55049764-2-6729","You are thrice lucky, but you will never best Ishalga!",""
"55049764-2-6733","What are ye doing here?  I told ye this is sacred ground. How did ye even get past the barrier?",""
"55049764-2-6734","All right, you've had enough time. Where's the skooma?",""
"55049764-2-6735","Thank you. S'rendarr himself would commend your actions.nnGive me the skooma so I can destroy it. I want to finish what I started.",""
"55049764-2-6736","The troops have secured the Chasm. Thanks!",""
"55049764-2-6737","Caretaker Henodras is passing the mantle to Erunor at the Fading Tree now. Hurry!",""
"55049764-2-6738","We will stay here to protect the priestess from the bandits, in case you drive any of them out.",""
"55049764-2-6739","I'm terribly worried about my comrades. Especially my brother Veranus. Mother would never forgive me if I returned to Bravil without him.",""
"55049764-2-6740","Mara bless you, child. Did one of my temple guards send you this way?",""
"55049764-2-6741","Ah, it is my most pleasant and clever friend. Zur is happy to see you again!nnThis Hollow City, it is nice, yes? Gadris would have liked this place. I learned much from our time together. Zur keeps better notes, now. Very neat. Less doodles.",""
"55049764-2-6742","It is nice to see you again, friend. I find the accommodations in this city to be most pleasing.nnI can't help but imagine that Zur would have taken great delight in this place. I think of him often.",""
"55049764-2-6743","We must be ever vigilant. Daedra can be as devious as dark clouds on a sunny day.",""
"55049764-2-6744","You've got to destroy all four of the focus crystals in order for us to open the portal.",""
"55049764-2-6745","Sorry I missed the fight with Molag Grunda. I got distracted by a veritable flood of Dremora. I was up to my ankles in Winged Twilights and was having a grand old time!",""
"55049764-2-6747","Go on in, don't keep the Captain waiting.",""
"55049764-2-6749","Go, walker. Repair and learn.",""
"55049764-2-6753","Bright moons. Jone and Jode shine down on us, even now.",""
"55049764-2-6756","We're almost done. Just destroy those totems.",""
"55049764-2-6757","Thank you, Hallowed. You've filled your role admirably, as hundreds of Moon Hallowed have done before you. You have the thanks of all who praise the Bright Moons.",""
"55049764-2-6759","Only the dead and the desperate end up in this part of the desert. You appear to be neither, so you must be a very brave soul. nnDo you intend to enter the cursed grounds, the Tears of the Dishonored?",""
"55049764-2-6761","So, we meet in person at long last. You looked taller in your projection.",""
"55049764-2-6765","I erect the spine of caution. Adalmor is not the most patient of Nords. Perhaps there are no patient Nords.",""
"55049764-2-6766","Go onrepair one of those siege weapons.",""
"55049764-2-6767","Just stick with the training, soldier.",""
"55049764-2-6770","Go ahead, use that repair kit.",""

"55049764-2-6784","What … what are you? Are you real?",""
"55049764-2-6787","Hm?",""
"55049764-2-6789","You heard Father, yes? We must pray at the lunar shrines to learn more of his … my past. Let's do it.",""
"55049764-2-6790","Mother said we should pray at the shrines, see more of her past. Come, Hallowed. Let's do it.",""
"55049764-2-6791","We have accomplished great things this day, my faithful friend!",""
"55049764-2-6792","I'm so glad you could come! My parents will be back tonight, and I was afraid I'd have to face them alone again.",""
"55049764-2-6793","This is my test. If I can take the life of this girl, it means that I'm willing to make the necessary sacrifices.",""
"55049764-2-6794","Gifted with a rare and powerful ability, Aranias tried in vain to win her parents' affection.",""
"55049764-2-6795","Peace be upon you, comrade. Good to see you at my little meeting.",""
"55049764-2-6796","By the Divines, it's good to see you here.",""
"55049764-2-6797","You look formidable, comrade. Perhaps one day you'd care to spar with Ra'zaym, yes?",""
"55049764-2-6798","Ahh, so nice to be holding this meeting in Skyrim. Perhaps later we can go for a run out to one of the dragonshrine ruins! Always a good fight, draugr.",""
"55049764-2-6799","You must be the one Merric and Aelif have been talking about. Finally we get some movement around here.",""
"55049764-2-6800","What news do you have?",""
"55049764-2-6801","Our customs and our traditions … these are the things that sustain us in this foul land.",""
"55049764-2-6802","I toil and sweat, but this foul land provides few bounties.",""
"55049764-2-6803","I often deal with the unknown in my role as a go-between and agreement broker.",""
"55049764-2-6804","I am most grateful for your help. Casnar's brother, Enneh, will be at his market stall. The wedding offended him so greatly, he had refused to attend.nnWhether he knows what happened to Casnar or not, let us hope we can soon put the matter to rest.",""
"55049764-2-6805","Congratulations. The path is over. The moons shine their light upon you once again.",""
"55049764-2-6806","None have entered the vault save you and the vicereeve. I have confirmed it.",""
"55049764-2-6807","You again?  You seem to make a habit of showing up just when things are getting properly twisted.",""
"55049764-2-6808","This one will never complain about a job again.",""
"55049764-2-6810","We were lucky to make it back here alive. Those Dawnmead are … they're monsters. Thank you for getting the relics back here.",""
"55049764-2-6811","Somebody here must know why <<1>> has gone bad. Ask around. Discreetly.",""
"55049764-2-6813","Be mindful of your step. This forest has been most unkind to guests.",""
"55049764-2-6814","I really appreciate you helping me out with this wolf situation.",""
"55049764-2-6815","I can't believe they're dead. Glad … glad you could bring the relics back, traveler. Make their sacrifice worth something.",""
"55049764-2-6816","The pillars seal the gateway. Unlock them with the keys.",""
"55049764-2-6817","Use the keys on the pillars and we'll be on our way to Moonhenge. Well, this Moonhenge. Confusing, isn't it?",""
"55049764-2-6818","Those bastards killed Patraud, for little more than stepping into the clearing. I'll be sure to return the favor to these Bosmer savages.",""
"55049764-2-6819","When inspecting all the claws of this plan, this one is not so sure it will work.",""
"55049764-2-6820","We'll find out what we need to know.",""
"55049764-2-6821","I'd be lying if I said I liked Patraud much. The Apprentice never knew when to shut his mouth, but he didn't deserve to die like that.",""
"55049764-2-6822","That Bosmer we … captured mentioned a matriarch named Selene.",""
"55049764-2-6824","By the Egg, those Bosmer were vicious. I won't forget Patraud's sacrifice.nnLet's hope there's research worth doing in this forest.",""
"55049764-2-6826","Told you I'd make it back, didn't I? Not going to let something like a little gutwound stop me. No way.",""
"55049764-2-6827","Honor and praise, my friend. Do you have the Staff of Magnus?",""
"55049764-2-6828","I'm sorry. Only Forebears are allowed in today. We do welcome guests on some occasions, so I hope you will return at another time.",""
"55049764-2-6829","I know you are a guest in our city, wayfarer, so I will forgive your ignorance, but the fellowship hall is open to Crowns only.",""
"55049764-2-6830","Do not worry, I will not get in your way. I like keeping I's head on I's neck.",""
"55049764-2-6831","Accompany Evoker Ahainar-jo. He will attempt to contact the Bosmer again. Perhaps they will tell us how to contact the spirit of this forest.",""
"55049764-2-6832","Greetings, Crown. nnBy Stendarr's grace we have summoned the strength to forgive you for your trespasses.  I hope you will afford us the same courtesy.",""
"55049764-2-6833","Don't you have your own dead to tend to in the Crown quarter? nnLeave us to our grief and we shall do the same for you.",""
"55049764-2-6834","You have our condolences, Forebear. We have asked Tu'whacca to take up your dead. No Redguard should face such defilement.",""
"55049764-2-6835","Thank you. You have no idea what it means for me to see Lorwen alive. And our project fulfilled. You've saved us.",""
"55049764-2-6836","May Ruptga's blessings fall upon the wayfarer who uncovered the truth about our inglorious Magistrate. Crown justice prevails once again.",""
"55049764-2-6837","Greetings, sera. Distrust runs deep here in the Alik'r, but you are most welcome in our Guildhall.",""
"55049764-2-6839","<The imperial is still dead. He will likely continue to be dead for several years.>",""
"55049764-2-6842","We must stop them from destroying my island.",""
"55049764-2-6843","I thank you. If you are braving the cellars further, I would ask again for your help. On behalf of all my people.",""
"55049764-2-6847","What foulness is afoot now? The dead have risen? I thought Alasan was purposefully not raising them!nnWere we too late? Has Alasan made himself into a lich?",""
"55049764-2-6854","I really miss my lute, F'lah.",""
"55049764-2-6858","Hunal has been giving us a running commentary of how it's going in there. Truly, your vision showed me falling to Urcelmo's blade? Raz thinks Jone and Jode do not know him very well.",""
"55049764-2-6860","I can't work under these conditions! I'm not built for war!",""
"55049764-2-6870","Remember, the beacon at the lighthouse will be our signal to move in. Light it once you've completed your task. We will descend upon the Maormer at that moment and crush them.",""
"55049764-2-6873","Leave me alone. Let me die here.",""
"55049764-2-6876","Thanks to you, my soul is back where it belongs.",""
"55049764-2-6877","Freedom is a wonderful thing. And I'm sure that dear Lady Laurent has missed me terribly. She really is lost when I'm not around to help her.",""
"55049764-2-6885","You work quickly and efficiently, young one. I appreciate that. nnDid you recover all the ship designs?",""
"55049764-2-6887","I prayed Tu'whacca would guide you.nnDid you find Zariya? I heard fighting amongst the dead … is she all right?",""
"55049764-2-6890","Don't tell anyone, but I've started sleeping under the desk. The streets are too dangerous at night.",""
"55049764-2-6892","I've a great deal of work to do, so please excuse me. nnI need keep busy. Keeps my mind off things.",""
"55049764-2-6894","Greetings, wayfarer. I'd ask you to report any rumors you might hear concerning disappearances to Justice Istah.",""
"55049764-2-6895","These disappearances have the Justice on blade's edge. Seek him out if you have any information to impart.",""
"55049764-2-6898","Hers is a sad story.",""
"55049764-2-6900","Ruptga's blessings upon you and your house, wayfarer. nnI apologize for the poor state of our streets. The recent unpleasantness in the wastes has brought an influx of Forebears from the westand you know how they are.",""
"55049764-2-6901","Fahara'jad's appointee is useless as a sundial in a sand storm. nnIf this is the best our Forebear king can send, he should abdicate.",""
"55049764-2-6902","You must be the person who rescued all these people. We were part of Vanus Galerion's group before … well, before everything fell apart.nnWe appreciate everything you've done for us.",""
"55049764-2-6903","Got me new bones yet?",""
"55049764-2-6904","My mother banished me to this Crown-infested hamlet with its absurd bumpkin nobility to ""cool my blood."" nnIt leads me to wonder if she already knew people were being kidnapped here.",""
"55049764-2-6906","I've not seen my son for some time. At first I thought he'd debauched himself into another stupor, but now … now I bear a father's worry.",""
"55049764-2-6910","You missed all the fun.",""
"55049764-2-6911","You have to get out of here before my babies find you. They'll tear you apart! This has never happened to me before. So many people are dead!",""
"55049764-2-6913","This hall is full of secrets. If you will hear advice, then hearkenleave Bergama now before you are caught in the jackal's snare.",""
"55049764-2-6915","If rumor is to be believed, a great many of the disappearances occurred near the gambling hall. I've been giving it a wide berth.",""
"55049764-2-6918","Hmm. You looking for a skull thumping? Keep walking, stranger.",""
"55049764-2-6919","You have returned. Did you ignore the instructions of the Champions as well? Raz hears that is something you do.",""
"55049764-2-6920","Let these petty man-thieves come for me. By Tava's red feathers, we will see this nonsense ended with a flick of my blade.",""
"55049764-2-6922","I knew we could count on you. You have never disappointed me. But there is so much left to do if we are going to win this war.nnStill, with you leading the charge, we have an excellent chance to end the Planemeld and save our world.",""
"55049764-2-6923","My friend! It's good to see you again. I'm thrilled I could persuade Urcelmo to trek out here. We need to support Akkhuz-ri and the Champions. This is a vulnerable moment for our fragile new Dominion.",""
"55049764-2-6925","Hey … hey. You wanna walk me home? I heard there are nasty folk out there, y'know? Dangerous! nnWhy's your face so fuzzy?",""
"55049764-2-6926","Hallowed. I hope you and these Champions won't take long. I worry about Her Majesty's security this far from Auridon.",""
"55049764-2-6927","I know that scent. Green keep you, my friend. The Silvenar and I are well pleased that we could be here to support the Khajiiti people.",""
"55049764-2-6928","My friend! Isn't this amazing? It's my first time on the borderlands of Valenwood. And my first time in a Khajiiti temple! I'm honored to be here today.",""
"55049764-2-6929","It's a shame about all these people going missing, but I tell you, it's great for business. Samhudah's paying me to stand here and make sure no one shady gets in. That's it. nnEasiest money I've ever made.",""
"55049764-2-6931","I've never seen a place like this in all my dreams.Unless we're in my dreams now. That's the only way it would make sense.",""
"55049764-2-6932","I hope to save enough gold to make the journey to Sentinel, but it's hard to come by in this stingy Crown village. They cling to their wealth like a goat kid to its nanny's teat.",""
"55049764-2-6933","I have something for you to do.",""
"55049764-2-6937","Ah, well met! Very well met, indeed! Allow me to welcome you to The Winking Jackal! If you should need anything, feel free to call out. nnOr, you know, throw something. That seems customary here.",""
"55049764-2-6939","The decision is yours alone, though you know what I believe is the best course to take.",""
"55049764-2-6945","Business has slowed to a tortoise's crawl since the disappearances started. nnMany of the missing were patrons of ours … friends, even. If you ask my opinion, this smells like Crown mischief.",""
"55049764-2-6946","Fair winds. Have you come to escape the sour looks as well?nnAs soon as people began to disappear, the guards went looking for the foreigners. I've taken refuge here to avoid harrassment. It's not all bad thoughI'm a fair hand at dice.",""
"55049764-2-6948","Deliver the mixture quickly. If the vampirism progresses too far, curing it becomes a far more difficult endeavor.",""
"55049764-2-6949","We'll both be happier with that altar smashed. You'll see!",""
"55049764-2-6952","All stories go on, even when your part is complete. There was a reckoning for Aranias and for the Wilderking himself, as you well know.nnNow, go where your story takes you. I will try not to interrupt it again.",""
"55049764-2-6953","Now remove the heart and there may be a chance we can grow a new one.",""
"55049764-2-6954","My friend! They hit me over the head and dragged me in here. Is Alanya safe?",""
"55049764-2-6955","If Andur kills me before I pass the mantle to Aranias, there will be no caretaker of the Valenwood. nnThe forest would become a voracious monster. It would turn against the Bosmer and ultimately bring about its own destruction. You must stop him.",""
"55049764-2-6957","The bundle of roots will pull you into the ground and let you pass under the fire.",""
"55049764-2-6958","Stick close to me, and I'll have that gate open in no time.",""
"55049764-2-6967","If you don't mind, I still have recruits to drill.",""
"55049764-2-6968","Please, go let Pircalmo know what's happened. I'll untie Alanya. We've made such a mistake.",""
"55049764-2-6969","You don't look like one of Gudarz's bruisers. What do you need?",""
"55049764-2-6971","Ranneth untied me? That means Pircalmo is safe, right? He did nothing wrong?",""
"55049764-2-6972","Take out <<1>> and his lackeys will take to the hills. Spineless bastards.",""
"55049764-2-6973","Pardon me, I have to go on sentry duty.nn…Which is a relief, with all these new low-lifes in camp.",""
"55049764-2-6974","A woman named Aranias endangers the whole of the Court of the Wilderking, you must stop her.",""
"55049764-2-6975","I have guarded this square long and long, wayfarer. Even so, I do not know what the Forebears might do about these disappearances. Best that a Crown abide here and keep watch.",""
"55049764-2-6977","Welcome to the Manor of Revelry. Let me know if you see anything you like.",""
"55049764-2-6978","Help me clear a path so we can get <<1>> out of here safely.",""
"55049764-2-6979","Look at you! Nothing but skin and bones! We really need to fatten you up before you wither away to nothing.",""
"55049764-2-6980","The manor is everything you hoped for, isn't it? But look at you! You could really use a bath.",""
"55049764-2-6981","<<1>> is kind of clumsy. He tripped and stumbled six times on the way down here. It's a wonder we weren't spotted.",""
"55049764-2-6982","I don't think I like you. And I don't think my friends will like you, either. nnBetter think about moving on.",""
"55049764-2-6985","I'm a Nordwhich means I'm moody, and prone to violence. Don't provoke me.",""
"55049764-2-6993","You must decide which companion to take on the initial assault. You need to travel light and move quickly, for speed is essential.nnEach of these soldiers has worked with you before. You know what each of them can do and who will serve you best.",""
"55049764-2-6994","Once you select the companion that will aid you in the initial offensive, let me know.nnAs soon as you're ready, we'll begin our assault.",""
"55049764-2-7004","The Fighters Guild came to Coldharbour for this express purposeto stop the Planemeld and save our world. nnNo matter how many of us fall this day, we shall not fail!",""

"55049764-2-7014","I enjoy a challenge as well as the next mage, but this might be a little much, even for me.nnStill, I'll do whatever I can to make sure our world isn't completely destroyed. While I grew up on the Shivering Isles, I now call Nirn my home.",""

"55049764-2-7072","We need to search the area for any information we can gather about the maormer's ritual. I'd start by looking in some of those ruined houses and examining a bodies lying around on the broken docks.nnMaybe a few survivors can answer questions, too.",""

"55049764-2-7112","Hey, I know you. Indaenir mentioned you. You've come along at just the right timeor I guess it's the wrong time. The forest that way is blighted. Indaenir's looking into it. I'm not supposed to let anyone through, but I can make an exception.",""
"55049764-2-7113","Ah, my friend! So good to see you again! Now that my head has cleared, the writing has been going very well. How went the relic hunting?",""
"55049764-2-7114","I'm hoping to compete in the Summoner Division. I finally learned to conjure wolves. Only took me three months of trainingand three lost fingers.",""

"55049764-2-7116","I would like to speak with you, but I must finish reading this first.",""
"55049764-2-7117","Everything is so … very different. It's like I'm no longer a single physical form, but my being is spread out across the forest.nnAranias is slipping away. You are my friend though, whoever I become. Will you stay for just a moment?",""
"55049764-2-7118","Wonderful! Thought I'd be yapping here for eternity. Blasted Wormies only have eyes for the empty ones.nnVery well, tie me to your belt and we can get started. No time to lose!",""
"55049764-2-7119","You'll find Ugorz in the Orc stronghold to the east, and Zirani in the Khajiit village in the west. Both were once-flourishing townshipsbut no longer. They'll need help to escape.nnI'll meet you all at the Overseer's overlook.",""
"55049764-2-7120","Nice! That'll show 'em!",""

"55049764-2-7123","I can't tell if you're crazy or daft, but you have my thanks.nnIf you can stop the Daedra at the other fronts, we should be able to hold here. I won't blame you if you fail or fleewe're prepared to defend our homes either way.",""

"55049764-2-7127","You-you are here? Thank the gods! We need you!nnThe third Ansei Ward is here. That girl Shirithe scholar's apprenticeshe is a necromancer and she has come to the necropolis. We have to stop her!",""
"55049764-2-7130","Do not linger here.nnThe living who wander in my realm tend to become … lost.",""
"55049764-2-7132","Welcome, stranger. I'm on the hunt, but you're not my quarry.",""
"55049764-2-7137","With Vanus and the Mages Guild to aid you, you've gained a strong advantage in this fight.nnDo not underestimate the power of Vanus Galerion. He's accomplished many great things during his lifetime.",""

"55049764-2-7140","You didn't hear anything, got it? Certainly not that I'd like to be his night blossom. Or anyone's! Especially not his! You didn't hear that!",""
"55049764-2-7141","My apologies, but I can't chat. Tholbor's given me an arm's length of tasks to do, including his filthy laundry. Horrible man, honestly.",""
"55049764-2-7142","My apologies. I'm all out of sorts. Malarel has a thousand tasks for me, and her idea of motivation is a lightning bolt to the forehead. I understand I'm the third assistant she's had in a month!",""
"55049764-2-7143","I'm the stage manager for the Swordmaster Division. If you hurry, you can make the next round of qualifiers. Credentials, please?",""
"55049764-2-7144","A moment.",""
"55049764-2-7145","Excuse me.",""
"55049764-2-7146","Raz wishes he could help. Naemon would not last long.",""
"55049764-2-7147","A moment. I want to watch this.",""
"55049764-2-7148","Pardon. This seems an important moment.",""
"55049764-2-7149","In a moment. Shazah would like to see this.",""

"55049764-2-7151","Sorry. I'd like to see this.",""
"55049764-2-7154","Not only did I witness the choosing of the Silvenar, I also got to see the Heart of Valenwood. It's really been quite an extraordinary day.",""
"55049764-2-7156","Don't interrupt.",""
"55049764-2-7157","This looks important.",""
"55049764-2-7158","We've been away from the central barrier long enough. Gilraen and the others will need my healing. Let's hope they're not dead.",""
"55049764-2-7159","By the Green Pact those Daedra were powerful! nnI fear what Gilraen and the others are facing at the central barrier. Perhaps we should return to help.",""
"55049764-2-7160","Honor and Faith are due all, but you who have come from afar … your contribution is matched in measure only by the length of your journey.nnThank you.",""
"55049764-2-7161","We have to keep the Sea Vipers out of <<1>>. We must hurry.",""
"55049764-2-7173","If not for your little challenge gambit I'd have killed you by now. Get on with the fight before I change my mind.",""
"55049764-2-7179","My sword-arm hangs loose in the socket like a sagging palm frond. If you have come here to train, I suggest you find a lighter sword.",""
"55049764-2-7194","I thought we were safe here. Hidden from the enemy. The God of Schemes grows more powerful by the day!",""
"55049764-2-7198","I'll just stay here for a while longer. I should whisper a prayer to Y'ffre for my fallen brothers. nnThank you once again.",""
"55049764-2-7202","You're a strong one, aren't you? Khuzi likes the strong ones.",""
"55049764-2-7208","You got Ansei Maja's Ward? Wonderful! Why don't you hold onto it this time …?nnYou need to get the other Ward too, the one Throne Keeper Farvad was carrying. Go on! I'll find you later.",""
"55049764-2-7211","What have I done? What have I done? I have struck down one of our ancestors!nnI have betrayed my vows, my people, my god. Tu'whacca! How could you allow me to do this?",""
"55049764-2-7212","You can talk to them. The fine people inside, where the skies can't be seen. Go on, they're near.nnThey're all near. Above. Below. Who'll protect us from them?",""

"55049764-2-7215","I've never seen anyone fight like that.nnI mean, you should go.",""
"55049764-2-7216","Anyone could defeat you, with enough training.",""
"55049764-2-7217","Luck is not victory. Watch your back.",""
"55049764-2-7218","Winning one battle doesn't make you a true warrior.",""
"55049764-2-7219","I'm relieved to be out of the Tower of Lies, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to be out of this damned place altogether.",""
"55049764-2-7220","We're far from the familiar sights of Stonefalls. But these perils we facethey're epic! They will sing songs of our glory long after we're gone.",""
"55049764-2-7223","You're looking for a High Elf woman? Yes, I saw one pass this way. Right into that strange cave. The one with the village that just appeared out of nowhere!",""
"55049764-2-7225","I stepped out for a moment, dispatched a dozen Dremora, then popped back in. Just wanted to make sure I had the opportunity to see you off.nnWell, off with you, then! So long! Toodle-oo! Don't forget to write! Ta-ta! Cheerio!",""
"55049764-2-7227","Have you found <<1>>? They can't have taken her far from here!",""
"55049764-2-7228","The Ash'abah need your help. Go to the Tears of the Dishonored to the east.nnI pray that my vision did not come too late.",""
"55049764-2-7229","The trail of the Senche begins at the bones of my fellow Hound. I barely escaped with my life, and his life escaped with his bones bared.",""
"55049764-2-7230","Did you find her? Please tell me you did … or at least, that you didn't lose the flute. It's the only memory of her I have.",""
"55049764-2-7231","I've always loved this part of the Chasm. So majestic. Takes your breath away, doesn't it? On occasion, quite permanently.",""
"55049764-2-7232","You really do need to go now. The tribe will return from raiding the Wood Orcs to check on me, and I don't want any bloodshed.",""
"55049764-2-7233","Nielas is back! Thank you! What of the others?",""
"55049764-2-7234","I'm safe. I'm safe. They can't hurt me here.",""
"55049764-2-7235","Go to the circle. I will draw Gorzesh out of his lair and lead him to you.",""
"55049764-2-7239","Good, I can't imagine the source of what's going on over there. Plus Girin went to scout the area. Don't let him flirt with you too much. He's more interested in his own … interests sometimes then the problem at hand.",""
"55049764-2-7242","Thank the gods the ship's stopped moving. I don't know if I can bear going to sea again.",""
"55049764-2-7252","Now that the Fighters Guild and Mages Guild have finally set up shop, maybe this place can return to some semblance of normal.",""
"55049764-2-7253","Fighters and mages can be a little rowdy, but I'd rather have the customers than the quiet any day!",""
"55049764-2-7254","I'm not sure who drinks morethe mages or the fighters!",""
"55049764-2-7255","Where did all these fighters and mages come from? They're eating me out of house and home!",""
"55049764-2-7257","No matter how far from home we might be, the Mages Guild always provides for its members.",""
"55049764-2-7282","I hate this so-called existence.",""
"55049764-2-7285","Welcome back to the Guildhall.nnThe sands of the Alik'r hide all manner of wonders. Have you found any to share with us?",""
"55049764-2-7286","I saw you eyeing my fire. It isn't very warm, but it's all we've got. Go find your own fire, stranger.",""
"55049764-2-7287","I wish we could take longer breaks, but the work never ends.",""
"55049764-2-7288","Escape? That's easy. nnWaiting for the right time to make your move? That's where the difficulty comes in.",""

"55049764-2-7299","We'll settle down here in Longhaven until we've fully rested up. Then maybe we'll hit those Argonians back and make them sorry they ever crossed us.",""
"55049764-2-7305","A contest? Grand! Go quickly, before the guards I tipped off arrive. It'd be a shame if they mistake you for the Artisan.",""

"55049764-2-7321","Let's see what Manthir has to say. Oh, I'm so excited!",""
"55049764-2-7322","These should fetch some good coin here in Woodhearth. Thanks again.",""
"55049764-2-7323","Like I said, I'll send troops to the necropolis as soon as I can spare them. nnUntil then, may the gods be with you and Prince Azah both.",""

"55049764-2-7474","Honor to you, Sera. Welcome to the Guildhall. I realize that our presence here in the temple is unconventional, but I'm afraid that our former hall was razed just recently. One does what one must, yes?nnWhat can I do for you?",""

"55049764-2-7527","Despite my myriad talents, I must maintain a supply train in this backwoods marsh.nnWe have excess stores. Feel free to peruse them, if you like.",""
"55049764-2-7528","Sorry, not doing any business today.",""
"55049764-2-7530","Tell the vampire that he has our support.nnFor now.",""
"55049764-2-7534","I won't beg, but I implore you to restore my son. I have waited so long for this moment.",""

"55049764-2-7537","Do you think Molag Bal actually reads this stuff? Er, sorry. Trying to help my brother find something useful here. But look at all these books!nnI always wondered what a Daedric Prince read at bedtime. Some of this stuff is pretty disturbing!",""
"55049764-2-7539","How could a spinner violate the Green Pact? Madness.nnOh. If you're hungry, the meat was untouched. So we can trade, if you want.",""
"55049764-2-7540","Things will be strange until we have a new spinner. I don't like how that feels, especially after such a potent violation of the Pact.nnBut it's good to be able to go back to business. If you want to trade, ask.",""
"55049764-2-7541","And so it ends. I pray that it has, at any rate.",""
"55049764-2-7542","You're not going to get all weepy with me, are you? I mean, I've got that stoic reputation to maintain ….",""
"55049764-2-7543","Honor and faith to you always, my friend. My part in this is over.",""
"55049764-2-7544","Yes, this will be close enough, I think. Are you prepared?",""
"55049764-2-7545","Eranas, really? I can hardly believe it. He was a good man. Well, he had his reasons, I guess. We all have our reasons.",""
"55049764-2-7547","You will not be sorry, my friend. I assure you that my days of aiding man-eating serpents are over!",""
"55049764-2-7548","Eranas was just a scapegoat, to distract us from their real intentions. Did you see what pattern his sigil made when it was destroyed? Ancient Ayleidoon for ""thorn,"" which is what the spinner was. A thorn in their side, so they plucked him out.",""
"55049764-2-7551","Amazing. The person in the village most in tune with the Green Pact somehow violated it.nnLike that never happens.",""
"55049764-2-7555","My priestess, returned to me at last. Long did she suffer in the clutches of Molag Bal, yet you have brought her to me.",""
"55049764-2-7556","A pretty stone, yes? But it will remain dull as an old torture puppet until you've filled it with Daedric souls.",""
"55049764-2-7557","Less talking now. More killing.",""
"55049764-2-7560","What are you waiting on? Find me another tear now so we can move on.",""

"55049764-2-7605","I didn't think anything short of my death would sate Gargak's bloodlust. We may still end up at each other's throats one day, but for the time being we can enjoy a little peace. We owe you much.",""
"55049764-2-7607","You obviously aren't a frightened refugee. Welcome to Camp Tamrith, a little slice of home in a hostile wilderness. It isn't much, but it's better than nothing.",""

"55049764-2-7650","Hmmph! I can't believe the king's being so over-cautious. I asked to borrow one of the Ansei Wards for a few days to study it, and he flatly refused! nnI'm still glad you got them back, of course … we make a pretty good team, I think.",""

"55049764-2-7659","Let them come! We're as ready for them now as we ever will be.nnI have all of Malacath's strength behind my axes - none of these toothless savages will topple me, now or ever!",""
"55049764-2-7660","I've killed a fair few of them today, but they just keep coming.nnFine by me. My arms aren't tired yet.",""
"55049764-2-7661","That's my home. Over there, the one on fire.",""
"55049764-2-7662","How could this have happened? This is our home! Evermore is just across the lake, and this is all we get?",""
"55049764-2-7677","Imagine, all these crates lying around and no guards in site. It's a real shame.",""
"55049764-2-7678","Don't worry. I'll make sure no dead men make off with this unattended cargo.",""
"55049764-2-7686","Shoo! Away with you! Stay out of my garden!",""
"55049764-2-7690","I hope you've not come looking for the queen. She's left all matters of state to Duke Renchant. I heard Her Majesty's tending to the indigent masses at the chapel.",""
"55049764-2-7692","She brought the book here. I followed, but it's a witches' covendozens of themtrying to use the book for some evil ritual. nnI'm just a novice. I should return to the guildhall in Hallin's Stand. If I'm not here when you return, meet me there.",""
"55049764-2-7694","Brave meeting. Mind your tongue in this place. Too many ears and not enough brains.",""
"55049764-2-7697","Forgive me for stating the obvious, but you're alive!nnWe heard some terrible noises in the caves below. What happened?",""
"55049764-2-7699","Amazing powers, you say? Well, I can't wait to test your theory and see what happens!",""
"55049764-2-7700","The ritual is prepared. Wyress Rashan assured me that you'd have the heart.nnAssuming you do, tell Rashan, and we can get on with it. We don't want the forest to suffer a moment longer than it has to.",""
"55049764-2-7701","Well … I expect you won't be returning any time soon to enjoy my sisters' hospitality, and I can guarantee we won't run into each other on some city street ….nnSo I guess this is goodbye then.",""
"55049764-2-7702","Good luck in locating <<1>>. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.",""
"55049764-2-7704","Such a shame about King Eamond and his son. Both of them were so dashing. Renchant is a very poor substitute.",""
"55049764-2-7707","I tell you, things grow darker here by the damn hour! nnReachmen are right down there! Came in by boat, took the lighthouse, and now they're crawling up in the woods to assess our defenses. And our orders are to just sit here and watch!",""
"55049764-2-7712","Must be nice to be able to travel between this realm and the physical realm. I'm stuck here. Yes. I'm stuck here.",""
"55049764-2-7715","Welcome back to the guildhall, my friend. nnThe history of Bangkorai is rich in lurid and bloody events. Have you brought us any regional books or journals?",""
"55049764-2-7716","Aha! I thought we were in for a bit of easy coin with this job until the queen said you were coming along. Now I know to expect danger.nnBring it on though. If the plan goes awry, that just means we get extra hazard pay.",""
"55049764-2-7717","Surprised to see me? Sounds like I already missed some interesting experiences. A Hagraven controlling crows? I want to see that!nnThis business has potential too. Of course, our part only comes into play if there's trouble. Let's hope there isn't.",""
"55049764-2-7719","The sky is beautiful! A little different to what I remember.nnBut the Walking City. I must find it, so I may finally return home.",""
"55049764-2-7720","We don't take kindly to strangers.",""
"55049764-2-7729","I would rather not speak to someone I don't know.",""
"55049764-2-7730","Glad to see new faces in the village. It gets lonesome seeing the same people, day in and day out.nnIf Kerbol doesn't mind, maybe you can stay a bit longer.",""
"55049764-2-7731","Head right up those steps to leave the village.",""
"55049764-2-7732","Well fought! Sai Sahan travels with worthy companions.",""
"55049764-2-7734","Go now, before the Goblins find you.",""
"55049764-2-7736","Do you mind? I'm trying to have a quiet moment to myself here.",""
"55049764-2-7745","Reynelle was a kindly oneshe entered these Vaults with us, and I'd like her to leave with us, if the Mad Architect hasn't scattered her soul across Oblivion.",""
"55049764-2-7746","We long for freedom.",""
"55049764-2-7747","Now! The heart!",""
"55049764-2-7748","So, we're to stumble blindly into the catacombs beneath a crumbling ruin abandoned for an age? Lovely. That bearded idiot swordmaster will lead us straight into a trap, no doubt.",""
"55049764-2-7752","The Wyrd expect an alliance now after they murder my daughter in cold blood? They're lucky I don't have them all killed here and now!",""
"55049764-2-7753","I can't wait until this war is over. After this, I'm due for a vacation.",""
"55049764-2-7754","I'm in your debt for finding me. Elgenie says I'm going to be fine. I think Abir was more relieved than I was.",""
"55049764-2-7756","I'm not sure what you're hoping for with the girl, but I can tell you, she won't leave this ruin.",""
"55049764-2-7757","The captain will soon realize the right decision was made.",""
"55049764-2-7758","So those abominations the Dark Witnesses are herding about were once people like you and me. You should speak to Delphique. She may have something to say on this.",""
"55049764-2-7760","Perfect! One of Elgenie's I bet. This will do nicely.nnOnce you've destroyed the stores, use what's left of the poultice. It'll let you return to camp safely and quickly.",""
"55049764-2-7762","Happy to hear that <<1>> has been destroyed, but it's a terrible sad thing, what happened to Crestshade and Camp Tamrith.",""
"55049764-2-7763","Already the woods are defiled by habitation such as this. We can never recover.",""
"55049764-2-7764","Think of the glory! It'll be just like Ranser's War! We'll rescue Rivenspire and the women will swoon. It'll be great! You'll see. nnGo on to Shornhelm's chapel and tell Countess Tamrith I recruited you to the cause. I'll be along as soon as I can.",""
"55049764-2-7765","Well, that went better than expected! Not one breach of our perimeter! Guess those Baandari are good at something more than just swindling … ah, I shouldn't have said that. nnThe Knights of Saint Pelin are indebted to those cats. To you, too.",""
"55049764-2-7768","You have shown me more kindess than I deserve. I shall spend my remaining days attempting to atone and truly honor my son's memory.",""
"55049764-2-7771","Hmm. Well, there is a thing about the poultices. We do not have them just yet. nnThe good news is that I had foreseen the need for them, so I sent our herbalists out to gather what they needed. But … they haven't returned yet.",""
"55049764-2-7781","This is all the fault of the Bretons! We've been perfect neighbors, and this is the way they treat us? It's deplorable!",""
"55049764-2-7782","They took my brother. It was the Bretons. I'm sure it was.",""
"55049764-2-7785","I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about. I feel much safer now that the Fell's Brigade is here.",""
"55049764-2-7787","These Bretons are always so quick to blame others. It's a wonder they even get along with themselves.",""
"55049764-2-7790","Tell the most honorable guard how you heroically drew your weapon before chasing after that mangy cur!",""
"55049764-2-7791","Ah, you must be <<1>>'s agent.",""
"55049764-2-7792","We dislodged House Montclair from its nest. The upper city is ours and Shornhelm is free.",""
"55049764-2-7794","I can't believe that Baron Montclair would order the brazen kidnapping of Shornhelm nobles. Even if it was his general, this Reezal-Jul, who carried it out, Montclair is at the root of it. I am shocked.",""
"55049764-2-7802","<<1>> has accepted you, then? Good. We need all the help we can muster.",""
"55049764-2-7803","If they don't stop yelling at each other, I may just have to grab a switch and tan some hides. That'll give them something to cry about!",""
"55049764-2-7804","Deepswimmer doesn't fear alligators, but he fears trolls!nnThanks for saving this one's hide!",""
"55049764-2-7805","<<1>> sent you? She thinks, perhaps, you can do work for us? Who are you to know so little, yet offer so much?",""
"55049764-2-7809","Remarkable! What a strange sensation of new recollections and old. I believe that Reezal-Jul somehow removed those moments from my memory. But you were able to restore them.nnAnd now you understand what we are facing.",""
"55049764-2-7810","I know we're having problems, but I'm certain that Constable Agazu can handle it. Why the mayor allowed the militia to mobilize is beyond me.nnIt's like we're under martial law. And they closed the inn! What happens when I want a drink? What?",""
"55049764-2-7811","Are you as hungry as I am? I'm completely famished. The thrill of battle does that, you know. And flirting with death makes food taste so much better too.nnWe'll have to have a feast later. Yes, when the garrison's cleaned up.",""
"55049764-2-7813","Ah, sweet-bringer! Thank you for your kindness! You have saved me from many sleepless nights!",""
"55049764-2-7814","You look like someone who appreciates the finer things in life. I'm afraid that's in short supply right now.",""
"55049764-2-7815","Friend, you. Grateful.",""
"55049764-2-7818","Hey thanks again for all that stuff! It'll really help, you know?",""
"55049764-2-7819","Won't forget your service. Means a lot.",""
"55049764-2-7821","So much pain, it's … it's too much.",""
"55049764-2-7822","If only we had the full force of the Mages Guild behind us. These Reachmen wouldn't last long.",""
"55049764-2-7823","Walker … we may never be able to repay you for what you have done, but thank you.nnMay you dance with Jone and Jode until the end of days!",""
"55049764-2-7824","Have you heard the story of the shipwrecked Argonian? He swam from Summerset to Bal Foyen in under an hour. When the messenger arrived with word of the shipwreck, he was warm in bed with a flagon of mead.",""
"55049764-2-7825","Thank you again for finding my lost Puddles. I'd be so lonely without her.",""
"55049764-2-7827","Can't believe it's come to this. I should be leading my clan out of the Strid right now.",""
"55049764-2-7828","These animated boneswhy do they seek to keep us from the relic? Are they the lingering remains of the Ayleids who once dwelled here, do you think?nnWell, they won't stop me. No matter what their reasons are, my cause is greater.",""
"55049764-2-7829","My dear friend, Verandis. I'm glad you're here. You've always been so good to our family.nnI … I never really thanked you for that.",""
"55049764-2-7830","Who invited you into our camp?",""
"55049764-2-7833","I'm going to do one last perimeter sweep and hold the north gate. Don't worry, if anything gets past us, I'll be there to help you.",""
"55049764-2-7834","What brings you into our midst?",""
"55049764-2-7835","Needless to say, this behavior is more than a little disquieting. Short temper is not one of Arkay's blessings.nnI will reserve judgment for the time being, but if he is corrupted … well, let's see what unfolds.",""
"55049764-2-7841","These fools tricked you into doing their bidding. So be it, this isn't the end of me.",""
"55049764-2-7843","Oh, hello again. I'm still waiting on a few more signatures before I can head back to Valenwood. But maybe they'd take some books instead. What've you got?",""
"55049764-2-7845","Are you a member of the Daggerfall Covenant? We need your help!",""
"55049764-2-7848","My fool of a husband can sell apples. I see an opportunity that'll make me rich!",""
"55049764-2-7849","Are you all right? Crazy Eye saw you fall! She was worried you might not get back up!",""
"55049764-2-7850","Be careful. We've been raided by Imperials for days now. Are you here to help us rebuild the camp?",""
"55049764-2-7851","<<1>> said you're headed off to kill more bandits. Keep good count, all right? I bet him it would be less than a dozen.",""
"55049764-2-7852","Dark anchors here, now? The Daedric Prince Molag Bal is surely making his presence known in Bangkorai.",""
"55049764-2-7853","I'll always treasure Dame Marcelle's sword. Perhaps it will encourage me to take up a life of honor and adventure.",""
"55049764-2-7856","Of course, the Fangs! It all makes sense now. Blessed Almalexia had a vision that the Prince of Schemes had sunk his teeth into the ground at Gil-Var-Delle.nnThe fangs she saw in her vision must be the devices Meva described.",""
"55049764-2-7857","Greetings, guild-brother. How may I help you?",""
"55049764-2-7858","Fight now, talk later.",""
"55049764-2-7860","<This bottle seems out of place, balanced on a dagger. Something seems to be inside.>",""
"55049764-2-7861","I've had it right about up to here with the Bitterhands! This has to end.nnAdusa has put much thought into this.",""
"55049764-2-7862","Good luck out there. The Blacksap are a violent bunch.",""
"55049764-2-7863","You did well, my friend. Adusa would fight at your side any time.",""
"55049764-2-7864","You should get back to <<1>> as soon as possible. He'll want to hear what we found.",""
"55049764-2-7865","Nice work. We'll get this information to the rest of the Ravenwatch as soon as I meet my contact.",""
"55049764-2-7866","Nice work. We'll get this information to the rest of the Ravenwatch as soon as I meet my contact.",""
"55049764-2-7867","Nice work. We'll get this information to the rest of the Ravenwatch as soon as I meet my contact.",""
"55049764-2-7868","I do not seek to offend you, but … you look like troublethe kind of trouble we do not need in Fell's Run right now.nnI would suggest you simply leave town. There is nothing for you here.",""
"55049764-2-7870","Leave me alone. I'm only here for the wine.",""
"55049764-2-7871","You can always look, dearie, but don't touch. I'm a barmaid, not a trollop.",""
"55049764-2-7874","What do you say? You interested in having a bit of a laugh?",""
"55049764-2-7880","I suppose a public trial is for the best. If anyone learns we're holding <<1>> and his sons, it might rally support for another rebellion.nnAt least with a trial, there's an end to this conflict.",""
"55049764-2-7881","Can I ask your help? My husband and our dog are missing. I can see the red eyes of the undead from here. I'm worried … we're both capable with a blade, but he's no match for the undead.",""
"55049764-2-7883","<<<1>> makes a sad sound as he looks to the north.>",""
"55049764-2-7884","What a dreadful place you've discovered. When you want to return to Northpoint, just let me know.",""
"55049764-2-7887","Find my knights and bring back Arkay's relics. They are our only hope now against the dead tide.",""
"55049764-2-7889","That's the first time I've seen Queen Arzhela in the castle in days! nnThe people love her so much. I hope she returns to the throneit would be so good for the economy … assuming we don't get slaughtered by the Reachmen, of course.",""
"55049764-2-7890","Take as much time as you like, my friend. nnIt's only the High King and the entire kingdom of Rivenspire waiting.",""
"55049764-2-7891","Burying corpses once they begin to stink is one thing, but when they've been in a damp cave for days? It's like eating hot stew on a summer day. No one likes that.",""
"55049764-2-7892","Take care of that crown, it means a lot to the people of Rivenspire",""
"55049764-2-7894","I'm glad my sons are alive and safe. I just wish they would stop bickering.",""
"55049764-2-7895","I respect the High King's decision, but I can't hold my tongueI have serious doubts about Queen Eselde's ability to rule.nnI hope she proves me wrong, or all of Rivenspire will pay the price.",""
"55049764-2-7896","I respect your decision, and that of the High King, of course. I will do all I can to support King Alard.nnI do worry about his militaristic tendencies, though.",""
"55049764-2-7897","You draw ever closer. Graccus holds my book, the Oghma Infinium, in the ruins below.",""
"55049764-2-7898","I almost feel sorry for young Dorell. Almost. But I learned long ago, if you're going to drink to excess, you have to face the consequences.",""
"55049764-2-7899","You've returned. What have you found?",""
"55049764-2-7900","I heard you and the Prophet talking about Abnur Tharn.",""
"55049764-2-7901","Nice work, ""Hallowed."" I hope your visions weren't too frightening.",""
"55049764-2-7902","Balance will be restored before too long, I think! With laurels, wine, and crushed velvet lining, yes?",""
"55049764-2-7903","Have you secured a meeting with <<1>>?",""
"55049764-2-7904","I'm not selling anything, friend. You'll have to go inside and talk to Sabir.nnMy part in this business is in acquiring the items we sell and managing relations with our partners.",""

"55049764-2-7919","Hallowed. Strange to refer to you by that title after everything else you've done for the Dominion. But then, I suppose this was ordained in the moonlight, yes?",""
"55049764-2-7921","This one is humbled to stand before the Moon Hallowed. You have done so much for Akkhuz-ri's people … more than he has done in some time, he thinks.",""
"55049764-2-7922","Who are you? You don't look like a skeever.",""
"55049764-2-7923","I signed on with the Shornhelm Guard because Baron Dorell is a man of action. He's someone who gets things done.",""
"55049764-2-7924","Well, now that we're a big happy family, you should have <<1>> go over the plan so you know what to expect. It's going to be brutal. I can't wait.",""

"55049764-2-7929","I take <<1>> at her word, and I'm sure there's a good reason for the delay. But it looks bad when she can't construct a simple building for the people she's sworn to lead.nnI do hope <<2>> can clear things up.",""
"55049764-2-7930","<<1>>'s betrayal could not have been more absolute. She knew the details of the ratification ceremony, which puts <<2>> at risk.nnIt's my sister's own fault. She thought to appease <<c:3>> and the Mane by agreeing to this foolish process.",""
"55049764-2-7934","Don't think to start any trouble. None of us are in a forgiving mood.",""
"55049764-2-7935","Firaelion's a little shaken, but he'll be okay. I won't let him out of my sight again for a long time, you can be sure of that.",""
"55049764-2-7937","Your victory will be remembered. We could feel the death of Brinarch through the earth beneath our feet. Even the insects will not mourn him.",""
"55049764-2-7938","You did it. And Wyress Nyronie's sacrifice pays off. Now we only need to contact our other sisters and drive out the remaining Reachmen.",""

"55049764-2-7940","I look forward to your final show of prowess.",""

"55049764-2-7942","I've let the High King know how much of a help you've been. Killing Maugruhl, by the way. That was especially impressive.",""
"55049764-2-7945","I brought <<1>> into custody. Of course, we can't question her without special permission from the Thalmor Inner Council.nnPolitics.",""

"55049764-2-7948","I should warn you. Ravenwatch Castle is as strange as the man who owns it. His family is very old, and they have … strange traditions.nnDon't worry, though. I have no doubt about the fact that he is on our side. You may rely on anything he says.",""

"55049764-2-7960","Today is a fortuitous day indeed for Rivenspire, though I fear other kingdoms within the Covenant may not be so lucky.nnI know that my husband considers you to be his champion, but I wonder if you might be willing to assist his queen as well.",""
"55049764-2-7961","Tread carefully, Vestige. Mannimarco's agents are everywhere. The King of Worms will not be pleased that you stole his prize captive from the Halls of Torment.",""

"55049764-2-7967","You've already done the Dominion a great service, but I need you to do a little bit more. It is finally time for the unification ritual, where an ancient ritual will prove I am fit to lead our people against our enemies.",""
"55049764-2-7968","I have a bad feeling this isn't going to turn out wellfor me.",""
"55049764-2-7969","I've half a mind to go after Nedras. What in Tamriel possessed him to leave me like this?",""

"55049764-2-7971","Damn him. Damn that stupid old mule. To think I'll never see him again, to give him a swift kick in the rear.",""
"55049764-2-7972","This one is so proud of Yenadar. To give himself so that others might live. Thank you for being honest with me, traveler. I know he would have wanted me to know the truth.",""
"55049764-2-7975","Ah, it is good to see you, my generous friend. I came here to pray to Mara for forgiveness for my past, and it was like the clouds parted and the sun shined on my soul.nnI have decided to stay and devote my life to Mara. It is a better life.",""
"55049764-2-7977","We'll finish patching up these farmers and then send them south, toward Fell's Run, at the first opportunity.nnMeanwhile, go find Darien. And if he's lollygagging with some lonely farm girl instead of working, punch him in the head for me.",""
"55049764-2-7981","I think I heard a troll up near the <<1>>, so I picked up my gear and returned to the city. I don't know about you, but I wasn't eager to tangle with a troll!",""
"55049764-2-7982","During their raid the Imperial Legionaries left our pavilion alone. I guess they're not all idiots.",""
"55049764-2-7983","This region has an incredibly rich history. I'm sure there are vast repositories of lore hidden in these hills and valleys … if you know where to look, of course.",""

"55049764-2-7987","Do you feel the power? Can you taste it?",""
"55049764-2-7990","Thanks for your assistance with the Imperials. Now we have to deal with bandits of a different kind. These Baandari plan to gouge us, I have no doubt.",""
"55049764-2-7991","Bested by twig-boned Imperials on our own ground …. nnShameful.",""
"55049764-2-7992","Well, that was demoralizing, wasn't it? nn""Your death matters little, Emeric."" I can't believe she said that! I don't know though. Is it true?",""

"55049764-2-8012","The real mystery is what's a woman like that wanting to do in a place like this? nnShe has a prisoner, but the Chamber of Passage is not a place for holding someone, it's a place for sending someone on!",""
"55049764-2-8013","I would take back what I did if I could. I just … I didn't know things would turn out this way.nnI thought that, for Dutheil, it would simply be a matter of finding new work. I didn't intend to destroy his life. His mind.",""

"55049764-2-8015","You have all the tools you need to save <<1>> with you. That greedy and cowardly man has few defenses.",""

"55049764-2-8023","Lovely day for a drink, wouldn't you say?",""
"55049764-2-8024","We follow the Green Pact in this home. Respect this, and we'll do the same for you.",""

"55049764-2-8026","The new treethane is a joke!",""
"55049764-2-8027","You should go. I'm not playing this lute for you.",""
"55049764-2-8028","I know you, brother. You're one of us, even if you don't know it yet. Hircine calls you. His song is in your blood.",""
"55049764-2-8031","What happened to you? It looked like you were in a daze for a few moments.",""
"55049764-2-8034","Leave me. There's nothing you can do.",""
"55049764-2-8035","I may have little time left before the Imperials find me. Let me pray in peace.",""

"55049764-2-8040","Thank you. Take this vial and fill it with the waters from this basin. The water must be taken by the one who carries it. With that done, make for the falls that feed into Gil-Var-Delle and pour the water at each crest. Nature will do the rest.",""
"55049764-2-8042","Oh, I know you! You must be the one her beautiful ladyship has been expecting!",""
"55049764-2-8044","Would you look at that line? We're drawing more people than in <<1>>!",""

"55049764-2-8055","Do you have them? You have them, don't you?nnOh, I shouldn't get my hopes up. They fell in the sea, didn't they? I knew it, I have the worst luck.",""
"55049764-2-8057","Look at them, limbs so sluggish and carapaces dreadfully dull. When you've raised the shalks since they were pupae, it gnaws at your heart to see them so listless.",""
"55049764-2-8058","You didn't drop a single one, I'm impressed! Come to think of it, I have been needing an apprentice ….",""
"55049764-2-8059","Oh, Edouard, you foolish man. Now look what you've done.",""
"55049764-2-8060","Have you found anything I could use? I've told our guests I'm still preparing, but they're eager to hear my stories.",""
"55049764-2-8062","This High Elf thinks that his people rule over me. The Wood Elves follow King Camoran, not some High Elf Queen! Am I right?",""
"55049764-2-8063","This Wood Elf doesn't realize he would be dead without Queen Ayrenn and the Altmer.nnSuch disrespect. We risk life and limb to save them and they thank us with  accusations and insults!",""
"55049764-2-8067","Now, where did I leave that scroll?nnYou'll have to excuse me. Just doing a bit of housekeeping.",""
"55049764-2-8068","I overheard what <<1>> intends to do in order to pad out his research journal, and if I wasn't still sickened from this poisonous spider bite I surely would be now.",""

"55049764-2-8071","All the Children of Yokuda are dead or gone. We did it!",""
"55049764-2-8072","I'm glad that you've learned to come to me when you are seeking knowledge!nnIn this case however, you will have to look elsewhere first. Say … away from me.",""
"55049764-2-8078","They're so cute together.",""
"55049764-2-8081","Oha visitor. Greetings. We don't get many walk-ins these days. ""Curfew and regulations"" from what I hear. nnCouldn't have been easy getting past all those Imperials. Maybe you should think about membership in the Fighters Guild.",""
"55049764-2-8082","Wouldn't trust Ludippe with my coin purse, but his eyes are good enough. Let's have a look inside, shall we?",""
"55049764-2-8084","Is that? Yes! I can tell by the runes. The slight alterations in the design and structure is unique to the Valenwood Ayleids. I would be greatly interested in reassembling and studying this tablet if you are willing to part with it.",""
"55049764-2-8087","If that gold is getting too heavy, I'd be happy to carry some of it for you.",""
"55049764-2-8088","Is he breathing? Tell me he lives.",""
"55049764-2-8089","Dammit! That's Kaleen. See to her. I'll keep watch.",""
"55049764-2-8090","Welcome to the guildhall, friend. Found any interesting books or scrolls? Please just place them on the desk. nnWe had a grimoire come in yesterday with troll fat all over it … so… safety first.",""
"55049764-2-8091","Ah, that's better!",""
"55049764-2-8095","Tell this High Elf she's being ridiculous. Yes, moon sugar is used to make skooma, but Khajiit use it as a spice! It's a facet of Khajiiti cultural cuisine!nnMoon-sugar shouldn't be regulated because some people use it for the wrong reasons!",""
"55049764-2-8096","Set this Khajiit straight! Moon sugar has important cultural significance to the Khajiiti, but some peopleespecially the Khajiituse moon sugar to make the drug skooma.nnMaking moon sugar illegal hinders skooma vendorsand that's a good thing.",""
"55049764-2-8100","Thank you. Take this ice rune. Captain Gemelle gave it to me to freeze the webs trapping the others. It should make them brittle enough for our soldiers to break free.",""

"55049764-2-8132","Take this ice rune. It should make the webs brittle enough for my soldiers to break free. Good luck.",""
"55049764-2-8136","Hm. For some reason, looking at you makes me want to vomit. My emotions just feel like they're going to burst out and run away again.nnOverall though, I am feeling a little lighter on my feet.",""

"55049764-2-8309","Never much time to chat, it seems. <<1>> wants to know how well we've fulfilled our contract, and you're the only neutral person around.nnI hope you can give a good report of our work.",""
"55049764-2-8310","They speak in circles, like city-people do. What do they mean? And why do they smell so much like the harpies?",""
"55049764-2-8311","You can't leave us out to dry. We're good, mostly honest fellows. Trying to make a living. You're not so different than us when it comes down to it.",""
"55049764-2-8316","You know how hard we worked for them, right? Toughest job we've ever had.",""
"55049764-2-8317","I don't see Althen. If you have questions, that's fine, but at this point, I'm counting on you.nnYou don't want to disappoint the Ring of Daggers, do you?",""
"55049764-2-8318","Damn bastard Gavendien! Did it all for the jewels, and got away with it, too!nnHe got me good. I'll survive, but he cut Lauravieve's throat. He didn't have to! He just did it to prove a point. I thought I could be cruel, but he is a monster!",""
"55049764-2-8319","We did everything they told us to, but somehow we still failed. How will I ever make this right?",""
"55049764-2-8320","They were using my mill, the bastards! And look what they did to the poor jeweler!",""
"55049764-2-8321","I'm sorry, but the jewelry shop is closed for today.",""
"55049764-2-8322","No, no. I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to stay right here. Yes. Right here.",""
"55049764-2-8323","Praise the Eight! Did you kick that stupid thug's teeth in? I don't know what was worsebeing held hostage or smelling that ruffian's breath!nnWhat about the robbery, though? Did you stop them or did they get away with the jewels?",""
"55049764-2-8324","I can't wait to see my father again. I hope he's all right.",""
"55049764-2-8325","Why? Why would they kill her? She was cooperating! She gave them the jewels!",""
"55049764-2-8328","I'm yours to do with as you will. Whatever you decide, I will go along. My fate is in your hands.",""
"55049764-2-8330","Don't feel bad. I knew Julien was a hopeless case. A man who's sick in love is a sad man indeed. nnI feel sorry for him, really. Enlisting would have probably helped set him straight.",""
"55049764-2-8333","Remarkable. It appears to be an intact volume of Ayleid lore. If it's real, then this is what we came here to ….nnNo. This can't be correct.",""
"55049764-2-8336","Nice of you to finally join us. Those damn Montclairs have locked me out of my own city!nnIf any of my people have been hurt, I'll kill Montclair and his daughter with my bare hands.",""
"55049764-2-8341","Qariar is the Blademaster of House Dorell. He's a good man. See what he has to say about all this.",""
"55049764-2-8342","You can reach the Pass by traveling west along the northern coast. And when we get there, I intend to make Montclair pay for the damage and sorrow he has brought to Rivenspire.",""
"55049764-2-8343","It seems that some of my loyal subjects have become dissatisfied with my leadership. Think that I have been blinded by the Light that shines so brightly around me.nnWell, to Oblivion with them! To Oblivion with him! I don't have time for this now.",""
"55049764-2-8345","If we don't get Gwendis out of there soon, those restraints will break and she'll feed on the nobles.",""
"55049764-2-8346","Without <<1>>, we will be hard pressed for help, but we'll get on, somehow.nnThank you again, my friend. For everything.",""
"55049764-2-8347","How wonderful it is, to have everyone safe at home! We owe you everything, my friend. I do hope you'll visit. We could go to the windmill and you can tell me all your stories!",""
"55049764-2-8348","Thanks again, friend. We never would have made it out of there without you.",""
"55049764-2-8349","Destroy the <<1>>. It's … it's the only way to make sure this never happens again.",""
"55049764-2-8350","I'll be more understanding with <<1>>. I promise. With Federic leaving … mind you, I still don't approve. But she is a good lass. She doesn't deserve what I did to her.",""
"55049764-2-8351","I knew it! You lost your spine, didn't you?nnThat's fine. I'll be here a bit longer if you get it back. Otherwise, goodbye to you and your stupid Shornhelm Guard.",""
"55049764-2-8354","You're right, again. They do.",""
"55049764-2-8357","I must tell you the rules before you ready yourself for the race.",""
"55049764-2-8359","There is no way I'm sticking around here to shovel horse dung for the rest of my life.nnI got big dreams, and I got the skills to make them happen.",""
"55049764-2-8362","I'm glad that my daughter's happy, but I'm not sure I can ever trust Dulkhi. Not after what happened.",""
"55049764-2-8366","Hmm. You know, that's the first time I've seen Countess Tamrith in her full armor. She looks so very … yummy.nnI mean regal! That's what I meant!",""
"55049764-2-8367","He's really gone, isn't he? The mighty Verandis.nnI hate this! I really hate it!",""
"55049764-2-8368","Well done! I'll follow in a moment. I find this room strangely calming and I want to look around.",""
"55049764-2-8369","What is your decision? We need your help.",""
"55049764-2-8372","Did I see the flutter of butterfly wings? It must have been a trick of the light.",""
"55049764-2-8373","Oh look. You're that nosy, fobbing arse who talked me into joining the Shornhelm Guard, aren't you?nnTalk about a nightmare. All that marching … I actually prefer to be here in the stocks, and it's clearly where I belong.",""
"55049764-2-8374","Hey there. You the one Queen Maraya bought passage for to Sentinel? All right.nnI'm just glad you didn't bring along a chest full of luggage. We got to row out to the Posset in this little dinghy here. Real glamorous, eh?",""
"55049764-2-8375","My friend from Hoarfrost! These two wouldn't be here if not for you. You should be proud.nJulien and Shuga have turned out to be great soldiers.nnMartin couldn't cut it, though. Abandoned his post one night. I hear he's back in the stocks again.",""
"55049764-2-8377","I'm really enjoying the soldier's life. The thrill of battle, the rush of victorythese are real feelings.nnI'm thinking about staying in the Guard. Mad as it may be, now that I know Guendeline's waiting for me, I don't really like her any more.",""
"55049764-2-8379","Strange times, my friend, strange times indeed. And you know what strange times call for? A drink!",""
"55049764-2-8383","I'm not the seer my grandmother was. She didn't need to hear any gossip. Oh, no! She knew long before anyone else what trouble I'd be in. How I miss her!nnTell me what happened; the bones are unclear.",""
"55049764-2-8384","Doom has come to Craglorn! The stars have vanished from the sky! nnWill no one listen? Will no one help?",""
"55049764-2-8385","Stay safe out there. Lots of things that want to kill you.",""
"55049764-2-8386","Thanks again for everything you've done. I'll take some time with the amulet to see if it could be of further use to us.nnIf you're looking for other ways to aid us, Hara might have some suggestions on where to go.",""
"55049764-2-8388","Glory has no patience for the idle. Go prove your worth against the Reachmen in Shor's Stone.",""
"55049764-2-8390","I'm just going to sit right here until all this nonsense between the nobles blows over.",""
"55049764-2-8391","Montclair is responsible for all this madness? Hard to believe. He was always kind to me.",""
"55049764-2-8392","The city is safe now, and do you know why? Because Baron Dorell took charge and showed Montclair's lackeys the business side of his boot!",""
"55049764-2-8393","The Light shines on Shornhelm and the Countess! Thanks to them, the city is safe again and Montclair is on the run.",""
"55049764-2-8394","They say the city is safe now, but how can they be sure? Baron Montclair's followers could be all around us, waiting for another opportunity to rise up and strike!",""
"55049764-2-8395","They say it wasn't really the Baron who attacked us. It was some kind of mad Argonian. I never did trust those overgrown lizards!",""
"55049764-2-8396","Welcome back to the Hall! How goes the search?",""
"55049764-2-8397","I suppose I'm lucky I made it out alive, but by the Three I'm glad you came along.nnIf I'd failed here, I think my captain would've had my head.",""
"55049764-2-8398","Good, good. I think I'll have a sit down out here. The wind seems very gooey, doesn't it? Very squishy. Ugh.",""
"55049764-2-8399","Don't worry about me. I'll be waiting here with these rented guar, my carts, and the stench of decomposing guards. No rush.",""
"55049764-2-8401","Soldier, report. What brings you to Ash Mountain? Did Holgunn send you?",""
"55049764-2-8403","Damn those Covenant bastards! It seems like they're fighting us at every turn.",""
"55049764-2-8404","When I was a kid back home in Riften, we'd kill any mudcrab we saw. Ensured they didn't get out of control.nnThat's how I feel about these Covenant soldiers. If we don't kill them all, they'll just keep coming.",""
"55049764-2-8405","I left the mines to breathe fresh air and swing my blade for the Pact. Then I get posted to this place. I think I'd rather go back to the mines. Hah!",""
"55049764-2-8406","Three guide your blade, soldier. Get out there and make us proud!",""
"55049764-2-8407","Thanks. Not many willing to help these days, especially a dusty Ashlander like me.nnWe'd planned to rest up at the Davenas' farm near Kragenmoor before passing through the Deshaan gate. He should know it.",""
"55049764-2-8409","I am so doomed.nnAnd it feels like there are a dozen horses dancing the Wood Elf frolic directly behind my left eye.",""
"55049764-2-8410","Is there something I can do for you? I really am rather busy at the moment.",""
"55049764-2-8412","Thank you for your help, I feel better knowing you're out there helping look for my Puddles.",""
"55049764-2-8417","That was considerably faster than I expected, thanks to your assistance.",""
"55049764-2-8418","Thank you for helping Priest Marnest. I feel better with you accompanying him. You never know if there are any more of those damn vampires hiding nearby.",""
"55049764-2-8421","Don't ask me why we're here. I have no idea. Someone seemed to think we needed to be here to keep Stormhaven safe.nnI haven't seen the rest of the kingdom, but this part's as dull as dirt.",""
"55049764-2-8422","Get out there and find the last of them. Northpoint won't rest easy as long as a single one of Lleraya's vampires remains within its walls.",""
"55049764-2-8424","I don't know how much more of this I can bear. nnWaiting for the general to call us back to the fight against the Ironhand Ogresit's gnawing right through my nerves.",""
"55049764-2-8428","Bad time to visit the city, traveler. Might want to move along.",""
"55049764-2-8429","Hurry, hurry! I'll meet you outside!",""
"55049764-2-8432","Well, hello there! I certainly hope you've found something worthwhile to read in your travels. The selection here has been rather slim. I've resorted to reading cook books! nnOn the plus side, the dinners I've made taste much better.",""
"55049764-2-8446","My Lord Vivec, I bear the most grievous news. Belronen Telvanni challenged me to a duel of blood. I regret to say I won.nnIt was a small cut upon the arm, enough to settle the matter. But he fell dead!",""
"55049764-2-8450","You must go to Bramblebreach. There is nothing more to say.",""
"55049764-2-8452","You have my thanks, traveler. And the thanks of every guard in Skywatch.",""
"55049764-2-8454","Hey there. Saw the carts, eh? Sorry, nobody out here but the help. The Queen herself is still in Vulkhel Guard.",""
"55049764-2-8455","My brotherthe plague boils his blood and ravages his body. I fear he doesn't have much time, but he wants to talk to you.",""
"55049764-2-8456","It's terrible. My book's gone. Years of my life wasted!",""
"55049764-2-8457","Oh, look at me! I'm a terrible mess! You really must excuse my dreadful appearance. I haven't been feeling very well lately.nnBy the way, you haven't seen Nostrum Breva, have you? She promised to bring me more of the Maulborn curative.",""
"55049764-2-8460","Do you hear that? It tastes like yellow ….",""
"55049764-2-8461","We're a family again thanks to you!",""
"55049764-2-8462","It is good to see a friendly face. Greenshade is a far more exciting place than Raz expected.nnHe hears now that the Staff of Magnus has been stolen? As if these rebellious Bosmer rebels weren't trouble enough!",""
"55049764-2-8463","Don't come near me! Are you real?",""
"55049764-2-8464","You're not a daedra. What's going on?",""
"55049764-2-8465","You are a miracle worker. Without your help many people would still be in the clutches of the daedra.",""
"55049764-2-8470","You've done the fallen warriors proud. We completed our mission. That's got to stand for something.",""
"55049764-2-8471","Please. Stop the Maulborn and destroy their ability to make more of this damn plague.nnJust be careful. The chamber ahead is crawling with an army of plague husks.",""
"55049764-2-8478","You are a miracle worker. Without your help many people would be dead or dying.",""
"55049764-2-8484","How very strange? What in the name of Oblivion were the Maulborn thinking when they mixed these toxic ingredients together?nnOh, are you back again?",""
"55049764-2-8485","The Eight guide your hand, traveler. You may be the only one who can restore this holy site.",""
"55049764-2-8486","Though I have no sense of sentiment, I am able to understand that her intentions are natural and even have merit.nnNonetheless, there are larger matters at stake here. This is the way it must be.",""
"55049764-2-8487","Stendarr guide your hand. You may be the only one who can restore this holy site.",""
"55049764-2-8491","Welcome to the Guildhall, knowledge-seeker. What brings you here today?",""
"55049764-2-8493","Please, hurry! I know you can do this. I have faith in you!",""
"55049764-2-8494","I can't leave the tree! Erunor and I must stay here as its last defense! Go, help the villagers below!",""
"55049764-2-8496","You did it? Well done! I never doubted you for an instant.nnNow, let me have the mixture, if you please.",""
"55049764-2-8497","If I were a few years younger and my hands were still steady, I'd do this for you. But I'm not and they aren't, so you're just going to have to go over to the alchemy table and get this done.",""
"55049764-2-8498","I hope Nilyne can put those healing herbs to good use.",""
"55049764-2-8499","I love listening to the sounds out here. It's rather peaceful, don't you think?",""
"55049764-2-8508","Three keep you, traveler. Welcome to the Davon's Watch Guildhall. What brings you to our doorstep?",""
"55049764-2-8509","Hello. I understand you've been helping Hara study the Celestials. We're truly grateful for your aid.",""
"55049764-2-8512","Do you know how much gold I've spent to get my wife here? And now the Maulborn have stopped providing their curative?nnI'd trade my entire estate if it meant the plague would release its hold on my wife.",""
"55049764-2-8513","Hello again, my slick-scaled friend. Have you been to the Armature yet? And did I ever tell you about Emberflint?",""
"55049764-2-8514","Mimic the water and flow and we will have no cause to inflict angry pain upon each other.nnThe Maulborn discarded these crates, so now they belong to us.",""
"55049764-2-8515","Those damn Maulborn stink flies! They refuse to give us the curative, just because they call us lizards and look down upon us.nnSo we'll take the curative. As soon as we can find any.",""
"55049764-2-8516","We were hoping to find something good in these crates, but the Maulborn don't seem to throw away anything valuable.nnTake whatever you want. Especially cheese. I hate cheese.",""
"55049764-2-8525","You're so lucky! Verandis never let's me go on dream-walks with him.",""
"55049764-2-8528","Traveler. How goes your survey of Zabamat? Have you found Hightide Hollow, as yet?",""
"55049764-2-8533","Don't mind my good-for-nothing egg-siblings. They're young, bored, and stupid.nnRest assured, I shall continue to remain open throughout this time of crisis.",""
"55049764-2-8537","Why'd we ever come to this island? It's so out of the way. At least <<1>> promised us extra pay for this.",""
"55049764-2-8538","Life is so precious, and so fleeting. Don't let it pass you by. Take time to feel the caress of the wind and listen to the way it carries the sound of your true love's name.nnMirilir … I never did hear anything so sweet and so dear.",""
"55049764-2-8543","I'm rather fond of Estre. High Kinlady Estre, that is. So noble, just, and Altmer through and through. She'll keep us strong.",""
"55049764-2-8547","Who knew that so many afflicted would flock to the Serk! All these people. They're so … sick.",""
"55049764-2-8550","Welcome to Shrouded Hollow! Will you be sojourning with us? Or are you simply a visitor?",""
"55049764-2-8556","These are dark times, and the Star-Gazers are a shadow of who we once were. But our role remains more important than ever.",""
"55049764-2-8557","Always work to do! Keeps one very busy, yes?",""
"55049764-2-8559","The Sword-Disciples are still in thrall to the Serpent. Anything you can do to put them to rest would ease my mind.",""
"55049764-2-8560","I've heard there are atronachs tearing the land apart to the east. Rare ones, even. Unseen for centuries. I wish I could see for myself!",""
"55049764-2-8567","If you would receive knowledge, you must give knowledge in return. nnWhat have you brought me, Seeker?",""
"55049764-2-8571","I will seek out these monks once I make sure everything here is all right.nnI will see you soon.",""
"55049764-2-8572","What happened to you out there? You look horrible. Think of the legendary scars you'll get from those wounds!nnYou'd better head back out, or I'll beat you to the center of that Citadel. Soon as Roaring Ramavel and the others get here.",""
"55049764-2-8580","Hermaeus Mora's shrine is in the deepest part of the archive. I have an unusual relic from the Dragontail mountains to trade for the knowledge of the Celestials. I hope it's enough.",""
"55049764-2-8586","Greetings! I am Vanus Galerion, head of the Mages Guild. I have need of your assistance.",""
"55049764-2-8588","Good luck with that Darius fellow at the Mages Guild. And, of course, let me know if I can get you something.",""
"55049764-2-8589","In time, the body you and Valaste have formed for me will fade. But with this charm, you'll never forget our trials together. The decision you made. I take comfort in that.nnAre you ready?",""
"55049764-2-8595","The court has heard tale of your deeds at the Sentinel Docks, Wayfarer. Perhaps you have some advice to offer our great king in this time of need.",""
"55049764-2-8601","Here is a person who looks noble and respectable. Yes. Razum-dar thinks you would be perfect to act as Queen Ayrenn's envoy.nnIt is a very dignified task. You should be honored that this one even asks.",""
"55049764-2-8617","Get down and be quiet. We don't want to give our position away.nnWe're keeping an eye on these Red Rook bastards. They're not the simple bandits they pretend to be, that's for sure. If you want to help, go talk to <<1>>.",""
"55049764-2-8620","When I was young, I studied all the tumultuous times and the heroic deeds from the first era and I always wished I had lived back then instead.nnRecent events have made this era more interesting though. I realize nowthese times are good too.",""
"55049764-2-8623","I wish you the best in there. If one Nereid caused all of this, the power she wields will be frightening.",""
"55049764-2-8624","I can't believe it. So many dead. Our whole city in ruins. All because of those damned mages.nnPlease, you have to help us.",""
"55049764-2-8625","Arch-Mage Yamanu-ko is in this tower. We call it the Apex Tower. The arch-mages of Elinhir have occupied it for centuries.nnIt was our duty to protect the city. Instead, we leave a legacy of destruction.",""
"55049764-2-8626","Thanks for all of your help!",""
"55049764-2-8628","Hurry. We need to channel the elemental infusions so that we can force an opening into the staff.",""
"55049764-2-8629","That was sickening. I had to get rid of it. He just left … the body here. By the Light of Aetheriuswhat was he doing with it?nnLet's get out of here. We have a ritual site to find.",""
"55049764-2-8634","Go on! Hara waits upstairs.",""
"55049764-2-8638","It was this being all along guiding the lizards… this Hist. An exile. Shunned by others of its kind, forced to live here. I cannot blame them.nnYou bested the rest of her minions. Slay the one she calls Treeminder, and her fate is ours to decide.",""
"55049764-2-8648","I thank you, my friend. From the bottom of my soul, I thank you. I don't care where we go, or what we do. What you've given back to me is priceless.",""
"55049764-2-8650","Many believe the Nedes were barely more than barbarians, but ruins like this prove otherwise. Don't underestimate their cleverness. Look for a pattern if you can, and consider the possibility that the lock was designed to be impossible to open alone.",""
"55049764-2-8654","See you there.",""
"55049764-2-8656","Strike the Lost One down. It is the only way to end this.",""
"55049764-2-8657","The Lost One waits below. Do not delay.",""
"55049764-2-8658","That invitation is around here somewhere. Keep looking for it.",""
"55049764-2-8659","Go on. Search through Danni's things. Invade her privacy. I hope you have fun doing it, too.",""
"55049764-2-8660","I hope Danni doesn't find out about any of this.",""
"55049764-2-8661","What did you find in that trunk?",""
"55049764-2-8662","Enjoy your stay on Abah's.",""
"55049764-2-8665","They're out there! Those creatures in the water! I was at the water's edge and I saw them, looking up at me from beneath the surface. Hollow, pale eyes. nnWe have to get out of here!",""
"55049764-2-8666","Keep an eye on those tentacle worshippers by the staircase. This one would have gutted them already had Sali'ma not intervened.",""
"55049764-2-8667","We're going to take the Gray Barrows and use it for the new hideout for the Thieves Guild. I'll need your help.",""
"55049764-2-8670","The owner will be pleased you came to the Lass! I'll be sure to tell her! What can I get you?",""
"55049764-2-8674","There you are. Great! I've just gotten the boat ready.nnWe can get started whenever you're ready.",""
"55049764-2-8685","Hello there!",""
"55049764-2-8686","A bit of generosity for an unlucky soul?",""

"55049764-3-486","You bring warning from Fahjiri? I'll have words with that cat - she has more to do with this than she admits. Your warning comes late. Look in on Durak, then return to me.",""

"55049764-3-502","Just back from the docks, are you? nnThe Midnight Swell used to be a safe ship, back when Captain Lash was the captain. nnNo doubt its new captain threw the old one overboard. Fed him to the water Dreugh, I bet. nnYou'd best be wary near that lot.",""

"55049764-3-526","If you need something, talk to the Constable. Leave me in peace.",""
"55049764-3-528","You've proven very resourceful. As promised, I can help you restore Makana's memory to repay Durak for sharing his Sleepless Potion with me.",""
"55049764-3-529","We have dreamed a nightmare together, and come out alive. I am glad to see you awake, as well.",""
"55049764-3-530","If the wailing keeps up, we may find ourselves without any visitors at all. nnIf I had a choice, I'd leave as well!",""
"55049764-3-533","If you've come to poke fun at the prisoner, you'd better think twice. I'll be out of these stocks soon, and then you'll have to watch your back.nnThey may not have enough evidence to hold me, but that doesn't mean I'm not a dangerous criminal.",""
"55049764-3-536","Did you see her? Wearing the necklace I made? Well, I hope you're happy. This is all your fault.nnNow go away and let me work in peace.",""
"55049764-3-539","So you live, and Lord Montclair does not. Things could not have gone better, I'd say.nnI'm sure your noble house will be glad to hear of Montclair's death, though their strife is far from over.",""
"55049764-3-541","Go as fast as you can, Lieutenant. Until we've tried this, the king won't even talk about surrender.nnWe have to get him to come around before it's too late.",""
"55049764-3-542","Oh no! It's you. Have you come from Hosni? Please. Please have mercy.  nnS'rashi promises to have Hosni's gold soon, but S'rashi cannot get Hosni's gold if he's dead. Tell S'rashi you've not come to kill him.",""
"55049764-3-543","You. You're to go right in.",""

"55049764-3-546","You've returned, my friend, and you look well! Much better than the last hero I sent to retrieve a wyvern egg.",""
"55049764-3-551","You'll find the ward somewhere inside the Plane Merge, <<1>>.nnBe careful in there. We've already lost a scouting party, and I haven't a clue what got them. I'm sure it's waiting eagerly for more victims.",""
"55049764-3-554","Whoever did this to Mathias needs to pay. Hope you figure out who it was. I bet it was that creepy Altmer, Yarelion. nnI suppose it could have been any of the suitors though.",""
"55049764-3-556","The blue stone is called azurite. It's like her, when she speaks in my head. Her voice is soft. Do you hear it?nnTake my pickaxe. Find the blue stone. Bear caves. North. Near caves. You must.",""

"55049764-3-579","Go on into the tower and talk to the Hinaults. Reassure them. They're both pretty shaken up.nnBut if Heloise doesn't return soon, I may need to send you out to find her.",""

"55049764-3-592","Misfortune hangs over Rivenspire like a dark cloud, friend. And it doesn't help that the city leaders can't agree on which way is up.",""
"55049764-3-593","Travel to the east, into the Bonebarrow, and speak to Golleon. He will need your help.",""
"55049764-3-594","Well, I can hardly believe what I've heard. If this artifact of evil has been destroyed, when will its minions dissipate?nnI know I am too impatient. I do not know how you did this, but the fact that you did is enough of a reason to celebrate.",""
"55049764-3-596","How did those Saproot Shoots work out? I bet you made a right mess for those ugly Imperials.",""
"55049764-3-598","Take that charm I gave you to Priestess Fleile.nnShe's in Razorvine Refuge, north of here. nnTell her of your success. She will be pleased.",""

"55049764-3-603","If I could trade my life to bring back my dear Lakana, I would. Moving on will not be easy, but I must honor her sacrifice by doing all that I can to protect the Covenant.nnI will speak with King Fahara'jad. Perhaps we can come together in mourning.",""

"55049764-3-3265","Now that you have a king's writ you should study your profession under your new master. It will be hard, no doubt about it. Stick to it and you might mean the difference between success and defeat in Cyrodil!",""

"55049764-3-3479","The generals of the Alessian army played a vital part in the Battle of the Glenumbra Moors. Their weapons, if still intact, would suffice, I think.nnIf you manage to get your hands on the weapons, find Sarvith. He knows what to do from there.",""

"55049764-3-3849","There you are! Lorelia was starting to worry. She said those cultists were trying to mislead you again. She worried that you would turn against us.nnI knew it was all right though. Why would you possibly oppose Lorelia?",""

"55049764-3-3867","A spy in the camp? On my watch?nnUgh. Heads will roll over this. Literally, if Lady Alimah has any say in it. After my watch, I'm going to hit those ale kegs hard.",""

"55049764-3-3893","Can you help me, stranger? I fear for my soul. I've been bitten. I can already feel the hunger overwhelming me. nnI'm too much of a coward to take my own life, but I can't bear the thought of losing myself to this horrific disease.",""
"55049764-3-3895","Is it done? Is the envoy dead?nnThen let me out of here so I can go rescue my family!",""
"55049764-3-3896","I heard you doused the signal fires and stopped the Dominion attack. nnSounds like a fine day of work. A fine day of work, indeed!",""
"55049764-3-3899","We'll forever be in your debt.",""
"55049764-3-3905","The mayor and I will muster my bailiffs and tell everyone what happened. We'll prepare for a fight, but I don't think it will come to that.nnOnce you deal with Leonce, the militia should disband. We'll sort out the guilty after that.",""
"55049764-3-3911","Thank goodness you escorted my brother.",""
"55049764-3-3913","My fault. It was my fault, but I didn't mean it. Oh, Mother is sad now, very sad. nnI hate <<1>>. I hate him! But … I kind of want to join him. And that's bad. Very bad!",""

"55049764-3-3934","I hope you're not one of those gullible people. Susceptible to angry lies and wild accusations. Leonce has let the power go to his pointed, little head. It's disgraceful!",""
"55049764-3-3936","Not that I don't trust you, but there's something else going on here.nnWe must find out what it is and retake the garrison.",""
"55049764-3-3945","Thanks for bringing me word about my father and brother. They're good hunters, almost as good as their sister.nnI worry when they're gone overlong.",""
"55049764-3-3946","My sons! You brought them back to me! Thank you. nnUnfortunately, they're still unable to leave the horses' bodies. I called upon the Herd Mother for help, but … she wants to speak to you.",""

"55049764-3-3954","Thank you for your discretion. I'm rather concerned about what's going on in Hallin's Stand, but it's not a good idea to say so in public.nnYou see, it's my husband ….",""
"55049764-3-3955","Leave me to my shame. There is nothing you can do.",""
"55049764-3-3956","Though the necropolis is filled with heroes, you will only need four in your fight against <<1>>.nnLook for them in the crypts. Do what you can to persuade them to help you.",""

"55049764-3-3991","Troll's blood! Do you need an invitation? Speak to Tanval.",""
"55049764-3-3992","Go to the west gate and help <<1>>. Garyn can show the way.",""
"55049764-3-3996","Bring the <<1>>. I need it for what we must do.nnTrees will grow where we rest, and balance will be restored.",""
"55049764-3-4010","It's a good plan. Can't say I like ghosts anyway.",""
"55049764-3-4011","Fool that I was! I can only imagine what Giron is up to. You should find out.",""

"55049764-3-4035","Shalk are all over town. Collect their chitin and bring it to <<1>>.",""

"55049764-3-4539","Use the bellows to stoke the flame just a bit. Use the valve to fire it yet more. And for a truly fearsome blaze, pour fire salts on the coals.",""
"55049764-3-4541","It will be a while before Feyne accepts my choice.",""
"55049764-3-4545","Tree-Minders know many cures, for those who seek treatment.",""
"55049764-3-4548","Aelif will see you soon. She has business to attend to. Suspicions to investigate. We shall see.",""
"55049764-3-4552","I'm sorry, but I don't have time for outsiders.nnUnless you care to join the Fighters Guild. I'm sure the steward is around here somewhere.",""
"55049764-3-4554","We bargained in good faith! All fair and square! You can't have him.",""
"55049764-3-4559","Thank you again for your time on the river. One day, I hope to soothe my scales in the mud of laughter.",""
"55049764-3-4561","Pay the toll or pay the price. Something, something … rhymes with rice. Yes. Almost got it.nnI'm not good at warning rhymes yet. Don't look at me like that!",""
"55049764-3-4563","Adept, new recruits to the Guild rarely impress me anymore … but you've already proven yourself to me. Good luck in Sheogorath's realm.",""
"55049764-3-4564","I can sense … yes. The aura around you glows with good fortune. You will be the one to help me complete my final task.",""
"55049764-3-4565","I'm so glad we've had this time together. One must usually go to a public execution for conversation of this caliber.",""
"55049764-3-4567","You! Knave tells me you choose toll of flesh. True? True?",""
"55049764-3-4569","An outsider! You walk and talk, so no good for eating. Still, an intruder. You must pay the toll.",""
"55049764-3-4572","This has gone wonderfully. ""A simple overseer job,"" she said. ""Just like the old days."" Why did I ever leave Kragenmoor? nnMany thanks to you for your help.",""
"55049764-3-4573","Quickly! How did it go? Was there a strong color change? Perhaps a strong smell?",""
"55049764-3-4574","I … I don't feel so good.",""
"55049764-3-4575","I had no idea I was in Vaermina's thrall. She'll never touch my mind again, my friend.",""
"55049764-3-4578","The lute's probably back where Engling did her performance, down to the south. I'll be just on the next island over. Standing upright.",""

"55049764-3-4583","My crystal tells me you have done my terrible deed.",""
"55049764-3-4584","I'll bet you couldn't find my bongos. In fact, I wager you mocked me by accepting my task.",""
"55049764-3-4585","There is still more to do.",""
"55049764-3-4586","I saw some Dreamers packing up and fleeing.nnHave you done the deed?",""
"55049764-3-4587","Have you killed the Twilight Boss?",""

"55049764-3-4595","I can't stay here!",""
"55049764-3-4599","Thank you for getting me out of that mine. My husband and I are indebted to you. Once things calm down here, I'll get you that mead I promised.nnAnd it'll be good stuff from Hodmar's private stock, assuming the Goblins haven't stolen it.",""
"55049764-3-4604","If you hurry, you may be able to take <<1>> by surprise. Any advantage we can get at this point is worth it.",""

"55049764-3-4615","And the cycle of pain continues. I hope you're proud of your part in this tragedy.",""
"55049764-3-4616","How can I assist the hero of <<1>>?",""
"55049764-3-4617","Do you have it? Did you find the keystone?",""
"55049764-3-4619","I can see Wood Elves out there, but why?nnWe have nothing here that could possibly interest them.",""
"55049764-3-4621","My brother and I came here together to join the Companions, and I'll be damned if we're not leaving here together, but he's caught in the mine. Please, look for <<1>>, you must save him.",""
"55049764-3-4625","Excuse me. The keeper expects us to maintain this area without distraction.",""
"55049764-3-4627","I can't believe you actually sided with that coward.nnGo die in a hole, Goblin-lover. The Pact doesn't need any more snowbacks like you.",""

"55049764-3-4632","They're everywhere! I don't know where they came from. I didn't see them until I grabbed a bucket to douse the flames, and then it attacked me. A Daedra!nnMy fortunes have never looked less pleasing.",""
"55049764-3-4633","We now pause for a brief intermission. Would you like some cheese?",""
"55049764-3-4634","Did you find them? Did you find the Eyes? Let's get this door open!",""
"55049764-3-4635","You've saved us all, but the giants are gathering on the hill. The Worm Cult must have angered them. I just hope there isn't a stampede.",""
"55049764-3-4636","Please, help our comrades make it back to the watch! The commander is out there doing the same. You can help!",""
"55049764-3-4637","They keep trophies every time they kill an invader. That drum in the treasure pile should get the chieftain's attention.",""
"55049764-3-4638","I can't believe Dad brought down that mammoth. He's like Ysgramor!",""

"55049764-3-4646","Well. Glad to see someone who can get things done. Good work.",""
"55049764-3-4650","I wish we'd never come here, but <<1>> insisted we'd find a way to fit in.",""

"55049764-3-4705","Thank Stendarr! Safely back in Tamriel. nnNow, we just have to face the council.",""
"55049764-3-4707","Greetings, Vestige. Sai is recovering well enough, though he hides a great pain in his heart. His confinement has shaken him more than he dares admit.",""
"55049764-3-4710","Alive and kicking, I see. As for me, I feel a decade younger. Can you see the healthy shimmer to my scales?nnYou no doubt have questions. Please, ask. It's the least I can do after your help.",""
"55049764-3-4713","Time's growing as short as my patience. We must take action before it's too late!",""
"55049764-3-4721","Close the portals around <<1>> before the Covenant can gain a foothold.",""

"55049764-3-4734","Look who's back!",""
"55049764-3-4735","You did it! The traitor is dead, and Molag Bal's hold on Tamriel is weakened. nnYou are wise, comrade. Wise, and strong.",""
"55049764-3-4736","Remember to keep an eye out, just in case.",""
"55049764-3-4737","Did you see them? They're plotting, scheming, prerparing … but they won't get it. They mustn't get it!",""

"55049764-3-4745","What happened? I saw you say something to her, but I didn't catch it.",""
"55049764-3-4752","Remember, it's the appleblossom honey. That's what I need to make the next batch of mead.",""
"55049764-3-4754","You must stop Skorvild from carrying out his mad plan. Eating giants is just so … unappetizing!nnYou'll probably find him up in the old manor house. He's been spending a lot of time there lately.",""
"55049764-3-4755","Kazok's ugly head on a pike! I can't think of a better way to tell people that Voljar's Meadery makes mead fit for the toughest Nords.",""
"55049764-3-4756","The giant's leader usually prowls the hill overlooking the village.",""
"55049764-3-4757","I'm staying right here. Skorvild won't find me here.",""
"55049764-3-4758","Please tell me you've accomplished your mission.",""
"55049764-3-4761","Please don't kill me. He sent you to get his precious meat after I failed to return, didn't he?nnI don't want anything else to do with Skorvild or his cult. Just leave me alone.",""
"55049764-3-4763","I'm sorry. I'm dry with distraction.nnIf you want to join the Fighters Guild speak to Nil, our hall steward.",""
"55049764-3-4765","These Worm cultists disappoint me. They are weaklings. Failures.",""
"55049764-3-4766","A moment, please. No one else will listen. nnI have an idea that could help turn the tide against the Covenant.",""
"55049764-3-4773","Go on. Take a drink. It won't kill you.",""
"55049764-3-4774","I don't know what you did, but my soldiers and I are alive! Thanks.",""
"55049764-3-4775","These Worm cultists disappoint me. They are weaklings. Failures.",""
"55049764-3-4777","Did you make it through? The passage leads directly to the signal fires.",""
"55049764-3-4778","I suggest you get back to your mission, Adept.",""
"55049764-3-4779","I suggest you get back to your mission, Adept.",""

"55049764-3-4784","Hmm?",""
"55049764-3-4789","We must report to Sees-All-Colors right away, comrade.",""
"55049764-3-4790","I must tend to the wounded.",""

"55049764-3-4803","You're back at last. Were you successful?",""
"55049764-3-4810","What happened to you? You were doing so well. Why'd you stop running?",""
"55049764-3-4814","And what, may I ask, are you doing here? You mortals … always thinking you can go wherever you please.",""
"55049764-3-4815","And what, may I ask, are you doing here? You mortals … always thinking you can go wherever you please.",""

"55049764-3-4826","Good security is in the details, my friend. Keep an eye out for anything unusual.",""
"55049764-3-4827","So what have you learned?",""
"55049764-3-4835","Why you look so proud, what did you find out?",""
"55049764-3-4837","So what'd you find out?",""
"55049764-3-4838","Welcome to Windhelm! You're just in time for the celebration. nnIf you don't mind me saying so, you look pretty capable and good in a fight. Just the sort of individual that Thane Mera is looking for.",""
"55049764-3-4839","Thank Kyne! You have it!",""
"55049764-3-4840","I feel a thousand years young. Your tale captivated every one of us.nnI do hope <<1>> will tell another one soon!",""
"55049764-3-4841","I can't believe my ears. <<AC:1>> is restored! Praise the Silvenar's champion!",""
"55049764-3-4842","Please, be careful in the forest. Villagers return with tales of werewolves and Houndsmen prowling near town.",""
"55049764-3-4846","Your work here is done, Arrow. But know that you will always have a place of honor in the Skald-King's court.",""
"55049764-3-4850","Thank you for saving Spinner Indinael's spirit from the Worm Cult. If she'd remained a lich, we'd all be doomed.",""
"55049764-3-4851","You must go quickly. My hold on this world grows weaker with every passing moment.",""
"55049764-3-4852","You've saved the Spinner! Now, she can join the other spirits in eternal slumber. Thank you!",""
"55049764-3-4854","Well done. As a final step, you must scatter dirt on the fire.",""
"55049764-3-4855","Master Eveline and I will be waiting at the base of the root system.",""
"55049764-3-4856","Well. You got his attention. I can feel his energies shifting. He's angry.",""
"55049764-3-4857","Fascinating. The roots do not consume you. That may prove useful.",""
"55049764-3-4859","You brought an Imperial here? What for? I ought to crush his skull right now!",""
"55049764-3-4860","What news? Have you found my daughter?",""
"55049764-3-4861","I really enjoy these impromptu celebrations!",""
"55049764-3-4863","I need to figure out what happened here. My friends deserve answers.",""
"55049764-3-4867","You saved the lives of the hunters. You ruined their clothes, but you saved their lives.nnMy father will be upset when his slaves fail to locate new prey. He'll become curious. Then we'll catch him off-guard.",""
"55049764-3-4872","You gave the orb to my sister? nnI hope you had a good reason.",""
"55049764-3-4880","I can't believe all this happened. Because of a thief and an enchanted lute.",""
"55049764-3-4884","Thanks for coming to get me.",""
"55049764-3-4886","You follow me to my home? I should bite your feet off, and see how well you run!nnThe Hound is my consort. He has shown me the way of the wilds, and we rule over the forest, together. I need nothing from you!",""
"55049764-3-4889","With your help, I just know we're going to succeed!",""
"55049764-3-4890","Goat stew! You have to use a spoon or a fork to eat it. What kind of meal is that?",""
"55049764-3-4893","I'd love to travel to Alik'r and try their exotic spices.",""
"55049764-3-4894","We're fortunate no one has perished, but I fear my Keepers have grown desperate and cowardly. Did you hear Voranil's remark? Use Daedric power? Sacrilegious.nnWe need to get Rilis back in his prison before my Keepers do something they'll regret.",""
"55049764-3-4895","Holed up in a cave. Good to hear she's still up and kicking!",""
"55049764-3-4897","Greetings in his name. I've never been to Orsinium but I hear it's … nice. We're always pleased to have new faces join us.",""
"55049764-3-4898","Ah, the smell of fresh blood. It's intoxicating. I only wish I had been the one to drain the life from their bodies.nnBut this is not about me. This is about sending a message. And Valeric has heard it, loud and clear.",""
"55049764-3-4900","I miss my friends. I don't know if we will ever feel safe in Cragwallow again.",""
"55049764-3-4902","Things are quiet here. For now.",""
"55049764-3-4904","If the spirit of the former Green Lady is appearing to you, you should find out what she wants.",""
"55049764-3-4907","I'm afraid this is only the beginning. I burn with eagerness to eradicate our enemies.",""
"55049764-3-4911","The Ternion Monks have helped you and the Skald-King. Maybe now people will understand that we are not the monsters they thought us to be.",""
"55049764-3-4913","I'm sure we'll run into each other again. Maybe even when we have a show to perform!",""
"55049764-3-4914","Don't get yourself killed, now!",""
"55049764-3-4915","Come no closer until you've stated your business.",""
"55049764-3-4916","That was no trick. That was Sai Sahan!",""
"55049764-3-4919","It's always good to see you, brave one.",""
"55049764-3-4920","I'm sure Irnskar has other errands for you to run.",""
"55049764-3-4921","Lucky shot from one of those Sea Vipers. Looks like I'll have to postpone those dancing lessons.nnDid you find the sky-key?",""
"55049764-3-4924","King Jorunn stirs in agony before he calms and grows still. These waves repeat, even as you enter his dreams.nnHis life continues to slip away. What did you discover?",""
"55049764-3-4926","Once you rescue the Silvenar, you'll need a warrior's help to get him out of Jathsogur. All the advice I can give you won't make up for a strong sword at your side.",""
"55049764-3-4927","One more wounded warrior won't make a difference. Good advice is what you need on the road out of Jathsogur. Sacrifice me and Sariel can help you after you save the Silvenar.",""
"55049764-3-4931","I'll be along shortly. I'm not feeling … well.",""
"55049764-3-4933","Free of this accursed tomb and those thrice-damned cultists! I owe you a debt. Perhaps someday I'll repay it.",""
"55049764-3-4936","There are few who can claim to have fought against the Worm Cult and survived, let alone prevailed. nnI wonder if you might be convinced to strike another blow against them. The Skald-King could use someone like you at Honrich Tower.",""
"55049764-3-4938","We've got trouble here. The Reachmen have taken over the Northwind Mine up ahead.",""
"55049764-3-4939","Did I hear that right? The hero of Eastmarch? Well met, and good to have you with us!",""
"55049764-3-4941","Were you sent to rescue us?",""
"55049764-3-4942","The Stormfists were panicked by the raging fires. We cut through their ranks as quickly as we could, but I'm afraid we were too late.nnTell me … my sister …?",""

"55049764-3-5899","Have we met? The two of you look familiar.nnNo, I'm fine, I can focus. I'll help the captain stick a cutlass in <<1>>'s throat. Both of them, if I have to.",""
"55049764-3-5900","Don't worry, dearie. Just hop back there and give them what they want. You'll get the hang of it.",""

"55049764-3-5913","Help me, please! They've stolen my Iriana.",""
"55049764-3-5916","I think I'll stay out here a while longer, since this is as close to him as I'll ever get.",""

"55049764-3-5920","Quickly, my new friend. Speak to Khali. We're in agreement. The signs are all there. You may yourself have an important role to play in the Two-Moons Dance.",""

"55049764-3-5957","If we don't get those civilians out, they'll be sitting ducks for the Drublog.nnI've heard this particular Wood Orc clan likes nothing better than to torment the helpless.",""

"55049764-3-5983","There are no lies on the battlefield. Shall we find your truth?",""
"55049764-3-5984","Look for the entrance to Bloody Bhosek's dungeon beneath the palace. And watch your step.",""
"55049764-3-5985","If I smack you around too much, feel free to cry. I love it when they cry.",""
"55049764-3-5986","Now, answer my question. What are you doing here?",""
"55049764-3-5987","Do you think I'm an idiot? I just watched you give that moron his pouch of moon-sugar candy!",""

"55049764-3-6068","Go … Hallowed. Get her out of here.",""
"55049764-3-6069","Looks like the plan was a success. And Gloo said you helped to evacuate some of the villagers?",""

"55049764-3-6071","Hey, there you are! I remembered what you weren't supposed to do. nnBut you still have both your hands, so obviously you didn't do it!",""
"55049764-3-6072","I knew Captain Kaleen would get another crew together! When she wants something, she gets it!",""
"55049764-3-6078","Again, sailors flock to the Spearhead. For this, Kasan is thankful.",""
"55049764-3-6083","You will always find a warm welcome aboard our ship, for as long as Captain Kaleen's in charge.",""
"55049764-3-6084","Hey, when's the next high tide?",""
"55049764-3-6093","We must stop the cultists before their efforts bear fruit, to the ruin of us all.",""
"55049764-3-6094","Ahh, good choice, partner. Your cunning has made us a lot of coin.",""

"55049764-3-6121","It would seem that the Captain's concern for me was well founded.nnYou saved me from this assassin's blade, as well as from my own foolishness this day.",""
"55049764-3-6123","You have my thanks just for seeking that Rakhad. Shuzura thought him a noble Khajiit. But instead he is a snake in the grass.",""
"55049764-3-6124","Well done, very well done. Now take the circlet … and get ready.",""
"55049764-3-6126","This one hopes you can help Milk Eyes with his rat problem. Ezzag wants to find more than his old bones next time he goes for cards.",""
"55049764-3-6127","And what might you want?",""
"55049764-3-6128","I know I was bound for Daggerfall when my ship was attacked. I need to find a way there.",""
"55049764-3-6130","Can't hardly keep my eyes open. I hope I don't bleed out before I can get back to <<1>>.nnDid you find the plant?",""
"55049764-3-6135","Would you hurry up and bring me the item??",""
"55049764-3-6138","If the Pact leaves us alone, they are welcome to Drakelowe Keep.",""
"55049764-3-6143","What's all this, then?",""
"55049764-3-6146","Seems we've you to thank for <<1>> and the lieutenant's return.nnJone and Jode shall dance with you, wherever you may roam!",""
"55049764-3-6150","If you choose to destroy the relic, then you've turned your back on me and the Covenant.",""
"55049764-3-6151","Thank you for your service. By the time you're done gathering those samples, I'll be back up in the camp. Look for me there.",""
"55049764-3-6152","Good day. This one is on royal business. If you will excuse …",""
"55049764-3-6153","You're back! I knew you'd make it.",""
"55049764-3-6154","This was part of a larger plan. I'm sure of it!",""
"55049764-3-6155","You're the one who discovered what the Bloodthorn are planning?nnI'm impressed. Now go help kill them.",""
"55049764-3-6156","I need to get <<1>> out of here. Thanks to you, were going to have to find another way to heal his sickness.",""
"55049764-3-6160","When I heard my brother had fallen ill, I was extremely concerned. We've had troubles in Alcaire, but nothing this bad.nnAll the same, I'm glad to hear he's all right, and I understand I have you to thank for it.nnThank you.",""
"55049764-3-6163","Judging by that sickening smell, you got some of Zich's food.",""
"55049764-3-6174","Stay away from me, you foul beast.",""
"55049764-3-6179","Do you always fall for such sob stories?nnWell, I think it's a fool's errand, but be careful out there.",""
"55049764-3-6183","You've done well, but I need you to talk to <<1>> about getting more of the people on our side.",""
"55049764-3-6186","This is a disaster. The bastards were prepared for us.",""
"55049764-3-6187","I was a fool, an arrogant, overconfident fool. I should have listened to them all.",""
"55049764-3-6191","We're preparing to climb to the summit. Destroy the other Conduit Stones and meet us there.",""
"55049764-3-6192","Those damn Redguards! Showed up and made me move from the warm spot I had by the river!nnI may be poor, but a little respect would be nice.",""

"55049764-3-6208","Tell me what you found.",""
"55049764-3-6209","Honor to you. Three keystones must be activated to unseal the entrance to the inner ruins of Moriseli. You'll find them ahead. nnBe cautious. The air reeks of foul necromancy. Powerful magic taints the very ground.",""
"55049764-3-6212","What's my brother talking about? How did he fail us? You need to talk some sense into him!",""
"55049764-3-6218","I wish this victory didn't feel so hollow. Other than keeping the undead at bay, it seems there's little we can do to battle this darkness.nnWe are here to support you and Indaenir though, if you need us. Are you going to rejoin him now?",""
"55049764-3-6220","I trust you will make wise decisions.",""
"55049764-3-6222","I think the Forge-Wife's bite is much worse than her bark. Seriously, her tusks are huge.",""
"55049764-3-6223","Hey friend. Care to have a drink? nnYou'll have to buy though. I'm flat broke. Can't even pay my debts. Have to go upstairs and tell S'rashi I don't have his money …. You think he'll have me killed?",""
"55049764-3-6225","Steel and stone, another mainlander?  At least you don't look like a good puff from the bellows would knock you over.",""
"55049764-3-6226","Your defeat will honor the Seamount clan.",""
"55049764-3-6227","Come to try your luck with me?",""
"55049764-3-6233","I see Talmo's Aldmeri banner. I hoped you would destroy it.",""
"55049764-3-6235","The Bright Moons will guard your path!",""
"55049764-3-6236","If you do the hunting, I'll do the cooking. I promise you won't regret helping me beat <<1>>!",""
"55049764-3-6240","There's something moving in there. Help me get it open.",""
"55049764-3-6241","I understand the Orcs want you to prove our worth through combat?  How depressingly typical of their kind.",""
"55049764-3-6243","What a fortunitious event, meeting you here! I hope your hunting went well.",""
"55049764-3-6246","When I recover completely, I'll leave this place and start over.",""
"55049764-3-6247","I don't know what I'll do without that lute. I've been a musician since childhood.",""
"55049764-3-6250","Troubled times in Glenumbra, it seems. All I hear is bad news no matter where I turn.nnBut the worst, as far as I'm concerned, is poor Crosswych.",""
"55049764-3-6251","You're not considering keeping that thing, are you? It'd take all the fun out of war.",""
"55049764-3-6252","An intriguing place, the Valley of Blades. It'll be a treat to see where Sai Sahan trained as a boy.",""
"55049764-3-6253","This is a great moment! You will assist me in the study of this object, won't you?",""
"55049764-3-6254","Do you have the poison gas? Quickly now, give it to me.",""
"55049764-3-6255","First you appear out of nowhere, and now this! What are you anyway?",""
"55049764-3-6257","We'll hold here. Keep moving.",""
"55049764-3-6258","Continue on your path. We have your back.",""
"55049764-3-6261","We should get started with the clean-up as soon as possible.",""
"55049764-3-6266","The destructive act unleashes their corporeal form, yes? Untethers them from Nirn. The attunement Esan has put on the Fang draws forth power from that tether, harnesses it for our needs.",""
"55049764-3-6269","I really need those mushrooms. Five should do for now.",""
"55049764-3-6270","I meet you at last. I saw you defeat the scheming Redguard who rules Stros M'Kai. I see great events swirling about you.",""

"55049764-3-6284","I didn't expect an outsider to be of any help. I am indebted to you.",""
"55049764-3-6285","You have done it. All that remains is to claim the Claw.",""
"55049764-3-6286","You are a bright moon in Felari's sky. Thank you. You can find Nethrin recovering in the tavern. He's beside himself with worry.",""
"55049764-3-6288","Welcome aboard. I have interesting news. <<1>> has asked us for a favor. He has another problem he'd like us to resolve.",""
"55049764-3-6292","We … we did it. We walked the path and lived. I'm … I'm going to be the Mane. And my sister is dead.",""
"55049764-3-6301","The Dominion has never known a greater hero. And I am proud to call you a friend.",""
"55049764-3-6317","Your bravery astonishes me, Hallowed. To my ears this Path you walk sounds like some kind of nightmare.",""
"55049764-3-6318","Our thoughts are with you, Hallowed. May the Green guide your steps.",""
"55049764-3-6319","The hopes of my people go with you, Hallowed.",""
"55049764-3-6328","The wardstones surround the grove. They are powered by magicka.",""
"55049764-3-6329","Traveler! A moment if you please. I'm an … associate of Cariel's. Would you have a moment to assist me? My horse startled as we crossed the bridge, and I lost some important cargo over the side.",""
"55049764-3-6332","Three servants reunited to their master. Only one remains.",""
"55049764-3-6335","Well … that hurt ….",""
"55049764-3-6336","Move on down the river, friend. I'm mulling my next wager. There is much profit to be made at the arena!",""
"55049764-3-6337","If what Razum-dar says is true, the city of Woodhearth owes you a debt. Of course, if the city's attacked and destroyed, that won't be worth much. Maybe we can prevent that.nnThe cat said you found orders from Vicereeve Pelidil. Can I see them?",""
"55049764-3-6339","If you're leaving soon, I'd like to ask a favor of you.",""
"55049764-3-6340","If you are fortunate enough to actually speak to the Wilderking, I suggest you keep the conversation to yourself.nnOtherwise, people might think your brain's turned to peat moss.",""
"55049764-3-6342","I'm glad you're here. We were worried we'd missed our opportunity. The other scouts report that Fildgor's flank is undefended.",""
"55049764-3-6352","May the light of the Bright Moons wash you in their purity. May you bathe in moonlight, and let it suffuse your soul.",""
"55049764-3-6353","Who's there? I didn't kill your Dominion friends. I warned them, but they didn't listen.",""
"55049764-3-6362","Beat three of my hunters in duels and my axe is yours.",""
"55049764-3-6363","I wonder if you know how completely we are in your debt? Alik'r warriors fear no evil, but they will not fight the undead.nnIt may be a superstition, but it has been tradition for centuries. I could not have convinced my guards to break it today.",""
"55049764-3-6364","By the Eight, you've got one of the skulls! And you don't appear to have fallen under the spell …. nnLet me see it. Please!",""
"55049764-3-6367","His hunters? Ha! The Hunt-Wife better not hear him talking like that!",""
"55049764-3-6372","Something's wrong. He smells … very dead.",""
"55049764-3-6374","Not another one. Where does Garnikh find you suckers?",""
"55049764-3-6375","Yeah? I don't have all day.",""
"55049764-3-6376","We should head up to the gates to the keep. It won't hurt to check in on the King, though I doubt anyone without a key could get past those gates.",""
"55049764-3-6378","My hope is that Prince Azah might have a lead on where Uwafa and Alasan have set up their headquarters, or better yet, what they're planning next.nnRegardless, these are things we should discuss at the palace.",""
"55049764-3-6382","Those supply caches are the runners' only chance to reach help. We must get them stocked!",""
"55049764-3-6392","I know that many aren't happy you kept the relic, but you made the right decision.nnIf you're ever in trouble, you can call on my blade. I hope we get the chance to sail together again, my friend.",""
"55049764-3-6394","Move along. Don't you have somewhere to be?",""
"55049764-3-6395","Sithis? Here? That can't be ….",""
"55049764-3-6397","Hallowed, I can see the light of the Dance reflected in your eyes. Jone and Jode smile down upon you now. They are with you, at this difficult hour. You must choose.",""
"55049764-3-6408","As you've just seen, the young girlAraniasis associated with the Veiled Heritance. Until I know more about her, I hesitate to call her an enemy.nnI will have more insight soon though. Even now, Aranias is on her way to my throne.",""
"55049764-3-6409","I heard what she said. She's a good friend, Bowenas. Must be very hard for her.",""
"55049764-3-6410","What I propose is simple. A kind of limited partnership. Kill <<1>> and walk out of here with that boy Tand.",""
"55049764-3-6412","My life mate must have been sick with worry. I never thought I would see Sind again. This one doesn't deserve him.",""
"55049764-3-6413","This one begs your indulgence. He wonders if you have seen a flaxon-furred Khajiit with a braided mane in your travels?",""
"55049764-3-6414","Well met, friend. I don't suppose you have seen a male Khajiit wandering about? He has mane-braids like mine, and a foolish tendancy to gamble until his pockets are empty.",""
"55049764-3-6415","I can see the benevolence of S'rendarr in your eyes. Thank you.",""
"55049764-3-6421","Let's see how tough your guardian is. Go to the stumps to pit your guardian against the others. You can use the stone to heals yours if you like.",""
"55049764-3-6422","So you commanded the general to turn around and fight on our behalf instead?nnI feel sorry for the spirits of his soldiers that they remain bound here, but at least you were able to free the villagers from the Shadow Wood.",""
"55049764-3-6423","You've returned! nnI hope you have fared better in your travels than I. For a moment I imagined you were a Daedric illusion. Rilis and his Daedric thrall have been a menace to me.",""

"55049764-3-6928","Green keep you. This is my first time on the borderlands of Valenwood. And my first time in a Khajiiti temple! I'm honored to be here today.",""
"55049764-3-6931","The path never ends, my friend. We must always walk forward and pray that the moons will guide us to where we should go. Now I must rebuild this city and my people. Restore the physical body of the Khajiit and the spiritual body of my people.",""
"55049764-3-6939","Some things are best left undisturbed.",""
"55049764-3-6949","Hey there mortal! How you doing?",""
"55049764-3-6952","The story now approaches its conclusion. There will be a reckoning for Aranias and for the Wilderking himself.nnYou must hasten to Greenheart, for you still have a key role to play.",""
"55049764-3-6953","If the Eldest has been corrupted, then everything in this areaevery plant, every creature, and every person will soon become corrupted as well.nnI can't imagine how this blight can so easily penetrate the forest's protections.",""
"55049764-3-6954","Nnnn! It's … just barely holding together!",""
"55049764-3-6955","Quickly. Aranias waivers. She knows now why she was guided herenot to destroy the Valenwood, but to save it.nnShe wants to change course, but she's afraid. She's afraid to stand up to Andur.",""
"55049764-3-6957","It's you …? From Silatar? My … my friend. Thank the Eight! You were right about the Veiled Heritance. I'm sure now. nnThey used me as bait to trick the Wilderking, and now Andur's going to kill him. I can't let that happen. I have to stop Andur.",""
"55049764-3-6958","It's you! And Lyris! What are you doing here?",""
"55049764-3-6967","I saw you talking to <<1>>. I hope he's finally going to do something about these ruffians and thieves.",""
"55049764-3-6968","You've returned! Don't try to interfere. Pircalmo brought this on himself. Atronachs! In our wood!",""
"55049764-3-6969","I don't know what <<1>> plans to do about these bandits, but I hope he does it soon.",""
"55049764-3-6971","What's going on? Where's Pircalmo? Where's my husband?",""
"55049764-3-6972","Another damned bandit? Oblivion take you, I have no more supplies to give you, filth.",""
"55049764-3-6977","You look weary. Perhaps you'd care to stop here and rest? We have much to offer.",""
"55049764-3-6978","My dueling lessons have finally paid off. We made it down here with almost no trouble. Well, <<1>> helped a little.nnDid you find Lady Laurent's jewels?",""
"55049764-3-6980","You look so tense! You need to relax. Please, enjoy our hospitality and let all your worries slip away.",""
"55049764-3-6981","Did it work? Yes, I can see it in your eyes! Now you can see things as they really are.",""
"55049764-3-6982","I'm half a heartbeat from throwing you out of this camp.",""
"55049764-3-6985","What?",""
"55049764-3-6993","After you receive your briefings from Hahnin and Gabrielle, select a soldier to accompany you on your mission. Choose carefully, for our plan hinges on you opening the way into the Labyrinth.nnThis is our last strike. Make it count.",""
"55049764-3-6994","I have seen more than my fair share of years. Many more. But in all that time, I've never contemplated something as foolhardy as this.nnWe're about to face a Daedric Prince for the fate of our world, and I couldn't be more proud of all of you.",""
"55049764-3-7005","What are you waiting for? Kill that horrible creature already!",""
"55049764-3-7009","Welcome, Moon Hallowed. Welcome to your first steps along the path.",""
"55049764-3-7012","I'm a brilliant artificer and a genius when it comes to Dwemer constructs. But I have to tell you, being surrounded by all these remarkable men and women .… It's kind of humbling.nnI hope I live long enough to record this in my posterity journal.",""
"55049764-3-7013","This one cannot wait to see what's inside the stronghold of the Daedric Prince!nnBut Zur wishes that Gadris was here to share this auspicious occasion.",""
"55049764-3-7015","I imagined that this was going to be a grand adventure, but I never pictured the horror of all this.nnSo many of our friends and companions have died, and this damn vortex still threatens our world. I think it's time we shut it down. Permanently.",""
"55049764-3-7026","I see you there, but you must wait. A scholar's work is seldom urgent, but I have a request from the king himself. It seems the Ansei Wards have been misplaced! nnWait, I should not have …. Um, just forget I said that.",""
"55049764-3-7027","Hurry! If you take too long, these Ungodly might decide to kill me. Find those keys!",""
"55049764-3-7028","I'm afraid you'll have to pardon me. I'm here on royal business.",""
"55049764-3-7029","Don't talk to me. I have problems. Big problems.nnYou wouldn't understand.",""
"55049764-3-7030","We did it. It was an honor to fight beside you once again. We've certainly come a long way from the Temple of the Mourning Springs, don't you think?",""
"55049764-3-7035","How much gold did you take from my daughter's dowry? How full are your pockets, you snake?",""
"55049764-3-7039","My soldiers stir from their feral state. I can only assume the corruption has receded, and Naemon is again put to rest.",""
"55049764-3-7042","At last! Sai Sahan has been taken to the Halls of Torment!",""
"55049764-3-7043","Come. I need to speak with Queen Ayrenn. I expect she'll want to speak with you as well.",""
"55049764-3-7044","Now here's one who I know is loyal to the king! It's good to see you again, my friend.nnYou're going to find this hard to believe, but the damned Imperials are here! They've seized control of the cityfor the moment, at least.",""
"55049764-3-7046","I'll be with you in a moment.",""
"55049764-3-7058","You're back! You stopped <<1>>, then?nnOh, no. <<2>> didn't survive, did she?",""
"55049764-3-7060","You keep returning like some kind of scale-rot. Leave me be, outsider.",""
"55049764-3-7061","Praise Meridia! This one was worried he'd never find another living soul in this horrible place.",""
"55049764-3-7066","She is wounded! Did you hurt her?",""
"55049764-3-7068","We have to find out what they're doing.",""
"55049764-3-7069","We've got some repairs to do on the Prowler, but maybe we'll sail together again soon. Until then, stay safe.",""
"55049764-3-7070","We should check the houses, or secluded areas with good visibility of the quay.",""
"55049764-3-7071","Survivors of the Sea Viper attack will likely have hidden. Perhaps the buildings around <<1>>?",""
"55049764-3-7075","I knew we could do it! We're practically on Molag Bal's doorstep now!nnMolag Grunda is no more. At least for now. Daedra don't really die, if my studies are correct. But at lease she's out of our way for now.",""
"55049764-3-7081","Tu'whacca has taken the Chief beyond the dunes. So passes Marimahwater into sand. May all the Divines bless his passage.",""
"55049764-3-7082","We mustn't dally. Naemon's Shade and his servants clearly have larger, darker designs. nnWe should spread out and search for signs of their corruption and do our best to stamp it out wherever we can.",""
"55049764-3-7098","I think … I think I just narrowly missed Tu'whacca's summons, sister. I credit my mother. She had a stomach like an iron kettle.",""
"55049764-3-7101","Still alive, are you? And all your limbs intact? Maybe you should spend more time adventuring and less time at the tavern. Ha!",""
"55049764-3-7108","The old Fighters Guild Hall. It's near the main gate. Go!",""
"55049764-3-7109","We were able to overcome the vampiric snare of the Orchard. I expect we'll handle the Reaver Citadel with equal aplomb.",""
"55049764-3-7110","We have come so far, but we have leagues to go before this business is concluded.nnWe must push forward! We must find a way through the walls of the fortified city that looms ahead of us.",""
"55049764-3-7112","As I was saying, there's a blight here. I'd highly advise staying away.",""
"55049764-3-7113","Thank you, traveler. The barkeep in the Waxing Crescent Inn … I think his name was Duzal-ja? He has one of them, and can probably tell you where to look for the others. We have to get the relics back before Meldil makes an appearance.",""
"55049764-3-7115","Phenomenal. I knew proximity was the key! And look at you, not even a hint of electrocution.nnYou have the principle. Now, to apply it to the other <<m:1>> before … well, best not to worry you about that.",""
"55049764-3-7117","I know why you originally came hereto ask for the Wilderking's allegiance to the Aldmeri Dominionto know the Valenwood was on your side.nnWould you still make such a request to me now?",""
"55049764-3-7118","I can't believe <<1>> let me stay like this. Come, let's help the old bones drive back the new!",""
"55049764-3-7119","We're almost free! Only one task remains.nnYou must die.",""
"55049764-3-7120","Let's go!",""
"55049764-3-7122","I already told youI'm not going anywhere!nnThe Taskmasters in this place … they can inflict pain that should killbut doesn't. I will not risk getting strung up by them! Not even to escape!",""
"55049764-3-7123","I didn't think we'd survive this day. Many have died, but some live.nnThank you for fighting on our behalf.",""
"55049764-3-7125","You've returned, and this one heard fighting.nnCould … Taskmaster be dead?",""
"55049764-3-7126","The Eight take this thing! Everyone's going to think I'm a thief. An incompetent thief!",""
"55049764-3-7139","Auri-El watch over you. Maybe just tell Malesse my Tacia is adopted? And that I don't want her to feel unwelcome here? I don't know. I don't understand that woman.",""
"55049764-3-7140","Welcome, welcome. We have … lots of interesting people here. Like the merchant, Sarolion. He's certainly got a story or two.",""
"55049764-3-7141","I'm the operations manager for the Summoner Division. I assume you've earned your credentials?",""
"55049764-3-7142","Drauginor's the name. Business manager for the Sorceror Division. Credentials, please.",""
"55049764-3-7143","Zara's tasked me with picking flowers, believe that? I'm a swordsman, not a flower girl! nnDamn my tongue, I can't say no to that girl. It's that purr of hers. Damned distracting.",""
"55049764-3-7144","I see you were successful.",""
"55049764-3-7145","We all saw the corruption draw back. It's such a relief.",""
"55049764-3-7146","This one is relieved to see such estimable help arrive. Raz has already volunteered to enter Hectahame himself, but the queen has forbidden it.",""
"55049764-3-7147","Quite an amazing scene to witness.",""
"55049764-3-7148","It's good to see Akkhuz-ri made it out safe and sound. Gharesh-ri tried to warn him of the danger, but he doesn't always listen. He sometimes forgets he's a spiritual leader and not a hardened warrior.",""
"55049764-3-7149","Shazah has never witnessed such a scene. Kauzanabi-jo thought this experience dangerous, but the history this one has learned. Shazah's sister may disagree, but the trip was well worth it.",""
"55049764-3-7150","Khali wanted to be there, but Lord Gharesh-ri and Kauzanabi-jo wouldn't have it. How does one expand her horizons if no allows Khali to test her skills?",""
"55049764-3-7151","To be trapped outside these walls while the Veiled Heritance destroys more lives.",""
"55049764-3-7154","It's amazing. I can't believe I witnessed the choosing of the Silvenar!",""
"55049764-3-7156","You've proven yourself a valuable member of the Aldmeri Dominion.",""
"55049764-3-7157","Thank the Eight you returned.",""
"55049764-3-7158","I see Elolir is with you. Keep him safe. He's a decent shot, but he's a fool.",""
"55049764-3-7159","Take those Daedra apart. We'll make sure the barricade stays up.nnAnd take care of Laeneval, will you? She's the last healer we have.",""
"55049764-3-7160","You have accomplished a heroic feat today, but there is more to be done.",""
"55049764-3-7161","I suggest we search for survivors. In these situations most people will try to stay hidden. Perhaps the buildings will yield results.",""
"55049764-3-7173","Back, are you? It's your funeral. nnI knew you couldn't be trusted. Now I get to take it out of your hide.",""
"55049764-3-7194","Caldien ….",""
"55049764-3-7198","I'll say a prayer to Y'ffre for my fallen brothers. I hope they'll forgive me for my corwardice. nnThank you once again, traveler.",""
"55049764-3-7208","Mara's grace! I can't tell you how humiliating it is that you had to rescue me yet again. That's the last time. I promise. nnYou need to get the Wards back though, and fast. If my father heard I had one and lost it, he'd put me in the stocks!",""
"55049764-3-7212","They'll come for me soon, and who'll miss me? No one but the rats, I tell you. No one but the rats.nnThey'll come for you too, if you're not careful.",""
"55049764-3-7214","So? Did you convince them? Oh, don't tell me! Talk to Vanus!",""
"55049764-3-7215","You shouldn't be here, traveler.",""
"55049764-3-7216","Is this your land? No? Then leave.",""
"55049764-3-7217","On your way, outsider. You'll never belong here.",""
"55049764-3-7218","Fish aren't for sale. Go catch your own.",""
"55049764-3-7219","The fortress up ahead, they call it the Reaver Citadel. If the Daedra were going for imposing, they damned well succeeded.",""
"55049764-3-7225","My old chum. My bosom companion. My comrade in arms. How long has it been? I've missed you, terribly!nnBy the way, what took you so long? The King is upstairs. He wants to speak to you.",""
"55049764-3-7228","Now comes the true test of your strength and wisdom. Alik'r needs you, <<1>>.nnYou may use the portal behind me to reach the base of the watch.",""
"55049764-3-7229","You return. What have you experienced since last we met?",""
"55049764-3-7230","I'm worried sick about Erinel. I can only pray that whoever hired her kidnappers only wishes to stop the wedding and not worse!",""
"55049764-3-7231","Shall we go and have a proper visit? I'm sure Grunda's prepared something lovely, just for the occasion.",""
"55049764-3-7232","My old life is over. I'll miss Larousse, but these are my people now. I can't just abandon them.",""
"55049764-3-7233","I wish I hadn't run. I'm not a fighter, not like Halalin and Nielas.",""
"55049764-3-7234","You? Who are you?",""
"55049764-3-7235","Still alive. Good.",""
"55049764-3-7239","Hectahame. Lovely isn't it? Especially with its moat of undead and eerily corrupted trees. As much as I know you want to take a peek inside, as long as those wards are up, no one is going anywhere near it.",""
"55049764-3-7242","Has the storm stopped? I don't think I've ever been this sick.",""
"55049764-3-7293","That is all for now. If we have need of you in the future, do not doubt this one will find you.",""
"55049764-3-7294","I'm quite busy at the moment, sorry. I'll be lucky if this haul allows me to keep myself fed, much less pay off my debts. Please leave me to my work.",""
"55049764-3-7296","Did you find out who the Artisan is?",""
"55049764-3-7305","I, Nidras, the Artisan, acknowledge that you rightfully stole my letters, and in exchange for their return, I'll tell you their story.",""
"55049764-3-7313","Hello, hello! This one has tasty foods for the hungry. What can Duzal get you?",""
"55049764-3-7319","Excuse me, sorry. I'm waiting for someone here. Someone who's trying my very last nerve.",""
"55049764-3-7321","Thank you for helping Manthir see how much he loves me. You are the best!",""
"55049764-3-7323","There's more to be done, though. Always is, isn't there?nnPrince Azah's here. He says they've tracked down the third Ansei Ward, and he wants you to join him as soon as possible at the Motalion Necropolis.",""
"55049764-3-7325","I am certain things will return to normal again soon, and these spiders will leave us.nnThey will leave, won't they?",""
"55049764-3-7330","You should've taken the gold.",""
"55049764-3-7333","Yenadar, gone to preach in a High Elf city. Kala is beside herself. Thank you for telling her. This one must arrange passage to the port of Haven at once!",""
"55049764-3-7341","Leave me. I have much to consider.",""
"55049764-3-7343","Apologies, but I must speak to my troops.",""
"55049764-3-7344","Give me a moment to cool down. Talking to those two makes my blood boil.",""
"55049764-3-7360","Don't bring any trouble to <<1>>.",""
"55049764-3-7368","Is there any reason you've chosen to interrupt my thoughts?nnIf so, make it quick. If not, begone.",""
"55049764-3-7369","Valencia wants me to keep playing. So I will. I'll make her proud.",""
"55049764-3-7371","Remove yourself from my presence. You've the stink of this place about you.nnI already can't stand to be here. I don't need … you people clinging to me.",""
"55049764-3-7372","Join the games or join the revelry, sooner or later you'll be back here with a thirst! I just know it. nnWhy not load up now?",""
"55049764-3-7374","The walker is five-clawed after all. Five-clawed, sleek, and fragrant indeed. What will you do, blood-scarred victor? Become drunk and fat?nnThis one hopes not. This one would see you hunt this arena ever more fiercely. It was … an inspiring sight.",""
"55049764-3-7383","This one … feels odd.",""
"55049764-3-7407","So the Veiled Heritance have emerged again in Woodhearth. I see Pelidil and his treachery at the center of this, and once again, you have thwarted his plot. Well done.nnNever mind how this news came to me. My ears now spread throughout Greenshade.",""
"55049764-3-7408","We will never forget how you helped bring peace back to our village.",""
"55049764-3-7411","Please, it wasn't me. How could it be me? I'm a Khajiit. Only Wood Elves can break the Green Pact!",""
"55049764-3-7412","Please take the convicted to judgement, advocate. The wound cannot heal until the burr is removed.",""
"55049764-3-7423","Oh! Hello there. Surprised to see me? So am I, so am I. I do get around, don't I? Haven't the foggiest idea how I do that, quite honestly.",""
"55049764-3-7428","Excellent. Well done. A fantastic experiment, if I do say so myself.",""
"55049764-3-7430","We … we did it. We walked the path and lived. I'm … I'm going to be the Mane. And my sister is dead.",""
"55049764-3-7432","Khalima's life would be unbearable without us.",""
"55049764-3-7437","Get down there and man those ballistae, or that serpent will sink us for sure!",""
"55049764-3-7438","<<1>> has you running all over <<c:2>>. Better you than me.",""
"55049764-3-7439","I heard <<1>> allowed you inside <<c:2>>. Stay on your toes, citizen.",""
"55049764-3-7440","Don't stamp all over the mammoth's tracks! And stand downwind!",""
"55049764-3-7441","Damn troll. Got away again. Impossible to kill. You really got yourself in it this time Ledronor.",""
"55049764-3-7443","The Worm Cultists haven't bothered me in some time. I suppose I have you to thank.nnWait, what happened to <<1>>?",""
"55049764-3-7444","The captain's concerned about <<1>>. She should be! But I spend a lot of time in the crow's nest, so I always try to know what's ahead of me.nnI last saw <<2>> and <<3>> near <<Az:4>>. They may know more about <<5>>'s plans. Neither are mutineers.",""
"55049764-3-7445","So Spinner Eranas was guilty after all. Don't think I'm happy to be proved right. The Spinner's job is to uphold our traditions and pass on our culture to the young. For him to violate the Green Pact … it will take our clan a long time to recover.",""
"55049764-3-7446","The local Altmer still disapprove of our marriage. Quertasse paid someone to steal my censer out of spite. I'm just glad I have Erinel.",""
"55049764-3-7447","I knew it. Gathiel always considered herself above our traditions. A poor match for a Spinner. She deserves what she gets for bringing doom to our village.",""
"55049764-3-7449","Stupid wasp. It keeps getting away from me!",""
"55049764-3-7450","Glaras has been one of Brackenleaf's Briars longer than any of us. She meditates in her tree home, among the trophies of past hunts.",""
"55049764-3-7451","Don't be alarmed if the world around you seems to change. It's a property of the Falinesti Peeper to reveal the true nature of the forest.nnBut be careful, the true nature of the forest can be deadly.",""
"55049764-3-7452","By the Divines, look at these poor souls. I'll bet they were in line to become undead.nnYou and Yahyif go on ahead, find the Master. I'll see if I can get these people some help.",""
"55049764-3-7453","Gedric knows what he's doing. We should press on for Pellingare.",""

"55049764-3-7457","Oh ho. Now, you have seen how the roles of hunter and hunted are interchangeable. You have stalked your prey and confronted your predator.nnYou are almost ready to become a Briar. One last trial remains.",""
"55049764-3-7460","Things are really moving fast now. Further on and further in. nnI'm ready. A little scared. But ready.",""
"55049764-3-7461","I see the time has come. We must climb this Endless Stair and pray we can stop the Planemeld.nnI hope this ends better than my soul-meld fiasco. I'd hate for either Nirn or Coldharbour to survive only to see the other destroyed. Just like poor Zur.",""
"55049764-3-7463","This is truly an honor for me! I don't know what to say. I hope  <<1>> got to hear the news!nnPlease help protect the village now. I'm no longer allowed to leave <<A:2>> while I learn from the old caretaker.",""
"55049764-3-7464","Their main camp is south of this cavern. They've been pouring in that way! Go!",""

"55049764-3-7621","Rest easy, Vestige. We've come a long way, but there is more yet before us. Molag Bal must be thwarted. The Planemeld must be stopped.",""
"55049764-3-7622","Honor and faith to you, my friend. Kasura sends her regards. She is recovering quickly, and reconstruction on the Abbey of Blades has already begun.",""

"55049764-3-7626","You have accepted a contract. The guild expects you to fulfill it.",""
"55049764-3-7627","Personally, I like to crush bandits' skulls with a warhammer. However you do it, kill as many of them as you can.",""

"55049764-3-7656","Please, leave me some room to treat the injured here.nnNot to be rude - bad circumstances for a chat, that's all.",""
"55049764-3-7692","A Bretonwhat was I thinking? I should've known a pretty little Breton lady wasn't interested in me!nnIt was just that we had so much in common. She was quiet, she wanted to be a mage … but it was all a lie! Now I'll be kicked out of the Guild!",""
"55049764-3-7697","I wish I could join you, but … with all those frost trolls, I'd only hold you back.nnYou be careful in that cave, would you?",""
"55049764-3-7699","So the Emerald Chalice turns ordinary people into green Goblins? Remarkable!",""
"55049764-3-7700","Rashan will show you how you can be of assistance.nnDo not be mistaken though, outsider. If you take any action to harm what little nature remains uncorrupted here, she will go straight for your throat.",""
"55049764-3-7701","Who would have guessed it would be an outsider who would show up and kill Uela?nnI doubt this means we'll start inviting families from Evermore out to visit, but maybe, just maybe, we can be a little more friendly.",""
"55049764-3-7702","You travel with <<1>>? He has proven himself a friend to the Falinesti Faithful.nnThere are questions written upon your faces. What is it you seek?",""
"55049764-3-7707","Pox on it! I would've given my axe to have been there when you gave that head to Captain Hjurrun! nnI heard his jaw just about hit the ground. You've given me a good laugh, friend, and a little bit of hope too.",""
"55049764-3-7716","Ah, the queen's champion! Honor to meet you. Means we're that much closer to getting paid. That's good, because I didn't come to Evermore for the women.nnAre you ready then? As long as you're good with the plan, this thing's going to be a breeze.",""
"55049764-3-7717","Hi there. Queen Arzhela told me about all you did for the city. Sounds like they should be building a statue.nnAnyways, compared to what you've already dealt with, this should be a cinch. Really, our part only comes into play if there's a problem.",""
"55049764-3-7719","He took the Walking City? He took my home?nnOr is this another of his lies?",""
"55049764-3-7732","The crypt is to the east, at the top of the stair. Come.",""
"55049764-3-7734","What? Follow me. We'll talk when we reach the … gah … safe spot.",""
"55049764-3-7745","All that's left is to face the Architect. He's defended and he's powerful, but if he can be defeated ….nnYou've made miracles happen today, my friend.",""
"55049764-3-7747","Speak to Rashan.",""
"55049764-3-7748","I must admit, I'm not comfortable with this little jaunt. Sancre Tor is in the mountains of Colovia, and Colovians are the worst kind of Imperialsbackwards mountain men without any sense of decorum. At least Varen will feel right at home.",""
"55049764-3-7752","This is absurd!",""
"55049764-3-7753","I barely made it out of there alive. Those things. They're like nothing I've ever seen.",""
"55049764-3-7756","Another one? Curious. What do you want?",""
"55049764-3-7757","I did what needed to be done. Isabeth knew this. Let's hope her father can open his eyes.",""
"55049764-3-7758","This is Denille's last hope. If this fails, the worst is inevitable.",""
"55049764-3-7760","For the love of Mara, I didn't think I'd see the end of this day. Did Captain Gaercroft, my father, send you?",""
"55049764-3-7762","We couldn't stop those monsters. I fear that soon all of Rivenspire may be lost!",""
"55049764-3-7764","So this trip turned out to be far shorter and far more fortuitous than I expected.nnThat's assuming you're up to the challenge, of course.",""
"55049764-3-7765","I guess it's a good thing we gave the bows to Baandari after all.",""
"55049764-3-7768","I deserve to suffer. All those lives ruined because of my petty need for vengeance. I deserve worse. Leave me be.",""
"55049764-3-7771","You convinced Knight Commander Cheryline to give up the bows? If I had asked her, she wouldn't even have spared me a wooden dagger. nnShe must really like you!",""
"55049764-3-7790","You saw the thief, yes? Or smelled him, perhaps? He was quite filthy. This one will be scrubbing the stench of him out of his clothes for a week, at least!",""
"55049764-3-7791","I'm sorry we can't chat for long. I'm waiting for someone.",""
"55049764-3-7792","The information you have obtained for us is invaluable.nnGo. Do what you must. And be certain that we will do the same.",""
"55049764-3-7794","The Fevered Mews … I haven't thought about that place since I was a child.",""
"55049764-3-7802","Quite the haul for your first day. You don't do anything half way, do you?",""
"55049764-3-7803","Well, all's well that end's well, right? Except for the real mysterywho in Northpoint was pulling Leonce's strings? And why?nnI don't think I'll sleep well until that gets resolved.",""
"55049764-3-7805","Speak of Sheogorath! You've caused quite a stir! Merchants speak of a black wind robbing them blind! Your open hand is blessed on every street corner!nnIf you were looking to make an impression, you have!",""
"55049764-3-7809","I remember now. The translationwe misinterpreted it. We assumed the Crag housed a powerful healing artifact. But we were wrong.nnThe hillside community, though. Why didn't I ever look into that?",""
"55049764-3-7811","When you went below into the crypts this foul icy fog rolled in. The earth shook and those Dolmen emerged from the ground beneath our feet. nnWe retreated here to await your return, the rest you can clearly see.",""
"55049764-3-7813","Hungry … so hungry. A sweetcake would be nice. Candied mammoth tail swimming in sparkle-syrup. Honeyfly bisque over a comb the size of my head … oh, I can almost taste it!",""
"55049764-3-7814","You look like someone who cares about the health of a community. We need more people like you in these troubled times.",""
"55049764-3-7815","Smells good. Maybe, if I wait, they share.",""
"55049764-3-7818","Back of the line, bug nose! I was here first!",""
"55049764-3-7819","There was a time this place was nothin' but a game trail, if you believe it. Blacksaps used to ambush old coins not familiar with the Valenwood.nnThat's where I came in. Know these woods like the back of my hand. Blacksaps never saw us comin'.",""
"55049764-3-7822","If we can't get the information we need, we may be better off barricading Evermore completely and preparing for siege.nnIf you can help, please speak with Captain Gaercroft. We need it.",""
"55049764-3-7823","He sleeps now, thank S'rendarr.",""
"55049764-3-7825","You're such a good person! I know that Puddles will be home in no time now that you're out there looking for her.nnI could see it in her eyes when we arrived. Puddles really wanted to go out and explore this new city. She's very curious, you know.",""
"55049764-3-7828","This place, it speaks to me. It whispers in my ear, sings into my soul. It runs through my blood like cold fire. nnBut none of that matters. When we save Leila, it will all be worth it.",""
"55049764-3-7829","Don't mind Wylon. He's just angry that the shard's effects faded away. He knows you didn't mean for this to happen to me, Verandis.",""
"55049764-3-7833","Looks like you've made your introductions. Time to get to work.",""
"55049764-3-7835","We should honor who the prince was in his life, not the abomination he became in death.nnI will leave you to your mourning.",""

"55049764-3-7852","You're going to the crypt, aren't you? If those churlish rats have raised Eamond, you strike him down. Don't hesitate. nnI loved my husband, but I'd rather see him burned than in that … state. Whatever happens, just make sure I don't see him.",""
"55049764-3-7853","We have enough trouble around here without the noble houses bickering among themselves.",""
"55049764-3-7856","This is no time for idle talk. We need to destroy the Fangs of Chaos to weaken the Dark Anchor!",""
"55049764-3-7857","Greetings, guild-sister. How may I help you?",""
"55049764-3-7858","Ah, my friend! Your return, it is well timed.nnFor some reason, Montclair's forces have attacked the castle. This one can't imagine why they would do such a thing.",""
"55049764-3-7861","Careful! For a moment there, I thought you were the Cloak, coming for Captain Marck. Guess I get kind of jittery in the field.",""
"55049764-3-7862","Say the word and I'll open a portal to <<1>>. Once you pass through, it will seal behind you.nnIf you have anything to do before you leave, now is the time.",""

"55049764-3-7874","Gold. Some people believe we're too obsessed with it, that it controls everything. But I think that's actually a good thing. nnHow else do we create a standard for the value of social and cultural exchange? Gold is the best way. It really is.",""
"55049764-3-7880","<<1>> and his sons rose against the rightful king of the Valenwood. This prison may not be the perfect solution, but it suits them better than a quick death.",""

"55049764-3-7890","I'm surprised you made it. The Houses informed me of what took place in the Doomcrag. Most soldiers would have perished inside of there.nnYet here you stand. Commendable and respectable.",""
"55049764-3-7892","Have you found the crown?",""
"55049764-3-7894","I've said all I'm going to say. We both know this isn't true justice. If your Dominion means what it says, it will give my family a public trial.",""
"55049764-3-7895","My patience wears thin. If this crisis has taught us anything, it's that a nation needs a single ruler. I just hope the High King sees that as well.",""
"55049764-3-7896","The time has come to crown a ruler of Rivenspire. The Light shines on us all, but a nation needs a single leader to look up to.",""
"55049764-3-7898","Tough family, huh? Not sure it was his fault, exactly, but I've been known to do some crazy things for a woman.nnNever anything like this, though. I do have limits, you know.",""
"55049764-3-7899","Lyris has more to tell you, Vestige. Speak with her.",""

"55049764-3-7929","You've returned. What have you learned of the Khajiit Embassy?",""
"55049764-3-7930","I heard what you said to the king. <<1>>, a traitor; my wife's killer, a loyal servant; and I, <<2>>'s representative in <<3>>, required to thank you for your efforts.nnVery well. I'll provide no reason to question my duty to the Dominion.",""
"55049764-3-7935","My friend <<1>> has gone missing, and I'm worried he got himself into trouble inside the cave to the north.",""

"55049764-3-7957","What happened to our family is terrible, but as the bards say, life goes on.nnMy sister and I came up here to … well, to give them a proper burial.",""
"55049764-3-7958","Why? Why did they have to leave us?",""
"55049764-3-7960","I think that Countess Tamrith and Baron Dorell both could be excellent rulers. The important thing is that we crown someone. And today must be the day.",""

"55049764-3-7985","Fortunately, I'm on the stealthy side. That's not Snaruga's way, though.nnThe old girl gave the Imperials too many black eyes. They dare not trust her with a pick!",""

"55049764-3-8040","The falls you seek are southwest of here, overlooking Gil-Var-Delle. Simply let some of the water from the vial fall at each crest, and the flow will carry it across Gil-Var-Delle so that the earth may drink and be cleansed.",""
"55049764-3-8044","Even with a single performer back on the job, I see smiling faces. I think we're starting to draw a crowd!nnWhatever you've been doing, keep doing it!",""

"55049764-3-8059","As soon as he gets home, I'm going to give my husband a piece of my mind. Edouard will be lucky if I don't throw him out after all this trouble.",""
"55049764-3-8068","I apologive profusely for the burden that escorting <<1>> surely inflicted upon you.nnI will safeguard him from here, so that he takes nothing of this place with him aside from stories.",""

"55049764-3-8072","Ah yes, I recall you from before. You failed to find the relic I was hunting in the Alik'r. At least you didn't fail to find <<1>>.nnI don't suppose you'd be willing to help me find something else, just to prove you're not entirely inept?",""
"55049764-3-8078","An abandoned house. Lovely. One day, my dear, you'll need to take me somewhere nice.nnWell, let's go investigate.",""
"55049764-3-8082","That's an interesting story. If Naruk had Kaleen under duress, wouldn't she alert the guard? Now I'm curious.",""
"55049764-3-8084","Thank you. A find like this is incredibly rare. It could greatly advance our understanding of the Valenwood Ayleids and their unique dialect. I must begin translating immediately!",""
"55049764-3-8088","No. Don't tell me he's dead. He can't be.",""

"55049764-3-8136","Hello there. I suggest you don't try to pick me up. You'll only injure your back.nnDon't ask for any long-winded explanations either. It's tiring to talk when you're made of iron.",""
"55049764-3-8137","The tension between the locals and the Imperials makes it difficult to concentrate.",""
"55049764-3-8138","Hold it. You're not working for the Imperials are you?",""
"55049764-3-8139","<<1>> believes we Covenant troops require a symbol to rally behind, but he is mistaken. nnThe Old Tower is occupied by an Imperial Cohort. No stolen hat will change those odds.",""
"55049764-3-8146","I do not know if <<1>> will last much longer. nnBring him this thing he yearns for, that he may feel victory in his hands once more before embracing a warrior's death.",""
"55049764-3-8164","Halt there. Bangkorai Garrison is on lockdown since the death of King Eamond. Only Knights of Saint Pelin and members of the royal family are allowed in.nnAlso, if you were planning on going to Evermore, you might want to reconsider that.",""
"55049764-3-8170","It sounds archaic, but the Blacklight Raiders were well-roundedwarrior, cleric, thief, and mage.nnThe mage wrote a letter to one of the others telling how to open the lockbox. Between the letter and the gravestones, I hope we can solve it.",""

"55049764-3-8204","Well met, friend. I've heard a lot about you!",""
"55049764-3-8213","This is hopeless! Baron Montclair forces me to mix concoctions that I know won't do any good.nnIf he'd just listen to me,  I could show him exactly how to heal his wife and end her suffering.",""
"55049764-3-8215","Well scamp, you don't look any worse for wear. Maybe you should put the ale down every once in a while and pick up a sword. Hah!",""
"55049764-3-8224","How are you doing, milksop? Kill any big scary monsters this week?",""
"55049764-3-8226","They say it may take weeks for the performers to start their shows back up, but I am worried if I leave I'll miss it.",""

"55049764-3-8281","Ah, our magnanimous prince. Such a kind and noble ruler, don't you agree?",""
"55049764-3-8283","Fine, I stand corrected. You weren't just trying to trick me.nnYou've got my thanks, for whatever that's worth. Now that <<1>> is dead, the rest of us should be able to hold out until reinforcements arrive.",""
"55049764-3-8294","Your drunken exploits gave the bards much to work with. I think your battle with the giant will make a fine song. Still, I am sorry for this inconvenience.",""

"55049764-3-8320","What in Oblivion do you want? nnUnless you can haul it yourself, don't tell me you have a load of grain that needs to be ground at the mill. The constable's deputy just confiscated my damn wagon.",""

"55049764-3-8336","Talk to Skordo. He has a plan. It's a bit crude, but it just might work.nnAt least, it has the advantage of being remarkably simple and easy to remember. I appreciate that in a plan.",""
"55049764-3-8341","I see plenty of Montclair's monsters, but no survivors. Let's keep looking.",""
"55049764-3-8342","It has been a grueling day. Restock and rest. We'll begin the march to the Doomcrag when you're ready.",""
"55049764-3-8343","Some of my soldiers seem to be having second thoughts about our grand purpose. About the faith that guides us through the darkness.nnI really don't have time for such distractions right now!",""
"55049764-3-8345","We need to find the others before it's too late. Lead the way upstairs, but stay alert.",""
"55049764-3-8346","We are lucky you came along when you did. Had you been but a moment later … I hate to think what might have happened.",""
"55049764-3-8347","It's so strange to have Federic return after all this time only to leave again. But I think I'm done being lonely. <<1>> has been wonderful to me. It's time I gave her a chance.",""

"55049764-3-8417","Use the torch to burn the dead. I'll follow behind you and perform the ritual of sanctification.",""

"55049764-4-1387","Remember; keep your distance until you can get a clear path to the braziers. The Ashlanders might look the innocent type, but you disgrace their Prince and they'll stomp you. This of course would cause quite a commotion and that's not what we want.",""

"55049764-4-1870","You've returned! I believe Barnabe and Geon have been busying themselves with swordplay. For awhile, all we heard was cursing and sword-clashing, but moments ago... silence.",""

"55049764-4-3485","My brother and I will pack up here and follow behind you.nnAny harpies you catch in the throwing snare, we'll be sure to haul in and get back to camp.",""
"55049764-4-3486","Well! I didn't think she'd kill him. That wasn't what I planned.nnStill, he got what he deserved.",""
"55049764-4-3493","You have returned. And you are victorious. Just as I have foreseen it.",""
"55049764-4-3500","Those soldiers tried to kill <<1>>, but she got them first. She said she was going to hide in a house north of the temple until she could strike back. nnI can't let her risk herself like that. What am I to do?",""
"55049764-4-3502","Thanks to you, Aswala Stables has been saved!nnWe won't forget what you've done for us.",""
"55049764-4-3505","Please finish this. Retrieve the sword from the chapel and take it to the burial vault where Rosalind died.nnDo what I cannot and face my poor wife's shade.",""
"55049764-4-3506","We're safe for the moment, Captain. Go find your husband.",""
"55049764-4-3517","Dresan Keep you said …. Why does that sound familiar to me?",""
"55049764-4-3521","Fried fire salts! This is way worse than I realized. nnThe Withered Hand, eh? When I get back to the tower, I'll see if I have anything on them … it'll be useful when you come ask for my help again, which I'm sure you will.",""
"55049764-4-3522","I pray that we are not too late to stop the Withered Hand, and with the same breath, I thank the gods for guiding you here.nnTu'whacca watch over you, wayfarer.",""
"55049764-4-3523","Good to see you again. We owe you a great deal, you know.",""
"55049764-4-3524","Well done. When we get back to town, I'll raise a tankard in your name.",""
"55049764-4-3525","Thanks to you, the source of the Daedric threat is gone. When my sword arm recovers, I'll join the hunt for those Withered Hand scum. I will not rest until the sands of Alik'r are stained with their blood!nnGo with Onsi's blessing, <<1>>.",""
"55049764-4-3526","I've heard a lot of greetings, but that one's new to me.",""
"55049764-4-3530","I'm afraid there isn't much time. nnWe expect Faolchu to launch a full-scale assault at any moment.",""
"55049764-4-3531","You're back! Tell me, what did you see?",""
"55049764-4-3536","I think one of those spiders bit me. I feel a little woozy.nn<<1>> … sounds familiar but I can't put my finger on it.",""
"55049764-4-3540","Meet us at the ritual site. And don't forget the lurcher.",""
"55049764-4-3546","It is well, but there is more to do. We cannot rest just yet.",""
"55049764-4-3547","You did it. You killed Faolchu.",""
"55049764-4-3552","I have realized what I must do. nnI will build a shrine to honor my fellow priests that were slain here … it will be an everlasting testament to their sacrifice and to the temple's ability to persevere.",""
"55049764-4-3553","Wonderful! We'll slip past their very noses. Just like in the stories!",""
"55049764-4-3554","Risking danger just to recover trinkets for me. Our family will always remember this.",""
"55049764-4-3555","We are in your debt, friend. I hope you made Angof suffer before you finished him!",""
"55049764-4-3557","You made it. No zombie bites or anything.",""
"55049764-4-3559","Camlorn is free! It may take a while, but we're going to recover from Faolchu's vile touch.",""
"55049764-4-3560","These cursed werewolves. I just …. nnHow in Oblivion did you get in here?",""
"55049764-4-3562","Thank you for directing the women here. They will be well cared for.",""
"55049764-4-3564","Sanded maple. Open your journal. Recipe is inside.",""
"55049764-4-3569","Father's at peace now. I need a change of scenery, so I'm going to Stormhaven.nnMaybe I'll see you there one of these days.",""
"55049764-4-3570","You and Tamien handle whatever's going on in the house. I'll play lookout and make sure no one sneaks up on you.",""
"55049764-4-3571","If you truly offer your assistance, I welcome it readily. Our numbers are weakened by the poison used against my people.nnI'm not sure how much longer we can keep the undead at bay.",""
"55049764-4-3574","Please. Go away! There is … nothing you can say that willl console me.nnMy sweet Casnar is either dead, or he's decided he doesn't love me!  I-I don't know which is worse!",""
"55049764-4-3575","Must be nice. Being able to just walk out of here and do whatever you want.",""
"55049764-4-3581","We'll need all the armor and weapons you can find. nnJust think how grateful some of these sweet young citizens will be.",""
"55049764-4-3586","Activate the stones in the four huts. My sisters need a safe place to work.",""
"55049764-4-3591","The workers owe you their lives. I pray you're not too late to rescue the dockmaster. nnBahir may be old, but he's got a spark to him. If these risen dead weren't of our people, I've no doubt he could hold his own.",""
"55049764-4-3592","So far, it's been rough trying to get anyone to listen. I hope you're having better luck than me.",""
"55049764-4-3597","We established a perimeter around the village. Nothing that comes this way will get past us.nnBut we can't cover the docks. I don't have enough soldiers for that.",""
"55049764-4-3598","Unfamiliar with Sentinel?nnThe inn is just east of here. The smithy is on the far east side. The alchemist is in the market, just south of the inn.",""
"55049764-4-3602","The cure won't work unless the werewolves are weakened first. nnRemember. Weaken them, then use the antidote. Send anyone who's cured back here.",""
"55049764-4-3607","You're going to help us, eh?nnI could have figured this out, you know. If I could find a way to weigh the harpy down so it'd trigger the trap … you know what? It's probably better that you take care of this.",""
"55049764-4-3613","Very few outside of the royal family have been inside that crypt, <<1>>. You should feel honored that <<2>> chose you for this task.nnDo you have the amulet?",""
"55049764-4-3627","Collect the keys and bring Anton's jeweled crown to me. I'll reward you handsomely. nnEven better, I'll mention you in my next book.",""
"55049764-4-3629","Friend, I am blessed that you came along.nnIf you could discover the young soldier's fate, I would be in your debt.",""
"55049764-4-3632","I overheard what the archmagister said. You need someone from Padesh's family as a sacrifice.nnI'm ready.",""
"55049764-4-3633","Have you chosen your sacrifice?nnIs it <<1>> or <<2>>?",""
"55049764-4-3634","You took back my city.nnWe will rebuild and Camlorn will rise again. Thank you for everything you've done.",""
"55049764-4-3635","Ha! Now you're just showing off. nnBut I'm glad to see you alive and well. Darien, too. Tamriel would be a poorer place without the two of you in it.",""
"55049764-4-3636","I have failed everyone!",""
"55049764-4-3647","This plan sounds crazy, but I wish you both luck.nnGuard Scholar Dariya with your life.",""
"55049764-4-3651","I tried to stop him, but it was all I could do just to keep him from killing Father Quiston!nnDamn it all! What are we going to do now?",""
"55049764-4-3652","Now comes the time to prove yourself, <<1>>.nnYour strength and wisdom is needed elsewhere in Alik'r.",""
"55049764-4-3653","<<1>> must be stopped. What he is doing is a crime against the Divines!",""
"55049764-4-3654","I cannot help you against the Imperials until the souls of my retainers are safe.nnPlease find them soon.",""
"55049764-4-3670","I think perhaps I had our assignments wrong. I should've checked the stocks and sent you to check the ship.",""
"55049764-4-3674","Thank you for dealing with this small matter for me.nnI'm afraid <<1>> has me overtasked at the moment.",""
"55049764-4-3675","The wells are in the Imperial camp north of us. <<1>> is usually in the northeast part of the camp. Good riddance to him.nn<<2>> … I don't know how to say this, but you're the first person I've ever trusted. Thank you for helping me.",""
"55049764-4-3683","Come now, I don't expect that switch is just going to throw itself. nnIf you'll get the switch, I'll go on into the chamber. Then you can just meet me inside.",""
