"115740052-0-18392","This one hears that people are fleeing Longhaven.",""
"115740052-0-18393","I've heard the same. Bad business that. They say people are disappearing on the moors.",""
"115740052-0-18394","Dark moons! This one feels nothing but pity, nothing but pity.",""
"115740052-0-18395","Jone and Jode! This one hears there were vampires discovered in Longhaven!",""
"115740052-0-18396","Aye, a Dunmer vampire hunter and another hero drove them out and dispelled the evil mist from the moors.",""
"115740052-0-18397","Good. This one couldn't rest easy, knowing there's vampires around.",""
"115740052-0-18398","This way. I'm in here.","Da questa parte. Sono qui."
"115740052-0-18399","What's happening? I hear the Thalmor has issued a call to arms.","Che sta succedendo? Ho sentito che i Thalmor hanno indetto una chiamata alle armi."
"115740052-0-18400","Aye, and Treethane Fariel has sent word to the other Treethanes. It's a Maormer invasion.",""
"115740052-0-18401","Ahhh!",""
"115740052-0-18402","Maormer? Where?","Maormer? Dove?"
"115740052-0-18403","Seaside Sanctuary. Rumor has it the Veiled Heritance is involved, too. Those traitors just won't give up.","Seaside Sanctuary. Voci dicono che anche la Eredità Velata è coinvolta. Quei traditori non sanno arrendersi."
"115740052-0-18404","Did you hear? The Maormer are defeated!","Hai sentito? I Maormer sono sconfitti!"
"115740052-0-18405","Indeed. Treethane Fariel has issued word saying Vicereeve Pelidil was responsible.",""
"115740052-0-18406","That toad? Really?",""
"115740052-0-18407","I just hope this is the end of the Veiled Heritance. We have too many external enemies to fight ourselves.",""
"115740052-0-18408","The queen should be here any moment … I hope, at least.",""
"115740052-0-18409","Chim-el Adabal. The Amulet of the Kings of Glory. An artifact of the Divines, a badge of office for the ruling emperors of Cyrodiil, and the key to my ascendancy. Yet it eludes me.",""
"115740052-0-18410","Exploiting its power to bring about the calamity of our age was intoxicating. It made me aware of the limitless possibilities available to one strong enough, and fearless enough, to use it to achieve his own ends.",""
"115740052-0-18411","The Amulet has the power to create or destroy. But it also has the power to undo the damage caused by the Soulburst, to mend the tear in the barrier between Nirn and Oblivion.nnI must recover it before some fool fixes that which must remain broken.",""
"115740052-0-18412","I never thought I'd see so many strangers in Valenwood.",""
"115740052-0-18413","These are frightening times. We must all band together.",""
"115740052-0-18414","True enough. I worry about my sister. She's stationed at the Moonhenge Outpost, and there's been rumors of Daedric activity there for some time.",""
"115740052-0-18415","Daedra? Auri-El help us!",""
"115740052-0-18416","Can you believe what happened at Moonhenge?",""
"115740052-0-18417","I heard. A Daedric invasion in the Ayleid ruins.",""
"115740052-0-18418","I heard that a scout team entered the Daedric portal and found an exact copy of Moonhenge on the other side. They had to destroy it all to close the portal.",""
"115740052-0-18419","We're lucky to have such heroes.",""
"115740052-0-18420","He knows of our plan to use the amulet to set things right! We must rescue Sai Sahan before he can be broken.",""
"115740052-0-18421","Have you heard what's happening to the Heart of Valenwood? Undead everywhere. They say Prince Naemon's involved.",""
"115740052-0-18422","I thought Prince Naemon was dead.",""
"115740052-0-18423","They say he's come back as a lich, and he's raising an undead army in Hectahame, and corrupting the Heart in the process! If it's true, it'll destroy Valenwood.",""
"115740052-0-18424","Y'ffre save us from undead armies and Altmeri royal feuds!",""
"115740052-0-18425","Did you hear Queen Ayrenn's latest proclamation? Her brother is to be interred shortly. A royal funeral.",""
"115740052-0-18426","After all the trouble he's caused?",""
"115740052-0-18427","It wasn't him. They've uncovered papers belonging to Pelidil and Kinlady Estre showing that they conspired with the Veiled Heritance to raise Naemon from the dead and use him as a figurehead.",""
"115740052-0-18428","There's no sin an Altmer can't erase with a little paperwork, eh?",""
"115740052-0-18429","Head up the stairs and through the door. My construct will join you shortly.",""
"115740052-0-18430","How were they able to penetrate the ward? It does not seem possible!",""
"115740052-0-18431","Sai, the Titan returns!",""
"115740052-0-18432","Vestige! Now is the time! You must ascend the path and face the Daedric Prince!",""
"115740052-0-18433","I'm sorry, old friends. Did you take a wrong turn? Allow me to raise a few servants to make your stay here more  … comfortable.",""
"115740052-0-18434","Clear! Take up positions!",""
"115740052-0-18435","I don't like this. Where's the Magus-General? It's not like a Tharn to be late.",""
"115740052-0-18436","I won't sit here and let you do all the work!",""
"115740052-0-18437","Impatience is hardly the mark of a strong ruler, Your Majesty.",""
"115740052-0-18438","I congratulate you, little insect. Your sting is formidable.",""
"115740052-0-18439","You have bested me and released a thousand times a thousand souls back into the Mundus.",""
"115740052-0-18440","For the moment, your world is spared, but my grand scheme has only begun to unfold. Excellent. Your power shall prove useful in the coming conflicts.",""
"115740052-0-18441","You have a powerful ally. Did you know that she would bring you here? What future role has she to play in this grand, cosmic farce, I wonder?",""
"115740052-0-18442","The dark machinations of Oblivion are far more complex than anything your mortal senses can comprehend.",""
"115740052-0-18443","You've made a great and terrible enemy this day. Your world would have been better off if the Planemeld had succeeded. Had you bowed before me and accepted eternal servitude, I would have protected you. There are worse masters than I. Far worse.",""
"115740052-0-18444","You are but a phantom here in my domain, Stone-Fire. The mortal prophecies of the Scrolls have been fulfilled. Leave this place and return to your pit!",""
"115740052-0-18445","When you're queen, you're welcome to set a finer example, Magus-General.",""
"115740052-0-18446","Bah! Your meddling has already cost me too much, accursed creature of light and flame. This farce no longer amuses me.",""
"115740052-0-18447","That's one honor I do not seek. What I do seek, is the unconditional surrender of Evermore.",""
"115740052-0-18448","Gods, that felt good!",""
"115740052-0-18449","Vestige! Take the Amulet of Kings while I summon a portal!",""
"115740052-0-18450","You came all this way just to make absurd demands? I'm surprised.",""
"115740052-0-18451","Hardly absurd, Arzhela. I tried the soft approach with the duke, but you spoiled that effort. I've come to make one final offer: surrender, or you will die.",""
"115740052-0-18452","Your threats carry little weight, Septima. Bangkorai Garrison still stands between us, and it does not fall easily, or did you miss that in your history lessons?",""
"115740052-0-18453","Those who hide in the shadows of the past are crushed when its structures come tumbling down … Bangkorai Garrison has already fallen. My legionnaires walk its battlements even now.",""
"115740052-0-18454","Is this another of your lies? I don't care. It's clear you want a war. And if that's what you want, you can have it!",""
"115740052-0-18455","What the … ? She's not even here! It's an illusion!",""
"115740052-0-18456","Ha! Just remember, you struck first, Arzhela. Seventh Legion—Attack!",""
"115740052-0-18457","Let's go!",""
"115740052-0-18458","Ambush! Defend the queen at all cost.",""
"115740052-0-18459","Fried fire salts! They're coming all right. Don't forget, we're looking to you to direct our spells. Don't worry about targeting over our allies. I promise, we won't fry the queen. Everyone—call them out when you see them!",""
"115740052-0-18460","Medya's here! Come quickly, she's not—",""
"115740052-0-18461","There's Indaenir now.",""
"115740052-0-18462","How have we returned? The last thing I remember was being overwhelmed!",""
"115740052-0-18463","Right. Sorry about that. I called in a bit of help to pull you out of there. I do hope I didn't overstep my bounds.",""
"115740052-0-18464","He is gone! Molag Bal no longer touches my mind! I'm finally free of him!",""
"115740052-0-18465","My Lord Varen, are you injured?",""
"115740052-0-18466","I'm fine, Sai. But where is Tharn? I do not hear his steps or his breath.",""
"115740052-0-18467","Sad, isn't it? The poor child.",""
"115740052-0-18468","He vanished. Ran off, I think. And he took the amulet you chaps found, with him.",""
"115740052-0-18469","I cannot believe Snow Lily is gone. Why did she do it, My Lord?",""
"115740052-0-18470","Here now, my good man! Lyris Titanborn is a hero! She gave her life for a noble cause!",""
"115740052-0-18471","Sir Cadwell is right, Sai. We will all mourn her, but it was her choice. Her sacrifice to make.",""
"115740052-0-18472","I cannot believe she is really gone.",""
"115740052-0-18473","Do not despair, Sai Sahan, son of Yokuda. Lyris Titanborn's sacrifice brought about the salvation of your world.",""
"115740052-0-18474","Who comes here? Which Daedric Prince is this?",""
"115740052-0-18475","You know me as Meridia. I appear to you in a form you can understand, but I cannot stay long. nnThis page of history is concluded, but there are many more chapters to be written. I must leave you now, but will be watching.",""
"115740052-0-18476","What … what happened? How did we get here? I remember being overwhelmed, but then ….",""
"115740052-0-18477","Right. Sorry about that. I called in a bit of help to pull you out of there. I do hope I didn't overstep my bounds.",""
"115740052-0-18478","Snow Lily, I ….",""
"115740052-0-18479","I know, Sai. It's over. It's all over.",""
"115740052-0-18480","Well then! Happy endings all around! Smashing! Who's got the brandy?",""
"115740052-0-18481","Wait, where is Tharn? Did he survive?",""
"115740052-0-18482","He vanished. Ran off, I think. And he took the amulet you chaps found, with him.",""
"115740052-0-18483","Your questions are many, but there is little time to answer them all. Your companion knows the truth of things.",""
"115740052-0-18484","Ah! Radiant Meridia! So good to see you again, my lady. Truly!",""
"115740052-0-18485","Yes, you know me as Meridia. I appear to you in a form you can understand, but I cannot stay long. nnThis page of history is concluded, but there are many more chapters to be written. I must leave you now, but will be watching.",""
"115740052-0-18486","The forest feels your weakness, Sentinel. This is treacherous ground.",""
"115740052-0-18487","Enter, Demara. Was that a warning, or a threat?",""
"115740052-0-18488","Stenwick, who's this? A wyress?",""
"115740052-0-18489","Yes, child. You will know more of them soon enough.",""
"115740052-0-18490","Is that so? You're more foolish than I thought, old man.",""
"115740052-0-18491","Don't think anything of this. The Wyrd are a strange folk.",""
"115740052-0-18492","The scents of the Harborage fill the air. But what happened? How did we return? Lyris? Lyris, are you there?",""
"115740052-0-18493","Not to worry, not to worry! Lyris is fit as a fiddle, and you all seem quite intact, as well.",""
"115740052-0-18494","I'm here, sire. But where's Tharn?",""
"115740052-0-18495","He vanished. Ran off, I think. And he took the amulet you chaps found, with him.",""
"115740052-0-18496","That bastard! Sai died for that Amulet!",""
"115740052-0-18497","The Amulet's power is expended for generations to come. It will be of no use to him, now.",""
"115740052-0-18498","Things feel different. Molag Bal's hold on my mind has been lifted. I am finally free of him!",""
"115740052-0-18499","You are free indeed, Varen Aquilarios. Free of the calamity your hubris brought upon this world. Free of the Daedric Prince, Molag Bal.",""
"115740052-0-18500","I am the one you call Meridia. I appear to you in a form you can understand, but I cannot stay long. nnThis page of history is concluded, but there are many more chapters to be written. I must leave you now, but will be watching.",""
"115740052-0-18501","<<1>>, I've been thinking. <<2>> can't truly appreciate your gift. But if you brought me to the Shivering Isles, I'd fit right in!",""
"115740052-0-18502","Sheo, please, I realized why you are upset. Let's leave this place. Take me to the Shivering Isles and let's never look back.",""
"115740052-0-18503","You want to go where you're like all the others? Where you can be a shank of bacon in a house built of bacon shanks?",""
"115740052-0-18504","No! I mean, think of how I could use your gift in a place that truly understood me.",""
"115740052-0-18505","Well, I suppose you'd make a fine addition to the garden. Very well! The killing's off. Couldn't bring you to my home with more holes in you than when we first met. Just not proper.",""
"115740052-0-18506","By the sword of my father, Nazir Itaf Sahan, I pledge myself to the destruction of Mannimarco and the liberation of Tamriel from the tyranny of the God of Schemes, Molag Bal!","Per la spada di mio padre, Nazir Itaf Sahan, dedico la mia vita alla distruzione di Mannimarco e la liberazione di Tamriel dalla tirannia del Dio degli Intrighi, Molag Bal!"
"115740052-0-18507","Thank you, <<1>>! Thank you so much. I can't wait to see my new home.",""
"115740052-0-18508","I'll send you ahead. I need a moment to speak with my second favorite mortal. Don't mind the grummites! They always smell that way.",""
"115740052-0-18509","I knew you would lead me to the ring, eventually. Give it to me!",""
"115740052-0-18510","Your presence defiles this place, Mannimarco!",""
"115740052-0-18511","You've done it! Grab <<1>> so you might free me.",""
"115740052-0-18512","Give me the ring and I might spare your pathetic lives!",""
"115740052-0-18513","Rise, yes! Your bones will bow to the Black Worm!",""
"115740052-0-18514","Even death bows before me!",""
"115740052-0-18515","Don't be a stranger!",""
"115740052-0-18516","We struck down your Titan and we'll strike you down soon enough!",""
"115740052-0-18517","If you have something to say, you'll say it to my face!",""
"115740052-0-18518","The Titan was a prelude of what's to come if you continue to defy me!",""
"115740052-0-18519","I will. You are weak. Fit for little more than prey. How do you hope to wield the Sentinel's power?",""
"115740052-0-18520","I'll see you in Coldharbour, friend.",""
"115740052-0-18521","Stenwick is trying to save my life! I don't know what he has planned, but I certainly owe it to him to see this through!",""
"115740052-0-18522","Defy you? Your delusions of godhood are laughable, you ignominious corpse-herder!",""
"115740052-0-18523","The child knows nothing. And he expects us to offer our blessing?",""
"115740052-0-18524","Very well, then. I'll simply take the ring from your corpses.",""
"115740052-0-18525","Kneel before me!",""
"115740052-0-18526","I betrayed them, and I would do it all again, if it pleases Master Grexev.",""
"115740052-0-18527","Enough. Come, let us finish the blessing and be done with it.",""
"115740052-0-18528","Ngh!",""
"115740052-0-18529","Run!",""
"115740052-0-18530","Eeyai!",""
"115740052-0-18531","You need to leave. I am the chieftain here! Master Grexev has made it so!",""
"115740052-0-18532","Perhaps if this one kills you, Master Grexev will bring greater wealth.",""
"115740052-0-18533","The Worm Cult approaches! Come, outsider. Help us to throw them back!",""
"115740052-0-18534","That can't be the last of them! It's a break though. I'll open a portal to get us down to the queen!",""
"115740052-0-18535","Herd Mother, hear my call. My sons have travelled too far.",""
"115740052-0-18536","Your sons have wandered beyond my reach, but not beyond hope. I would speak with the one who has been helping you.",""
"115740052-0-18537","All right, sisters. Let us begin the ritual.",""
"115740052-0-18538","It's your moment. Go ahead. Throw the heart into the circle.",""
"115740052-0-18539","This'll just take a moment.",""
"115740052-0-18540","Took more out of me than I thought! Go on, give it to the poor girl. I'll be all right.",""
"115740052-0-18541","Saryne! I've brought help!",""
"115740052-0-18542","This is my chance! Release me from this body, please!",""
"115740052-0-18543","Through that gate lies the Crypt of Heroes. We can enter, if you wish. But it is a foul place, where the dead are restless and angry.",""
"115740052-0-18544","Now, we have only to consecrate the second shrine before we can enter the vault.",""
"115740052-0-18545","You certainly did a thorough job hiding the amulet, Sai. Couldn't you have just stuffed it in a mattress or something?",""
"115740052-0-18546","The second shrine is in the chamber beyond. There is a trick to reaching it, a puzzle of sorts, but I do not recall its solution.",""
"115740052-0-18547","Thank you! Thank you … I thought I would never be free.",""
"115740052-0-18548","What are you doing to my clothes?",""
"115740052-0-18549","It worked! The little bugger's already thriving again! The power of nature is truly miraculous.",""
"115740052-0-18550","Leaving? I trust your judgment, but we shouldn't let this wait too long. I'll do what I can in your absence.",""
"115740052-0-18551","That was a nightmare.",""
"115740052-0-18552","I can't believe I bought one of those imperial spies a drink!",""
"115740052-0-18553","Me neither! You should have known better when he started mouthing off about how Cyrodilic ales were the best in Tamriel.",""
"115740052-0-18554","Well I ….",""
"115740052-0-18555","Or when he started whispering about how the Queen wasn't fit to rule.",""
"115740052-0-18556","But I ….",""
"115740052-0-18557","Or when he started handing out pamphlets about the benefits of being an Imperial territory.",""
"115740052-0-18558","Ugh … I always thought I was so perceptive.",""
"115740052-0-18559","Garel, you know I love you like a sister, but you're about as perceptive as an elf with cropped ears.",""
"115740052-0-18560","My magicka is almost depleted. It's going to take all I've got to open a portal back to the palace. Be ready!",""
"115740052-0-18561","At last, I'm nearly free!",""
"115740052-0-18562","Can't you cast any faster, Gabrielle? The Imperials can. More portals opening up!",""
"115740052-0-18563","Have you given our petition to the Queen yet?",""
"115740052-0-18564","Yes … and despite my strong objections, Her Royal Highness, Queen Arzhela, has elected to give each of you refugees a hearing where you might air your grievances.",""
"115740052-0-18565","Is that so? When?",""
"115740052-0-18566","Whenever time permits. Count yourself lucky that she's even taken an interest in this shanty town. Were the Duke still in power, you'd probably be in an Imperial prison camp by now.",""
"115740052-0-18567","Well it's good to have a Queen who actually cares about her people. It's a pity that we don't have a guard sergeant who feels the same way….",""
"115740052-0-18568","Believe me, there is nothing I'd fancy more than returning you to your homes. The sooner we can start cleaning up your rubbish the better.",""
"115740052-0-18569","The portal to Evermore … go, Your Majesty, go!",""
"115740052-0-18570","Oh, that was exciting! And depressing. Poor Aulie, never could finish what he started. You really are a joy to watch!",""
"115740052-0-18571","Reynelle my dear. How do you fare?",""
"115740052-0-18572","Gasteau? I'm fine, thanks to our friends. Is this … an attempt to escape?",""
"115740052-0-18573","There's a chance, my dear. There's a chance. If our friends here are as powerful they seem.",""
"115740052-0-18574","Your plan is to fight the Architect directly? Haven't we done enough to him?",""
"115740052-0-18575","Have we done enough to him? He's tortured us every day since our imprisonment!  You think his actions are just?",""
"115740052-0-18576","No, but I can understand his anger. We ruined him, Gasteau.",""
"115740052-0-18577","I would do it again this instant if I could! Look around, Reynelle—he's a villain. These Vaults of Madness justify anything we've done to him!",""
"115740052-0-18578","So these motes are all that's left of dear Stenwick ….",""
"115740052-0-18579","What's that sound? Can you hear it?",""
"115740052-0-18580","By Mauloch, It's good to be able to look up to a clear sky.",""
"115740052-0-18581","I heard the crows were being controlled by a Hagraven out in Jackdaw Cove.",""
"115740052-0-18582","That would make sense. Afterall, I did see a whole mess of them tear a man to pieces right in front of me.",""
"115740052-0-18583","I've got to be a bit more careful with my bets. I put money on every Orc I see come through, and half the time they go into that rage of theirs and forget they need their own blood to live.",""
"115740052-0-18584","Oh, not this story again! Look, the important thing is that she's dead.",""
"115740052-0-18585","You should watch them spar, you know. Spend less time drinking and think of this arena as a business venture—you'll do better. I haven't lost a bet in some time because I monitor my investments.",""
"115740052-0-18586","Well the bird-catchers won't like it, but whomever killed that monster is a hero through and through. Evermore might survive after all.",""
"115740052-0-18587","Excuse me, did you know my husband?",""
"115740052-0-18588","That's the difference between us, Carilasse, it's always business for you. Learn how to lose a bet sometime, it's not like you're desperate for money!",""
"115740052-0-18589","I think I'm better now. Gods, what is this place?",""
"115740052-0-18590","Lady <<1>>. You denied my love, and now I deny your journey home. If you beg my forgiveness … convincingly … I'll return the Walking City from where I stole it.",""
"115740052-0-18591","Please, hurry! I'm not sure how long I can survive down here.",""
"115740052-0-18592","I … I can't ….",""
"115740052-0-18593","My head … so dizzy … I'm all right, I'm all right.",""
"115740052-0-18594","Is my ear bleeding? Everything seems bright … this can't be good.",""
"115740052-0-18595","Despite the dishonorable acts of traitors and cowards, Fell's Run will go on! We will heal this rift and grow stronger as a community.",""
"115740052-0-18596","We are stronger than our enemies. Just as the alliance makes the Daggerfall Covenant powerful, our mingled community makes Fell's Run great. We will get past this. We will prosper!",""
"115740052-0-18597","Well, good job, Marcella. You finally burned down the whole wamasu pen. Now what do we do?",""
"115740052-0-18598","Thank you. I hope to see you back at the camp.",""
"115740052-0-18599","How about we do not speak of it? At all. Just drop the whole matter entirely.",""
"115740052-0-18600","As you like. You know, this is perhaps the second time this has happened to this one.",""
"115740052-0-18601","Elgenie's outdone herself.",""
"115740052-0-18602","Who are you? What brings you into my home?",""
"115740052-0-18603","Already bored! Here, I brought you some presents. The shiny ones are always the best, wouldn't you say?",""
"115740052-0-18604","We—I mean, I am … grateful for your assistance. I will see you inside.",""
"115740052-0-18605","Thank you!",""
"115740052-0-18606","You there, halt! There's great danger ahead!",""
"115740052-0-18607","You sent the Guard west? To chase a rumor? We need those troops to protect Shornhelm!",""
"115740052-0-18608","Only some of them, Baron. My father would have done the same. Captain Janeve will discover the truth and report back.",""
"115740052-0-18609","How can we trust you, Count Ravenwatch? Your friendship with Montclair is well known. What did you offer those captains to betray us?",""
"115740052-0-18610","I care for the Count even less than you, Baron, but he hasn't done anything to warrant such accusations—yet.",""
"115740052-0-18611","We must end this debate and take action! Make an example of the two traitors and retake the upper city! How can the two of you not see that?",""
"115740052-0-18612","Mind your tempers, gentlemen. We have a visitor. Come forward, friend, and state your business.",""
"115740052-0-18613","Another outsider. What do you want?",""
"115740052-0-18614","Watch and remember what you're about to see.",""
"115740052-0-18615","First, I'll expose the corruption.",""
"115740052-0-18616","Look. You can see it plainly.",""
"115740052-0-18617","Now to see if I can purge it.",""
"115740052-0-18618","A simple thief of hearts, come to steal yours from this Walking City.",""
"115740052-0-18619","Steal my heart, or still your loins? For your arrow looks aquiver.",""
"115740052-0-18620","Such a lowly mouth can dine anywhere … a trait we both share. What service to our palates should we conjoin in feast!",""
"115740052-0-18622","Foul creature, be gone!",""
"115740052-0-18624","Give me a moment here. It takes a lot of energy to open a portal over this distance.",""
"115740052-0-18625","Well, that didn't go as planned.",""
"115740052-0-18626","That should do it. Enter when ready. We'll be right behind you.",""
"115740052-0-18627","I cannot sleep, and my husband will not wake. What cruel jest is this?",""
"115740052-0-18628","If the Lord of Brutality and Domination is successful, he will merge our world and his own in a terrible Planemeld. Few will survive the ordeal, and those that do will be enslaved for all eternity.",""
"115740052-0-18629","Say the word, Lady <<1>>. I will allow you to sleep in my bed.",""
"115740052-0-18630","Scoundrel! You think to steal me from my husband? From this city I call home?",""
"115740052-0-18631","I only stole your sleep, which I gifted to your husband. His inattention must make him harder to love.",""
"115740052-0-18632","What would you know of love, monster? You have none of it—and you will have none of me!",""
"115740052-0-18633","Your protests ring hollow, Lady <<1>>. We shall see how much when I steal you away from husband and home.",""
"115740052-0-18634","I should never have created this thing in the first place.",""
"115740052-0-18635","Never again!",""
"115740052-0-18636","Thank you. So Peras is alive? We told that idiot not to steer us into Crimson Raider territory.",""
"115740052-0-18637","Ah, I have been looking everywhere for you.",""
"115740052-0-18638","I'll get a weapon and catch up to you and Rahannal!",""
"115740052-0-18639","Did those fools Dorell and Tamrith send you? Let me show you the power I've gained since joining House Montclair!",""
"115740052-0-18640","The plot thickens, does it not?",""
"115740052-0-18641","That … could've gone better ….",""
"115740052-0-18642","I didn't think I had another portal in me … glad I was wrong.",""
"115740052-0-18643","Well … at least some of us survived.",""
"115740052-0-18644","The guards have keys that open these cages. I beg of you, please help!",""
"115740052-0-18645","I prayed that I wouldn't be left to that… that lizard's tortures.",""
"115740052-0-18646","They poked and prodded me. I'm of House Tamrith! How dare they!",""
"115740052-0-18647","I never should have let Peras navigate.",""
"115740052-0-18648","Bless you! Find my friends if you can—if they're still here!",""
"115740052-0-18649","You have quite a figure for a dirty peasant. Can I buy you a drink beautiful?",""
"115740052-0-18650","You're a pig! I wouldn't have a drink with you if you were the last man alive!",""
"115740052-0-18651","What a wonderful spirit you have girl. Normally someone like yourself would be beneath me, but today I feel like taking a chance. What do you say?",""
"115740052-0-18652","It's a rat!",""
"115740052-0-18653","Suddenly I don't feel so well.",""
"115740052-0-18654","Run fast friends! Follow Deepswimmer! And don't drop any poultices!",""
"115740052-0-18655","Murderer…",""
"115740052-0-18656","The guards have the keys. I'm sure my father, the ambassador from Alik'r, will reward you.",""
"115740052-0-18657","You've filled entire graveyards…",""
"115740052-0-18658","Are you going to slaughter the entire town?",""
"115740052-0-18659","I knew Father would send someone for me. He's the ambassador from Alik'r, did I mention that?",""
"115740052-0-18660","Baron Montclair and his Argonian General, Reezal-Jul attacked the nobles of Shornhelm. This is an outrage!",""
"115740052-0-18661","They just won't leave us be. We can't repel them much longer!",""
"115740052-0-18662","They're gone! We can leave.",""
"115740052-0-18663","I should be able to close the portal. It won't take me more than a few seconds.",""
"115740052-0-18664","What happened? No. No! I'm a Goblin!",""
"115740052-0-18665","Not so fast, my friend. You don't have to deal with this on your own.",""
"115740052-0-18666","The herbalists weren't lying, Knight Commander.",""
"115740052-0-18667","I see that my so-called peers have sent underlings to do their dirty work. How typical!",""
"115740052-0-18668","How do you know?",""
"115740052-0-18669","This one saw the Imperials with her own two eyes!",""
"115740052-0-18670","Headed towards the crossing? How many?",""
"115740052-0-18671","This one didn't count them, but there were many.",""
"115740052-0-18672","Time to make our stand then. Tell the other Baandari to be ready.",""
"115740052-0-18673","Saint Pelin's blood! I'm glad you're still here!",""
"115740052-0-18674","Elara! You can't run off this way!",""
"115740052-0-18675","Don't mind me. I'll be quick. Lord Verandis Ravenfeld would be honored by your company.",""
"115740052-0-18676","Well, I must be off. Things to do, people to see. And besides, this place smells like the Montclairs. I don't know how you can stand it.",""
"115740052-0-18677","This Reezal-Jul seized nobles! Such brazen acts must not be tolerated, Baron!",""
"115740052-0-18678","One moment, friend. I may know something about the Fevered Mews.",""
"115740052-0-18679","Indeed. It is time to act, Countess. No more talk. No more debate.",""
"115740052-0-18680","It will be my pleasure! It's time to show those Montclair cowards what it means to betray the people of Rivenspire.",""
"115740052-0-18681","Don't look so shocked, Eselde. It was bound to happen eventually. Our friend will go to the Mews to free the hostages and stop the reinforcements while we assault the upper city. A two-pronged approach.",""
"115740052-0-18682","How can we walk in the Light if we leave innocent townsfolk to languish … wait, are you agreeing with me?",""
"115740052-0-18683","Well, all right then. Baron, if you would. Give the command and rally the Shornhelm Guard.",""
"115740052-0-18684","Isabeth? Is that you already? Thank the Eight!",""
"115740052-0-18685","But sister! You said this was the last time we would help the Sentinel!",""
"115740052-0-18686","Come along, then. We have a sacrifice ready.",""
"115740052-0-18687","When I say, hold the bud out in your hands. Keep them steady, no matter what happens.",""
"115740052-0-18688","Plunge it into the offering. Quickly!",""
"115740052-0-18689","But sister! You said this was the last time we would help the Sentinel!",""
"115740052-0-18690","You failed me, Sai.",""
"115740052-0-18691","Why didn't you protect me?",""
"115740052-0-18692","I should have never trusted you.",""
"115740052-0-18693","We made it.",""
"115740052-0-18694","You'll be remembered as the hero who saved King Emeric! No one will ever know the truth!",""
"115740052-0-18695","Like you, the real Emeric will be dead. I'll destroy the Covenant, and the people will curse both your names!",""
"115740052-0-18696","Quickly! While he's blinded, we must get to the Prophet's Cell!",""
"115740052-0-18697","Come to me, my little snowbird.",""
"115740052-0-18698","Your targets are Captain Siro and the Worm Cultist. Make the first move, and I'll surprise them from behind. Good hunting.",""
"115740052-0-18699","I opened a portal to Oblivion without anyone noticing. You really think you can defeat me?",""
"115740052-0-18700","Father!",""
"115740052-0-18701","Varaine Pellingare will be your opponent! Face me, dog!",""
"115740052-0-18702","Isa—Scout Isabeth, you put this company at risk by disobeying orders.",""
"115740052-0-18703","Thanks to our new ally here, the Wyrd agreed to help us drive out the Reachmen.",""
"115740052-0-18704","I hope you've—Wyress Delphique, what is the meaning of this?",""
"115740052-0-18705","I thought as much. Captain Gaercroft. Your scout is infected.",""
"115740052-0-18706","Kill her if you wish to maintain this alliance.",""
"115740052-0-18707","What are you doing?",""
"115740052-0-18708","I won't kill her based on your word.",""
"115740052-0-18709","Then trust your new ally's word.",""
"115740052-0-18710","I'll make my own judgment! I don't take orders from you.",""
"115740052-0-18711","He's gone! He's gone—but nothing's happening.",""
"115740052-0-18712","Father, stop!",""
"115740052-0-18713","So it's true. I'm infected.",""
"115740052-0-18714","It seems the Mad Architect's destruction did not allow us to step from this plane. Unfortunate, but we'll have to make do. He mastered this place, mastered the Daedra, somehow. Perhaps we can do the same.",""
"115740052-0-18715","But what do we do? Where do we go?",""
"115740052-0-18716","We can't stay here. Not like this.",""
"115740052-0-18717","You've freed them. I've sacrificed much to bring those prisoners here, to keep them … occupied. I won't allow you to compromise that. Your head will make a fitting gift for Molag Bal.",""
"115740052-0-18718","What have you done? Where am I?",""
"115740052-0-18719","This vault? I built it to hold a precious treasure, deep below your Walking City. I will keep you safe, and away from … interference.",""
"115740052-0-18720","I've made my decision, father.",""
"115740052-0-18721","Isabeth, don't be foolish. You can't think straight.",""
"115740052-0-18722","No, father. I've never been so clear.",""
"115740052-0-18723","Wyress Delphique? Do it. Now, before I change my mind!",""
"115740052-0-18724","Isabeth!",""
"115740052-0-18725","Herma-Mora's wagging tongue! The door's warded. We'll never get in this way.",""
"115740052-0-18726","Why have you done this? Is your heart as cold as this chamber?",""
"115740052-0-18727","Your heart is cold, Lady <<1>>. Warming it to <<2>> will unlock the prison built of your denial.",""
"115740052-0-18728","Never! I would rather freeze until time's end than share one warm moment with you!",""
"115740052-0-18729","So be it. This vault shall forever hold your frozen heart! I leave my mantle to conceal the shame you caused me. Farewell, <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-18730","Not the best fit of armor I've had, but it will do.",""
"115740052-0-18731","She's up to something! There's something she's not telling us.",""
"115740052-0-18732","O, I almost forgot about those. Those aren't relics any ways, they aren't causing a problem. You can leave them there.",""
"115740052-0-18733","Nice kill. You interested in hunting something a little more dangerous?",""
"115740052-0-18734","Oh, the stench! Cadwell wasn't joking, was he?",""
"115740052-0-18735","Now join the audience!",""
"115740052-0-18736","You were right, Verandis. I can feel it. The relic is here!",""
"115740052-0-18737","Let's deal with these bothersome creatures and save my dear Leila.",""
"115740052-0-18738","Karnosis, I fear what you are doing. Please, I am so weary.",""
"115740052-0-18739","Come Verandis. We will deal with the creatures. We should hurry.",""
"115740052-0-18740","This tomb was built to hold royal remains, but none remain within.",""
"115740052-0-18741","We cannot slow down! We have too many mouths to feed!",""
"115740052-0-18742","I will tell <<1>>, but he will not take it well.",""
"115740052-0-18743","The Prophet's cage should be just ahead. Quickly, now! We haven't much time.",""
"115740052-0-18744","Ah, Vestige. Welcome.",""
"115740052-0-18745","<<1>> will not listen. He simply cannot afford further losses.",""
"115740052-0-18746","Damn … and Jode's Chariot?",""
"115740052-0-18747","They are open to suggestions, but it may already be too late.",""
"115740052-0-18748","We need a way to win <<1>>'s favor ….",""
"115740052-0-18749","As you will.",""
"115740052-0-18750","Tell <<1>> I have something in mind.",""
"115740052-0-18751","Why do you work against me? Would you have the prince spurn this blessing?",""
"115740052-0-18752","<<1>> is nearby, I'm sure of it!",""
"115740052-0-18753","Over here! Did you find anything that might help us?",""
"115740052-0-18754","You'll never take it from me!",""
"115740052-0-18755","I give myself, that the Prophet might be free!",""
"115740052-0-18756","What life comes to witness my sorrow?",""
"115740052-0-18757","From here on in, things will only become more dangerous.",""
"115740052-0-18758","<Nord goes over the plan while the others chime in periodically. At the end, the player is told to go to the middle of the abandoned settlement to get ready.>",""
"115740052-0-18759","The item we seek is through here. Follow me.",""
"115740052-0-18760","The house forces grow impatient. They refuse to heed my warnings and rush blindly ahead. We may have to strike them down if they do not listen to me.",""
"115740052-0-18761","I've got your back. Focus on finding a way through.",""
"115740052-0-18762","Where did they go? Well, that's never a good sign.",""
"115740052-0-18763","And now you see why Verandis demands obedience. Those soldiers are as good as dead now.",""
"115740052-0-18764","The veil hid this gauntlet of traps from us. We need to move through this area with caution.",""
"115740052-0-18765","And as for you, Suronii: Trying to escape? I'm so dissapointed. After the lovely home I provided for you.",""
"115740052-0-18766","Just kill me and be done with it. I will never stop defying you.",""
"115740052-0-18767","I wonder … is this book real or just another of Lleraya's illusions?",""
"115740052-0-18768","Tempting. But I think you'll be far more entertaining suffering for millennia.",""
"115740052-0-18769","Arrrrrg!",""
"115740052-0-18770","There you are. I hope you didn't have any trouble finding this place.",""
"115740052-0-18771","I think what we're looking for is just beyond this chamber.",""
"115740052-0-18772","What a pleasant sound.",""
"115740052-0-18773","She's waiting.",""
"115740052-0-18774","This is it. The relic is beyond this door!",""
"115740052-0-18775","Here they come! Don't worry! Crazy Eye has your back!",""
"115740052-0-18776","Stand strong, walker! Crazy Eye sees more Imperials coming!",""

"115740052-0-18779","Why not give the Baandari all of our armor too? We'll just defend against the next raid with our fists and good manners!",""
"115740052-0-18780","Why do you fear me, priest? Is it because I can control what you cannot?",""
"115740052-0-18781","Your Highness, I'm sure he means no offense. Please, calm yourself!",""
"115740052-0-18782","As long as he treats me with the respect I deserve … we won't have a problem.",""

"115740052-0-18785","It's all right, Valyrie. I accept it, and you must too. You served me in life and saved me in death. I can be at peace now.",""
"115740052-0-18786","This chill … I remember it. Goodbye Valyrie.",""
"115740052-0-18787","It is done. His body and soul are at rest.",""

"115740052-0-18789","They've gone to see <<1>>. If you hurry, you might catch them.",""
"115740052-0-18790","Ah, you must be one of Verandis' puppets. What do you call yourselves? The Ravenwatch? How … amusing.",""
"115740052-0-18791","Puppet? The only puppet here is you!",""
"115740052-0-18792","Why have you stolen my skull, mortal?",""

"115740052-0-18795","That was hardly a challenge! I can feel the veil shifting. Verandis will bring the troops along now that the shard holder is destroyed.",""
"115740052-0-18796","Your pathetic Aedric trinket can't defeat me! I am Molag Bal, Lord of Domination!",""

"115740052-0-18799","Reachman filth.",""

"115740052-0-18802","Do you have to lumber about like that? Show some …. Show some panache! A little swagger!",""
"115740052-0-18803","Not much gusto. But a smidge of verve, three jots brio … the essentials for a moxie fondue! Mmm, fondue. Hmm? What was I saying?",""
"115740052-0-18804","So, I now have an entire shipment of alchemical apparati covered in bat guano. What am I going to do with that?",""
"115740052-0-18805","You could offload the guano to some of the merchants who travel through Wrothgar. It's … Well, it won't go to waste, I'll say that.",""
"115740052-0-18806","That's fine, I really don't need to hear anything else about that. Just knowing I can send it somewhere is enough.",""
"115740052-0-18807","Verandis wants us to fight together to reach the Doomcrag, yes? This should be most fragrant!",""

"115740052-0-18817","Another one of those damn stones is missing? This one grows tired of these delays.",""
"115740052-0-18818","Meva! Are you all right?",""
"115740052-0-18819","The platform over there. It should be a good spot for the rune.",""
"115740052-0-18820","Wylon, my love, I'm afraid.",""
"115740052-0-18821","You've done it! Excellent work!",""
"115740052-0-18822","Mark my words—this victory will go down in the history books! This is the day the Empire began to crumble!",""
"115740052-0-18823","Your mind is naked to me! I can taste your fear! You are fertile ground for the seeds of eternal torment!",""
"115740052-0-18824","Knights of Saint Pelin! Many of your brothers and sisters died here, but this was the purchase of their sacrifice. Be grateful and be proud!",""
"115740052-0-18825","Tamriel is ripe, and I have all of eternity to reap its harvest of flesh! Death comes for you and all children of the Mundus on black wings!",""

"115740052-0-18829","That was exciting! This one will see you back in Shornhelm!",""
"115740052-0-18831","Didn't expect to see you again.",""
"115740052-0-18832","Give me a moment to open the portal.",""

"115740052-0-18834","You hear that, <<1>>? It's the last of your rebellion, collapsing upon itself.",""
"115740052-0-18835","You have quite a figure for a dirty peasant. Come. Have a drink with me.",""
"115740052-0-18836","You have quite a figure for a dirty peasant. Can I buy you a drink beautiful?",""
"115740052-0-18837","You have quite a figure for a dirty peasant. Can I buy you a drink beautiful?",""

"115740052-0-18851","What do we have here?",""
"115740052-0-18852","So another of you comes seeking Hermaeus Mora, and that is me. Perhaps you will prove greater than Graccus. He holds the Oghma Infinium, where lies the beginning of knowledge. Yours if you slay him. Find the descent to the caves below. He is there.",""
"115740052-0-18853","This is iron ore! I'll get some samples. Go, tell <<1>> that with this ore, we'll have the finest weapons in <<2>>.",""
"115740052-0-18854","We have a better chance of finding them if we split up and search different areas. I'll meet you later.",""
"115740052-0-18855","You must do exactly as I taught you. The power of the Remnant will call to you, tempt you. You must be strong enough to withstand that lure.",""
"115740052-0-18856","I'm ready for this. You know that. Stop treating me like I'm a novice, Verandis.",""
"115740052-0-18857","I won't fail you. I won't let you down.",""
"115740052-0-18858","You have never disappointed me, Gwendis. But the Remnant is more powerful than you can imagine. Be on your guard. Now head inside. I'll join you in a moment.",""
"115740052-0-18859","I should be chosen!",""
"115740052-0-18860","No, I should be chosen.",""
"115740052-0-18861","Stop your quarelling. Ahh, here comes our hero. He can help us solve this problem.",""
"115740052-0-18862","Don't worry, Meva. I'll see you safely away from this place.",""
"115740052-0-18863","I hereby name your house the new royal house of Shornhelm.",""
"115740052-0-18864","You always put yourself last, don't you?",""
"115740052-0-18865","I give you my solemn oath, Your Majesty. I will lead the Kingdom of Shornhelm with wisdom and honor, and I pledge my eternal allegiance to you and to the Daggerfall Covenant.",""
"115740052-0-18866","Nonsense. You and your friend here must destroy the Dark Anchor, or the others died in vain.",""

"115740052-0-18870","No, Shan-ra.",""
"115740052-0-18871","It's going to work, Baron. The power of this ancient Ayleid remnant … it's almost overwhelming.",""
"115740052-0-18872","Tell the queen the truth—her reign will soon end. We are enemies again, you and I.",""
"115740052-0-18873","Wylon! Something feels … wrong ….",""
"115740052-0-18874","Come now, smile! Only good can come of such an auspicious alliance!",""
"115740052-0-18875","It doesn't matter if you think you saw <<1>> eat a potato. I can't do anything without proof.",""
"115740052-0-18876","You are wise to say so, <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-18877","Thank you, treethane. I won't have my good name sullied by this fanatic.",""
"115740052-0-18878","You're going to be all right, Mother. Just hold on.",""
"115740052-0-18879","I can make my way to the shore on my own. No doubt you will cause quite the distraction.",""

"115740052-0-18881","Very well. Let's go.",""
"115740052-0-18882","Enough! I've given my ruling. Now, both of you, please get on with your lives. I don't want to hear any more of this.",""
"115740052-0-18883","Thank you. I will see you again at the chapel in Shornhelm.",""

"115740052-0-18885","Such flattery! Tell me. Why have you called me here?",""
"115740052-0-18886","We have a gift for you, <<1>>. To show our appreciation and solidify our friendship.",""
"115740052-0-18887","Something's … happening. I feel … the power!",""
"115740052-0-18888","Thank you again, friend!",""
"115740052-0-18889","And I believe it has just arrived. My friend, if you would do the honors?",""

"115740052-0-18897","Aveberl, we can't stay here. Everyone seems to think I'm a vampire! It makes me uncomfortable. What if they attack me?",""
"115740052-0-18898","Well, my dear, you are rather pale. And we do tend to favor blacks and reds in our choice of fashion. And then there's the wine ….",""
"115740052-0-18899","You are ignoring my point! Why must you be so … so … indifferent? It makes you impossible to deal with!",""
"115740052-0-18900","No! What … what have you done? This isn't me! I … I never wanted this!",""
"115740052-0-18901","That's the last of them. Now we can take out that Anchor! Let's finish this!",""
"115740052-0-18902","I must send word to the Dominion of what transpired here.",""
"115740052-0-18903","Almalexia sees great things from you, but whether good or bad, I can't say. Thank you for your help.",""
"115740052-0-18904","If we meet again, I hope it is as allies once more. Farewell.",""
"115740052-0-18905","Where are Montclair's forces? I thought for sure we'd have to fight a horde of bloodfiends to make it through this place.",""
"115740052-0-18906","Montclair is a strategist. He's waiting for us to make a mistake that he can take advantage of. I fear that mistake is about to be made.",""

"115740052-0-18908","You should have heeded my warning, Baron. This is no place for you.",""

"115740052-0-18927","Let us continue, Scarlette. Verandis must deal with this on his own.",""
"115740052-0-18928","What? I thought it was bandits that captured us.",""
"115740052-0-18929","Come on fancies, that means you as well. We have business up top.",""
"115740052-0-18930","Karnosis wouldn't let me go. Even after we failed to use the Remnant. He trapped my spirit … held me in his grasp and kept me here. He'll never let me leave here. He knew you'd come back eventually. ""Right your wrongs"" he'd say.",""
"115740052-0-18931","Down the tunnels, in the ruins of the swallowed city: that is where you will find Graccus, and the Oghma Infinium. Prove yourself his better, and take it. He was once a promising subject, but he will never be an Ageless One. Perhaps you will.",""
"115740052-0-18932","He knew me well then. I'm sorry for what happened to you. If I had known back then what I know now - I would have turned you to save you. But I didn't. I gave Karnosis the idea to bring you here. This … was my fault.",""

"115740052-0-18973","You worry too much! You will see, things will be fine soon. Just trust me.",""
"115740052-0-18974","We're going to lay our trap in the abandoned village up the hill. <<1>>, you guard the west gate.",""
"115740052-0-18975","No one's getting by me.",""
"115740052-0-18976","Verandis … something is wrong. You're people … their energy is changing. I'm not sure what's going on. I've never felt this.",""
"115740052-0-18977","The Remnant's power is reaching out. I need to speak to my Ravens, quickly. They've never faced this temptation before.",""
"115740052-0-18978","May the Divines guide my bow.",""
"115740052-0-18979","<<1>>, you're on the ridge by the east gate.",""
"115740052-0-18980","Strange, wait! There is something I wish to speak with you about before you continue.",""
"115740052-0-18981","I'll take the north. Our new friend will use the bloodstone to lay the bait in the well at the center of town.",""
"115740052-0-18982","I love this part.",""
"115740052-0-18983","Drop the bloodstone into the well. Blood will spout forth, and it'll draw the vampires out of hiding. We'll be waiting to cut them down.",""
"115740052-0-18984","Don't joke, lest the Divines punish your frivolity.",""
"115740052-0-18985","The vampire lord won't sit by while we thin his flock. If you see him, whistle.",""
"115740052-0-18986","If everyone's ready, let's get into position.",""
"115740052-0-18987","Listen closely. This is the plan.",""
"115740052-0-18988","You remember those bandits? The ones in the fort?",""
"115740052-0-18989","Someone came through and rousted them out. Returned the artifacts to the Arkay clergy.",""
"115740052-0-18990","Impressive, I guess. I think I could have done it! If I wasn't so busy.",""
"115740052-0-18991","The Colovians were thrown out of Arenthia! Your wife's sister still hanging around the house?",""
"115740052-0-18992","What's that supposed to mean?",""
"115740052-0-18993","The Colovians weren't High Elves, though. What would the Arenthian Resistance have against your wife's sister?",""
"115740052-0-18994","She's still here, yes. She isn't sure it's safe for her to show her face up there.",""
"115740052-0-18995","Oh you know how your people get, Aru. Once their blood is up, it's hard to back down again.",""
"115740052-0-18996","Calm down, I didn't mean anything by it. Besides, I think she's just trying to get in another meal before she leaves.",""
"115740052-0-18997","Did you hear those Colovian dogs were dumb enough to go after Vinedusk?",""
"115740052-0-18998","It's the truth! Heard it from my cousin. I bet they have to build more carts just to carry all the bodies back to Colovia.",""
"115740052-0-18999","Baan Dar's leg, you've got to be joking.  No one would take on the Rangers in their own camp.",""
"115740052-0-19000","I say they deserve it. I hope the Rangers rip them apart like a Senche with a steak.",""
"115740052-0-19001","So my cousin that trades at Vinedusk Village said the Colovians were defeated.",""
"115740052-0-19002","She says it's a charnel house. The Rangers burned down half their encampment to drive out the Collies!",""
"115740052-0-19003","Hah! Excellent, tell me the gory details.",""
"115740052-0-19004","Delicious! This one hopes the Rangers sent them straight into Molag Bal's torture pits.",""
"115740052-0-19005","I'm telling you, the Champion down at Thizzrini Arena is unbeatable.",""
"115740052-0-19006","Did you hear what those crazy Wood Elves got up to in Willowgrove?",""
"115740052-0-19007","You know their ridiculous ""Green Pact?"" Well, they can't clear the forest on their own. So they hired a Mage from the guild to clear it for them. I hear he's a washout from Telenger's research crew!",""
"115740052-0-19008","This should be good. No, what did they do?",""
"115740052-0-19009","Oh, those wacky Bosmer! What will they get up to next?",""
"115740052-0-19010","Did you hear what happened with those Wood Elves in Willowgrove? Those silly Bosmer with the Mage?",""
"115740052-0-19011","Oh, no, nothing so droll. Some travelering do-gooder came through and saved them from themselves. Apparently he'd managed to summon up a forest full of Atronachs!",""
"115740052-0-19012","No! You never told me what happened. Did that failure of a Mage burn the forest to the ground?",""
"115740052-0-19013","That Ishalga is a sure bet! She's taken every challenger, she even took apart an Orc!",""
"115740052-0-19014","Get down there and make a bet quick as you can. The bet-takers are going to stop offering good odds.",""
"115740052-0-19015","Did I tell you that Ishalga was unseated? Dead on the ground in the Thizzrini Arena.",""
"115740052-0-19016","Some dark horse tore up through the divisions and went straight at her throat.",""
"115740052-0-19017","Do you have any idea how many coins I lost in that wager? Pah. Damned show stopper.",""
"115740052-0-19018","Don't eat me! Wait. You're not a spider. I'm saved! Oh thank you!",""
"115740052-0-19019","Hah! When will those backwoods creatures learn to leave magic to their betters?",""
"115740052-0-19020","Calden Malhaven may know a shortcut to the Mews. We were childhood friends, and he knows the city like the back of his hand.",""
"115740052-0-19021","You'll need a key to set me free. I'm sure the guards are carrying them.",""
"115740052-0-19022","That horrible Argonian, Reezal-Jul, said he would turn me into a powerful creature. Why would I want that?",""
"115740052-0-19023","Ah, sweet freedom! Thank you so much for coming to my rescue.",""
"115740052-0-19024","Look at them, Verandis! Look at them! Your pupils are embracing the power of the Remnant. They feed upon these mortals that you'd be so foolish to bring here.",""
"115740052-0-19025","This ends now, Karnosis. I will stop you!",""
"115740052-0-19026","Stop those two. They don't have control of themselves. I'll deal with Karnosis.",""
"115740052-0-19027","Yes, come and … deal with us. I had always wondered what you would taste like.",""
"115740052-0-19028","What … what am I doing? Stop! Please!",""
"115740052-0-19029","This one is confused … what is going on?",""
"115740052-0-19030","What have you done to them? What have you done?",""
"115740052-0-19031","She's breathing still. Barely. Zeli we need to get them out of here and back to camp.",""
"115740052-0-19032","What tantalizing work! Come to me, mortal. I would have words with you.",""
"115740052-0-19033","Not until this evil is purged. They did this to them! Their leader will do the same to us. We have to stop them Darien.",""
"115740052-0-19034","Save it for another time, Zeli! She is defeated and Estre is wounded. We have to get them back!",""
"115740052-0-19035","No. The gods will that this evil be purged. We rid ourselves of them and then we continue our purge by destroyed Verandis. If Estre dies, it is because the gods will it.",""
"115740052-0-19036","Your gods, not mine. No one dies that doesn't have to. Not unless they have to, and let me tell you Zeli, you're making me feel like you're going to have to if you don't stop this. Now.",""
"115740052-0-19037","Enough of this! You and your Ravenwatch ally there will only stand in the way of what the gods tell me! No more of this! You will all die!",""
"115740052-0-19038","So much for your light protecting you now. Crazy fanatic.",""
"115740052-0-19039","You need to get up there and stop those vampires from doing whatever they're going to do. I'll get everyone out of here. Somehow. Even our Raven friends.",""
"115740052-0-19040","I thought I was food for sure. Thank you! We should get out of here while we can!",""
"115740052-0-19041","Whoever kills the fewest bloodsuckers buys the drinks!",""
"115740052-0-19042","Keep pushing! Drive the bastards back or put them down!",""
"115740052-0-19043","The prince has risen! It's a miracle!",""
"115740052-0-19044","Smoke? What's going on?",""
"115740052-0-19045","What are you doing? Are you mad?",""
"115740052-0-19046","What are you doing?",""
"115740052-0-19047","What does it look like? I'm clearing away some rubbish.",""
"115740052-0-19048","By burning down the embassy?",""
"115740052-0-19049","I'm watching the fire! I won't let it get out of control.",""
"115740052-0-19050","Unless you want the ambassador to hear about this, you'll put it out at once!",""
"115740052-0-19051","I am pleased that the Montclair situation has been dealt with. But I find the rest of the news coming out of Rivenspire to be gravely disturbing.",""
"115740052-0-19052","I'm not sure we should put much stock in rumors, Your Highness. This man, Ravenfeld, however, claims to have information.",""
"115740052-0-19053","What brings you to Sancre Tor, old friends? Looking for an amulet, perhaps?",""
"115740052-0-19054","I tried to warn Shornhelm's noble houses. My Ravenwatch has been waiting for this blight to emerge from the Doomcrag, and now it is upon us.",""
"115740052-0-19055","Fool! When I ascended, you could have been at my right hand, Tharn. Instead you chose to align yourself with mongrels and imbeciles. Now you'll die with them!",""
"115740052-0-19056","Now, back to my mind-numbing duties. Good luck out there.",""
"115740052-0-19057","You have my thanks, friend.",""
"115740052-0-19058","Are you done yet?",""
"115740052-0-19059","Ah, Sai. You still don't understand, do you? My plan will succeed because of your ward of Stendarr! It will prevent Molag Bal from observing or interfering. By the time the ward is down and the amulet is mine, it will already be too late!",""
"115740052-0-19060","Not if we stop you!",""
"115740052-0-19061","Naive child! You know nothing! Chim-el Adabal, the red diamond at the center of the Amulet of Kings, is the most powerful Soul Gem ever created!",""
"115740052-0-19062","Look out! They're coming from the stables!",""
"115740052-0-19063","I think I hear something in the old smithy. Stay sharp!",""
"115740052-0-19064","I could kill these things all day.",""
"115740052-0-19065","They are swarming out of the longhouse! Stand firm!",""
"115740052-0-19066","That's the last of them. Good work.",""
"115740052-0-19067","The Ravenwatch is prepared to aid you in any way that we can—provided you are willing to do exactly as I say.",""
"115740052-0-19068","I want to hear more of this, Ravenfeld. But first, I must speak to our new arrival. Come here, my friend.",""
"115740052-0-19069","Damn the Mad God! Why can't I make sense of this text! I'm such an idiot!",""
"115740052-0-19070","I see my Blacksap are no match for you.",""
"115740052-0-19071","Sheogorath! You bastard, the Folium Discognitum wasn't worth an island! I'll get Eyevea back, even if it takes three lifetimes!",""
"115740052-0-19072","To identify me as your prisoner, so the Vinedusk don't kill me on sight? Very well.",""
"115740052-0-19073","I'm ready to go when you are.",""
"115740052-0-19074","<<1>>, I did it! I have created a sanctuary, a retreat that will endure for eons! I shall call it … Eyevea!",""
"115740052-0-19075","The king's champion is coming, Magus-General. Should we make an example of this fool?",""
"115740052-0-19076","Blasphemy! How dare you raise the honored dead to fight your battle!",""
"115740052-0-19077","It's not ""we"", Papus. It's ""you"". I have other matters to attend to. Finish the ceremony first, then deal with the interloper.",""
"115740052-0-19078","Yes, of course. The dark anchors first, then the … interloper. Thank you for this honor, Magus-General. Glory to the Empire!",""
"115740052-0-19079","Glory to the Lord of Brutality, Papus. Glory to Molag Bal.",""
"115740052-0-19080","Please, let me go!",""
"115740052-0-19081","Thank Y'frre, you're not with them!",""
"115740052-0-19082","Thank you! I'm getting out of here!",""
"115740052-0-19083","I hope you are happy. This is a dark day for us all.",""
"115740052-0-19084","Bored! Here, I brought you some presents. The spiky ones are the best, wouldn't you say?",""
"115740052-0-19085","How … unexpected.",""
"115740052-0-19086","Now! Pull him through!",""
"115740052-0-19087","Stibbons! You're your old self again!",""
"115740052-0-19088","What a hodgepodge! How is one supposed to find anything in here?",""
"115740052-0-19089","Ah yes, now I recall how it was!",""
"115740052-0-19090","I'll have this in an instant ….",""
"115740052-0-19091","This is a curious one! I must have missed it on my first pass.",""
"115740052-0-19092","These writings are very old indeed. How gratifying!",""
"115740052-0-19093","The tongue! Of course!",""
"115740052-0-19094","Ugh, how very disgusting!",""
"115740052-0-19095","That blowhard Dorell sent you, didn't he? Or was it sweet Tamrith? No matter. Whoever it was, they sent you to die!",""
"115740052-0-19096","Mother was our rock. I loved her so much.",""
"115740052-0-19097","I do not like Mannimarco as a mortal. I think I will like him even less as a god.",""
"115740052-0-19098","Now, if my calculations are correct ….",""
"115740052-0-19099","This should take effect almost immediately.",""
"115740052-0-19100","Father was strong, steady. He held our family together.",""
"115740052-0-19101","I miss you, Marrec. You were a spoiled brat, but I loved you.",""
"115740052-0-19102","Rest in peace, honored dead.",""
"115740052-0-19103","Blessed Arkay, please sanctify our family and the ground they rest in. Let them find peace and keep them safe.",""
"115740052-0-19104","Is nothing sacred to that worm?",""
"115740052-0-19105","The next time you hide something from the most powerful necromancer in all of Tamriel, you might reconsider hiding it in a bloody tomb!",""
"115740052-0-19106","I swear on the souls of my ancesters, I will avenge Mannimarco's blasphemy!",""
"115740052-0-19107","I am ever grateful.",""
"115740052-0-19108","Sai, look out! He's raising Ra Abah!",""
"115740052-0-19109","Hold the line! They must not get the ring!",""
"115740052-0-19110","Oh no, not <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-19111","There you are! I've been looking all over Shornhelm for you.",""
"115740052-0-19112","Life gets no better than this! No wind, no rain, and plenty of … entertainment.",""
"115740052-0-19113","It's just as I expected. Lleraya knew I'd come here and has placed an obstacle in our way.",""
"115740052-0-19114","Your words are wise, <<1>>. Now, come … sit by me and enjoy what we have to offer.",""
"115740052-0-19115","Follow me! Out the back!",""
"115740052-0-19116","I followed the vampire lord right to his lair. It's in the cave, north of town.",""
"115740052-0-19117","Ah, you tempt me, but this one's husband is waiting.",""
"115740052-0-19118","Hurry, use the runestone!",""
"115740052-0-19119","But you have no husband here, my lord. My friends and I will see you forget your troubles.",""
"115740052-0-19120","Guards, stand down! If the intruder made it here, you'll just be another notch on the scabbard.",""
"115740052-0-19121","Soon, you will know the extent of my power and bow before me!",""
"115740052-0-19122","All the nations of Tamriel will bow before me! They will worship me and beg for my mercy! All will know the name of Mannimarco as their one, true god!",""
"115740052-0-19123","Looks like you might have a chance to use the <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-19124","And here we are! Quick, let's find that relic and finish this.",""
"115740052-0-19125","Come to me, spirits of the tortured. We have work to do to prepare for Nerien'eth's return!",""
"115740052-0-19126","Quick, follow him. Slay the vampire lord. For Agalir!",""
"115740052-0-19127","Mongrel filth! I should have known you'd be trouble!",""
"115740052-0-19128","You'll have to build that embassy over my dead body!",""
"115740052-0-19129","This way! The relic has to be close.",""
"115740052-0-19130","Well done! Let's get back to Elden Tree!",""
"115740052-0-19131","You're right! You're absolutely right! I pushed everyone away, and then hated them for leaving me behind! Thank you for helping me realize I'm the source of my own problems!",""
"115740052-0-19132","All right, lead me to my father.",""
"115740052-0-19133","Stibbons, take a drink from that cup. I want to see what happens.",""
"115740052-0-19134","You there. We need to talk.",""
"115740052-0-19135","You'll never make a living reading all day. You need to earn some coin, Valaste!",""
"115740052-0-19136","Even Mages take their noses out of their books once in a while. You just can't stand to be around people! Pathetic.",""
"115740052-0-19137","The world is a cruel place, my assistants. Mages are envied their power, and reviled for using it. We must have place where we can study in seclusion. A place where all Mages can be safe.",""
"115740052-0-19138","It's working, comrade. I can see the living past of this ruin through your eyes. Now let's move.",""
"115740052-0-19139","That was <<1>>, scion of evil King Anumaril. He must have been left behind to defend the Vivicus.",""
"115740052-0-19140","A shrine to the Prince of Lies. My stomache turns just to see it. Let's move on.",""
"115740052-0-19141","Hold a moment! I must speak with you.",""
"115740052-0-19142","A trick!",""
"115740052-0-19143","By the light, that must be the <<1>>!",""
"115740052-0-19144","My sister and I are going to bury our family. We'd be honored if you accompanied us.",""
"115740052-0-19145","What's this?",""
"115740052-0-19146","Marrec would come here to play all the time. It made Mother so nervous. She hated these ruins.",""
"115740052-0-19147","I remember Father's ghost stories. He tried to scare us into staying away. But the stories just made Marrec more interested.",""
"115740052-0-19148","Things are going to be so different now that they're gone.",""
"115740052-0-19149","Thank you for coming with us. I feel safer with you nearby.",""
"115740052-0-19150","Wandering into a crypt when a necromancer is about? Your curiosity will be your undoing. Rise up, fallen heroes! Kill the intruders!",""
"115740052-0-19151","Impressive. But allow me to raise an enemy that will offer a bit more of a challenge!",""
"115740052-0-19152","Can you believe it? The officers won't tell us a thing. We're not even allowed in the city!",""
"115740052-0-19153","If you have a problem, go talk to Captain Khala. I saw her giving that new transfer a piece of her mind.",""
"115740052-0-19154","I saw that. She dragged the poor guy into the officers' quarters and I haven't seen either of them since.",""
"115740052-0-19155","There you are! Come on, we need to take out that vampire lord! <<1>> is probably waiting for us!",""
"115740052-0-19156","I will light your way home …",""
"115740052-0-19157","This academy isn't accepting new students, mortal. Be gone.",""
"115740052-0-19158","The ritual you will undergo is as old and ancient as the stars.",""
"115740052-0-19159","The Father of Manbeasts demands tribute, as do I. I am his Packmaster.",""
"115740052-0-19160","Kneel at the altar of our master. Listen to his words.",""

"115740052-0-19163","Heed me, pup. You stand now in my hunting ground.",""
"115740052-0-19164","My, my, Sir Darien. That was impressive. But when it comes to smuggler's tunnels, I think there's a thing or two I can teach you.",""
"115740052-0-19165","You desire power, but have you the will?",""
"115740052-0-19166","The God of Schemes has tasted your soul. You've come back tainted. Wrong.","Il Dio degli Intrighi ha assaggiato la tua anima. Sei tornato contaminato. Non va bene."
"115740052-0-19167","Hunt. Seek a tribute worthy of your pack. Bring it down, then howl for your brothers and sisters.",""
"115740052-0-19168","I'm not sure how to respond to that. Why don't you find out what our vampire vixen is talking about.",""
"115740052-0-19169","If the pack accepts you, they will feed, and you will join them. Now, experience my power!",""
"115740052-0-19170","The mad king has fallen! Come, we need to talk.",""
"115740052-0-19171","Wow, a real vampire!",""
"115740052-0-19172","I assume I should stop worrying about an ambush.",""
"115740052-0-19173","The sooner you begin, the sooner this is over.",""
"115740052-0-19174","What am I going to do? I can't do what they … who's there?",""
"115740052-0-19175","Valaste … sorry dear. Say goodbye to the little dreamlings!",""
"115740052-0-19176","If they want me to do the impossible, they could at least let me unpack first!",""
"115740052-0-19177","The Blacksap are finished! We're at the west bridge. Come, join us!",""
"115740052-0-19178","No need to shout, <<1>>!",""
"115740052-0-19179","So Hircine has sent you to his hunting ground.",""
"115740052-0-19180","Yes, ma'am!",""
"115740052-0-19181","Our hero returns! <<1>>, open a portal. <<2>> wants to speak with our friend.",""
"115740052-0-19182","If I am to die at your hands, I shall ensure you die by mine.",""
"115740052-0-19183","I'll show Hircine who the better hunter is!",""
"115740052-0-19184","I'll take your heart as a prize!",""
"115740052-0-19185","What a magnificent structure! The relic this monolith houses must be powerful indeed!",""
"115740052-0-19186","Not much farther, Leila. Your pain will soon be over.",""
"115740052-0-19187","Too many thefts, <<1>>! <<2>> has threatened to call in the Thalmor!",""
"115740052-0-19188","Keep me informed.",""
"115740052-0-19189","I'll meet you in the main room!",""
"115740052-0-19190","Enough! The pup has become a wolf.",""
"115740052-0-19191","Bow to me, hunter, and receive true power.",""
"115740052-0-19192","Go. Bow to the master.",""
"115740052-0-19193","Sai, it's me! We're seeing some kind of vision of you. Do you know where you are?",""
"115740052-0-19194","I … I don't know. They're torturing me. They … want the Amulet of Kings. Want me to tell them where it's hidden. But I haven't broken. Not yet.",""
"115740052-0-19195","We'll find you! Somehow, we'll get you out of there! Sai? Sai! No! Bring him back, you bastards!",""
"115740052-0-19196","My son, you must ensure I am not disturbed. Maintaining the final phase of the Mortuum Vivicus requires all of my concentration!",""
"115740052-0-19197","A fine kill, my friend. I accept your tribute.",""
"115740052-0-19198","Join me! Feast!",""
"115740052-0-19199","By the mace of the master!",""
"115740052-0-19200","Fool! You cannot stop the Mortuum Vivicus!",""
"115740052-0-19201","Come out of there! I saw you go down there! Get off my ship before I gut you!",""
"115740052-0-19202","Come here, Adept. I have something for you.",""
"115740052-0-19203","How dare you interrupt me?",""
"115740052-0-19204","The tunnel is inside the cove beneath the lighthouse. That key will unlock the trapdoor.",""
"115740052-0-19205","Hey, get back over here!",""
"115740052-0-19206","<<1>>, stop your relentless pacing! It's giving me a headache.",""
"115740052-0-19207","Bite your tongue, <<1>>. Your lack of commitment is the reason we're here.",""
"115740052-0-19208","Halls of the gods or halls of the dead? Which is it? Is there a difference?",""
"115740052-0-19209","My death means nothing! The master will still destroy you!",""
"115740052-0-19210","If you won't stop bickering, I'll gag you both.",""
"115740052-0-19211","No! My sacred charge! Your life for the master!",""
"115740052-0-19212","Ah, come in! Good work out there.",""
"115740052-0-19213","Over here! By the rocks!",""
"115740052-0-19214","Come on. I'll take you to where the others are waiting.",""
"115740052-0-19215","Arkay the Forsaker, we curse you. You left us to suffer in darkness.",""
"115740052-0-19216","But we survived. And in darkness we grew.",""
"115740052-0-19217","I cannot leave without  <<1>>. Look for me at the central cavern.",""
"115740052-0-19218","Now, we feed upon your followers. We will use their stolen strength to conquer and consume you.",""
"115740052-0-19219","I told you I would break through the ward. And now, I will break you.",""
"115740052-0-19220","Molag Bal, Father of Torment, we curse you. You sought to poison us with your blood.",""
"115740052-0-19221","But we survived. And from your poison, we grew.",""
"115740052-0-19222","King of Corruption, your children are coming. They will defile and destroy you.",""
"115740052-0-19223","I'm not leaving. If I wanted to leave, I would have already done so.",""
"115740052-0-19224","Listen up, you bunch of corset-wearing dog-diddlers! We got a new piece of meat on the rack, fresh out of the bowels of Spindleclutch!",""
"115740052-0-19225","What do you say we show 'em a proper welcome to the club?",""
"115740052-0-19226","Hear, hear! I've got a proper welcome for 'em—right down in my breeches!",""
"115740052-0-19227","Tell us you found something, hero. We could use some good news.",""
"115740052-0-19228","Might be that's a monster they could actually slay, eh Jalid?",""
"115740052-0-19229","I'm not interested in news. Just tell me you found a way to get us into those tunnels.",""
"115740052-0-19230","Always with the breeches. You lot should get out more. Besides, that's no proper welcome. I propose a toast!",""
"115740052-0-19231","Hear, hear! A toast!",""
"115740052-0-19232","A toast and a song!",""
"115740052-0-19233","Hear, hear!",""
"115740052-0-19234","To the new meat's mother. May she have many healthy children—since this one's a goner!",""
"115740052-0-19235","Ha ha!",""
"115740052-0-19236","To the new meat's lover. May their tears be few and silent—so I don't have to hear it when this one dies!",""
"115740052-0-19237","To the new meat's face! May it always bear a smile—so it doesn't look so ugly mounted on a pike!",""
"115740052-0-19238","A fine toast, for a fine piece of meat. Now let's have a song to finish them off!",""
"115740052-0-19239","Who knows no fear … of beast or blade?",""
"115740052-0-19240","Undaunted! Undaunted!",""
"115740052-0-19241","Look! The Amulet! I can see it from here!",""
"115740052-0-19242","Who knows no fear … of Daedric planes?",""
"115740052-0-19243","We are Undaunted!",""
"115740052-0-19244","Who knows no fear … of death? Of age?",""
"115740052-0-19245","Undaunted! Undaunted! We are Undaunted!",""
"115740052-0-19246","I need to let Verandis know what's going on. In the meantime, talk to Skordo. He knows the city like the back of his hand.",""
"115740052-0-19247","Hold on. I'm coming with you.",""
"115740052-0-19248","Let's check the buildings. There has to be one we can use as a safe location.",""
"115740052-0-19249","Children, this is your kin. Life still flows within its blood.",""
"115740052-0-19250","Tear it out. Drain it, so that it may join us.",""
"115740052-0-19251","Now, you are one of us.",""
"115740052-0-19252","I offer you a gift. The catacombs are filled with the Defiler's cultists. Fresh blood.",""
"115740052-0-19253","Sneak up behind your prey and feast. Relish your new powers. Embrace my blessing.",""
"115740052-0-19254","We shine in darkness. We draw life from life.",""
"115740052-0-19255","A new face! What's your business?",""
"115740052-0-19256","You blind fools! You can't see the good Lleraya can do with this power. She'll bring a new order to this miserable world!",""
"115740052-0-19257","Where is it? It's supposed to be here! Why isn't it here?",""
"115740052-0-19258","Bless you! Bless you!",""
"115740052-0-19259","Innkeep Balik lived here. I hope he isn't one of these bloodfiends. Anyway, this place is too small for our needs. Let's keep looking.",""
"115740052-0-19260","There's little anyone can do for us.",""
"115740052-0-19261","These old eyes see you! Come, come!",""
"115740052-0-19262","This is the proudest day of my life, Guildmaster. Thank you.",""
"115740052-0-19263","Take care, my friend. The spell key is going to become unstable. The effects may be … explosive.",""
"115740052-0-19264","Are you here to help me? Please hurry!",""
"115740052-0-19265","This should do nicely. Let's make sure it's clear.",""
"115740052-0-19266","With the disguise, the soldiers won't give you a second glance. But the sentries will certainly stop you if they can.",""
"115740052-0-19267","That should do it. We can enter the ruins now.",""
"115740052-0-19268","Ellic, where can you be?",""
"115740052-0-19269","Hah, take that! Uh … hmm. Something appears to have broke.",""
"115740052-0-19270","Oh, there you are. Have you found anything yet?",""
"115740052-0-19271","Try not to let the bloodfiends suffer when you kill them. They were the citizens of Northpoint once.",""
"115740052-0-19272","Gather the others and let's meet at the manor. We have plans to make and I fear our time grows short, the Light preserve us.",""
"115740052-0-19273","Have at thee, foul creatures!",""
"115740052-0-19274","Well, that's never happened before. Look out! Behind you!",""
"115740052-0-19275","Finally, the last phrase … hee. The little word buggies go crawling around the page! Squirm, squirm, squirm little buggies!",""
"115740052-0-19276","Damn the Mad God. Damn Ulfsild! Damn the lot of them!",""
"115740052-0-19277","They'll see … they'll all see. Archmage Shalidor's name will ring across history!",""
"115740052-0-19278","Watch out, they're coming out of the woodwork!",""
"115740052-0-19279","I lost track of the Baron and the Countess when I heard the innkeeper scream. But I was too late.",""
"115740052-0-19280","He gave me the key to the inn before he died. I think he tried to tell me something, but I couldn't make it out. Be on your guard. Here comes more of those monsters.",""
"115740052-0-19281","Thanks for rescuing me. Just so you know, this isn't a usual occurrence. Oh, who am I kidding? This happens to me all the time.",""
"115740052-0-19282","Can I assume the house you emerged from is our safe location? Of course it is. I'll just wander over and have a little lie down, if it's all the same with you.",""
"115740052-0-19283","Damn it, Countess! That stings! Stop smearing me with your religious ointments and creams!",""
"115740052-0-19284","Lleraya has been here all along? And your son didn't do a damn thing about it?",""
"115740052-0-19285","According to Ellic's journal, yes. He seems to have been infatuated with the woman. Didn't even get alarmed when she started turning people into bloodfiends.",""
"115740052-0-19286","Gah! What is that stuff? It smells like church! Keep it away from me!",""
"115740052-0-19287","More bloodfiends? I hate this. Just give me something to hit already! But it does sound like your son betrayed Northpoint, Baron.",""
"115740052-0-19288","It's the Remnant. It put Ellic under her spell. I'm surprised he was even able to write in his journal. Maybe that was his way of warning us.",""
"115740052-0-19289","I'm going with you to check on the inn. Skordo, when we give the signal, call in the army.",""
"115740052-0-19290","Head to the inn. I'm right behind you.",""
"115740052-0-19291","My people … a ruler shouldn't have to cut down his own people like this ….",""
"115740052-0-19292","Commander Attius is down the hall. He tortured us. He needs to pay.",""
"115740052-0-19293","One favor I ask: if you see Commander Attius, kill him.",""
"115740052-0-19294","The garrison is ours! You imbeciles will soon witness the Empire's true strength!",""
"115740052-0-19295","Comrade, over here!",""
"115740052-0-19296","Let's check upstairs. Someone must have survived this nightmare.",""
"115740052-0-19297","Worm! You accomplish nothing. I remove the Vivicus to Coldharbour. This doom will come again to Tamriel.",""
"115740052-0-19298","It's good to see you're still alive, my old friend!",""
"115740052-0-19299","It's up to you, <<1>>. You bear the Prismatic Weapon, and the hopes of everyone in Delodiil.",""
"115740052-0-19300","In fact, let's sweeten the deal. You decide she stays, I'll cure her! That's right! Uncle Sheo will make her sane again. Boring old Valaste, whose only friends are books!",""
"115740052-0-19301","Now that I know my people are safe and hidden, it is time to order the army to attack. Stop Lleraya if you can, but save my son. I want him alive to answer for his crimes.",""
"115740052-0-19302","And if the adept decides she goes with you?",""
"115740052-0-19303","Stop following me.",""
"115740052-0-19304","Well, as it happens I have one more book here. I'd give it to you in exchange for Valaste. It's called … the Folium Discognitum.",""
"115740052-0-19305","Wrote it myself, it's a delightful little artifact. It imbues the reader with the knowledge of madmen! It's very powerful … worth oh, four or five of those Skyshard things you adventurers are always looking for.",""
"115740052-0-19306","So! Valaste stays and I cure her. Or … she goes with me and you, my little mortal, become much more powerful. Your choice!",""
"115740052-0-19307","Sheogorath, you bastard! You'd throw the Folium back in my face, after all these years?",""
"115740052-0-19308","An intruder? So you're the one who's been undoing our work. We will feed you to the Master's Mace.",""
"115740052-0-19309","Excellent! The Mantle was the key. Come back here, now!",""
"115740052-0-19310","Here we go!",""
"115740052-0-19311","Look! It's working! I can't believe it!",""
"115740052-0-19312","Ayrenn, there's always time to protect you from yourself.",""
"115740052-0-19313","When you wear <<1>>, you'll never be held in place!",""
"115740052-0-19314","A trophy catch. I'll enjoy gutting you!",""
"115740052-0-19315","Who dares interfere with my hunt?",""
"115740052-0-19316","What's this? A worthy speciman for my collection.",""
"115740052-0-19317","Ah, all the nobles have gathered! What an excellent party!",""
"115740052-0-19318","Someone new? How exciting! Come up, come up! You must introduce yourself before you can join the festivities.",""
"115740052-0-19319","Another head for Hircine.",""
"115740052-0-19320","No, I'm saying you can't really know how we feel. Your home was never invaded.",""
"115740052-0-19321","And I'm saying the Dunmer have been enslaving my people for centuries. How does that make me unequipped to understand you?",""
"115740052-0-19322","It's not even the same! It's completely different, how do you not see that?",""
"115740052-0-19323","The Prince of Madness doesn't stay where he's not wanted … heh, except when he does. But in this case, he doesn't! Until next time, Magelings!",""
"115740052-0-19324","No! You tricked me, sister! It's your fault!",""
"115740052-0-19325","Brother! No!",""
"115740052-0-19326","Friends, fellow nobles, the glorious blessing of Lady Lleraya is almost upon us! Let us prepare ourselves to bask in her presence.",""
"115740052-0-19327","Hold still just a moment, comrade.",""
"115740052-0-19328","You might as well come up. I know that you're here.",""
"115740052-0-19329","I can take your pain away. I can make you feel so much better.",""
"115740052-0-19330","Well, well, well. You're not at all what I was expecting. That makes this so much more exciting.",""
"115740052-0-19331","You need to resist her, my friend.",""
"115740052-0-19332","I must not delay.",""
"115740052-0-19333","You must break free of her spell before all is lost!",""
"115740052-0-19334","Just as in Lorkrata, Lleraya has cast a veil. It hides her. Protects her. You must find a way to enter the illusion. The basement! I can feel slight imperfections in the spell down there.",""
"115740052-0-19335","There I am … still dead. So do I just climb back in …?",""
"115740052-0-19336","There. Easier than I thought. That knife wound still smarts, but it's good to be alive.",""
"115740052-0-19337","You there! Stranger! Why are you here?",""
"115740052-0-19338","All right everyone. This is it. No one is allowed to die until they've taken down at least a dozen enemies. Kill as many as you can. The only exception is the Magus-General—she's mine, and mine alone.",""
"115740052-0-19339","Good speech, Emeric. I can't believe you still fancy me after all these years. Let's get reacquainted then, shall we?",""
"115740052-0-19340","To arms! Defend the King!",""
"115740052-0-19341","You will not!",""
"115740052-0-19342","Overconfident as ever, I see! I'm not afraid of you, Septima ….",""
"115740052-0-19343","I think we need to spend some alone time, Emeric. Come, let's find a quiet place ….",""
"115740052-0-19344","<<1>> and <<2>> will hold the door from this side. Valasha and I from the other. May the Sunburst guide your sword-arm, my friend.",""
"115740052-0-19345","Vermin, all of you! I'll kill you all!",""
"115740052-0-19346","Welcome, my pets! Soon I shall bestow upon you my blessing. Then you will be able to truly take your place by my side.",""
"115740052-0-19347","I ask only one small, insignificant thing from you. One tiny favor. You must all give yourselves—totally and completely—to me.",""
"115740052-0-19348","Northpoint has given so much to me already. So many devoted worshippers. So much blood. Soon, all of Rivenspire will do the same. And then all the lands beyond!",""
"115740052-0-19349","The veil is a powerful illusion. But just as at Lorkrata, you can manipulate its power using a tear. You have entered the veil. Now find Lleraya and finish this.",""
"115740052-0-19350","As usual, Verandis once again ruins my fun. I guess I'll just have to destroy you now. Pity, but I can always get another pet.",""
"115740052-0-19351","Poor Lleraya. I never wanted it to come to this.",""
"115740052-0-19352","foo",""
"115740052-0-19353","zod",""
"115740052-0-19354","What do you think you're doing?",""
"115740052-0-19355","Welcome to the fight, comrade. Claws out!",""
"115740052-0-19356","Where is the guard? And what are you doing here?",""
"115740052-0-19357","I will take that as a compliment, Rulanir. But look around. Look what he helped me to build. The Agea Relle and its students are more beautiful than I ever dreamed. How can you doubt his character?",""
"115740052-0-19358","That is not a reason to love someone.",""
"115740052-0-19359","He was my husband before we built the school, Rulanir. And it's not like you haven't gained from his work. Being our blademaster is the first steady job you've held since the Fighters Guild kicked you out.",""
"115740052-0-19360","I'll be back on the roads of Tamriel soon enough. And maybe you'll come to your senses and adventure with me, again.",""
"115740052-0-19361","Keep dreaming, Rulanir. This school is the world to me, now.",""
"115740052-0-19362","Ah! Look Emeric, your savior has arrived! Or is that your executioner?",""
"115740052-0-19363","Silence, creature!",""
"115740052-0-19364","Adeena's the one possessed. The Daedra is trying to trick you. Don't believe its lies.",""
"115740052-0-19365","No. You must believe me. You can't let it finish the ritual. You can't!",""
"115740052-0-19366","So long as that thing lives, so does the ritual. You have to kill it to end this!",""
"115740052-0-19367","Auggh!",""
"115740052-0-19368","Please! Listen to me! If the ritual completes, who knows how many innocent lives may be lost.",""
"115740052-0-19369","<<1>>, what happened to you? You are in a terrible state.",""
"115740052-0-19370","Are you aware of the danger I was in?",""
"115740052-0-19371","But where is your pack? And where is <<1>>?",""
"115740052-0-19372","<<1>>! <<1>>? I've been wasting away like a common beggar, and you ask after the monkey?",""
"115740052-0-19373","I must ensure he does not lose his way again.",""
"115740052-0-19374","I suppose I must say goodbye, my friend. I'll see you on the other side ….",""
"115740052-0-19375","To come so far and fail. I know it burns. He's dead though, and the Covenant will be too. Unless you think you can pull him back from the afterlife …. Ha!",""
"115740052-0-19376","I shall write about how awful you are as a guide!",""
"115740052-0-19377","Hold your tongue, High Elf! King Camoran didn't need Queen Ayrenn's help—never asked for it, in fact!",""
"115740052-0-19378","Why is that humorous?",""
"115740052-0-19379","Here! Use the <<1>>!",""
"115740052-0-19380","You're here too? Can you get us back? It's quite pleasant here, but I'm not ready to die yet! We can't let them win!",""
"115740052-0-19381","No reason in particular.",""
"115740052-0-19382","If Queen Ayrenn hadn't saved your hides at Cormount, you would have lost the civil war. You lot owe your lives and your allegience to the Altmer.",""
"115740052-0-19383","You haughty High Elf bastard! The Wood Elves don't owe allegiance to anyone. Least of all finely-bred fools such as yourself!",""
"115740052-0-19384","What do you think, traveler? I can't speak to this High Elf bastard any longer. He's so well-educated and wise that he can barely function.",""
"115740052-0-19385","Tell me, does the goddess also see her own doom? I reserve a special place for her glorious soul!",""
"115740052-0-19386","Enjoy your victory while it lasts. I will return, again and again, until all bow before me.",""
"115740052-0-19387","Hush now, Emeric. Your death matters little—there are other kings. It's this one I wanted. The one who's been holding the Covenant together at every turn. The vestige from Coldharbour.","Taci ora, Emeric. La tua morte non ha importanza - ci sono altri re. Cost<<player{ui/ei}>> è ciò che voglio. Col<<player{ui/ei}>> che ha tenuto unito il Concordato dopo ogni vicissitudine. Lo spirito di Coldharbour."
"115740052-0-19388","Didn't think I knew, did you? I did, and I knew I couldn't kill you  … on Mundus. Here though, you're severed from Coldharbour, from your soul. Here, you're stuck. Goodbye now.",""
"115740052-0-19389","Insolent necromancer! The Far Shores is no prison in which you can place your enemies! You dare to come here and then expect to leave freely? I think not.",""
"115740052-0-19390","You though, are no less a fool. An honorable fool, but a fool nonetheless. Hm. Very well, though. I have an offer: slay this wretched woman and you and your liege can return to the Mundus.",""
"115740052-0-19391","I'll leave whenever I damn well please … but I'll enjoy teaching you both a lesson in power first.",""
"115740052-0-19392","Lashgikh, I hear your oath. Osgrikh the Minor turned my Oathbound against you—one of my own.",""
"115740052-0-19393","Malacath, God of Curses, I appeal to you in my rage!",""
"115740052-0-19394","And you seek justice for this? Good. Then your anger is my anger.",""
"115740052-0-19395","Ah, bravo, mortal! Your powers of perception are strong indeed! Unfortunately, twins share the same blood! How vexing! Pity I didn't think of it sooner, it might have saved us all a great deal of talking.",""
"115740052-0-19396","The ritual is complete! And my first act will be to reclaim my body and destroy you!",""
"115740052-0-19397","You did it. Just like you said you would. My men are alive because of you.",""
"115740052-0-19398","My better half lies dead. My blood burns. My blade hungers.",""
"115740052-0-19399","It was your Queen's duty to protect us, High Elf! All of us. It doesn't mean your people can lord over the Bosmer.",""
"115740052-0-19400","If that's what you want to believe, Wood Elf ….",""
"115740052-0-19401","Shut your mouth, Faindor! You're a horrible youth!",""
"115740052-0-19402","You need to learn your place, Wood Elf. It's below my foot.",""
"115740052-0-19403","Your people are oppressors disguised as our protectors! We don't need you—or your military!",""
"115740052-0-19404","Finally, this one gets some attention!",""
"115740052-0-19405","You'll start a riot, you fool! This isn't the way!",""
"115740052-0-19406","You! Stop that at once!",""
"115740052-0-19407","Quickly now … I don't know how long we'll have this privacy.",""
"115740052-0-19408","How dare you go through my things!",""
"115740052-0-19409","Something's happening! I think it's working!",""
"115740052-0-19410","No! Let me go!",""
"115740052-0-19411","I've seen the girl. It's not too late.",""
"115740052-0-19412","You there, explain yourself! What are you doing in my home?",""
"115740052-0-19413","It's the Smelly Room. That <<z:1>> lit the hallways when <<2>> carried it back from the Constellation Room.",""
"115740052-0-19414","Papa!",""
"115740052-0-19415","Behold … the Forbidden Room! I come here to think sometimes. It's where <<1>> left the book she wrote in when she put <<2>> to sleep.",""
"115740052-0-19416","I don't like the Moaning Room. All the servants used to live in the cages. But <<1>> brought that <<z:2>> back here, I'm sure of it.",""
"115740052-0-19417","Hazzi! I am where the birds roost! Come!",""
"115740052-0-19418","You are mistaken, friend.",""
"115740052-0-19419","Master Ufa! You're truly alive!",""
"115740052-0-19420","Did I not send word with our friend here?",""
"115740052-0-19421","You have little choice, Niha.",""
"115740052-0-19422","Ufa! You're alive?",""
"115740052-0-19423","Wait here.",""
"115740052-0-19424","I've brought you refreshment, sir.",""
"115740052-0-19425","Niha! Always so good to me. Let's taste this fine concoction!",""
"115740052-0-19426","A strange … flavor. What kind of … wine?",""
"115740052-0-19427","Whoa, there! Are you all right? I heard fighting.",""
"115740052-0-19428","Bleating like a cut lamb, I see.",""
"115740052-0-19429","Ufa! I thought you were dead!",""
"115740052-0-19430","That was the intent. Get the key off his body and leave him.",""
"115740052-0-19431","Good, I'm free. Let the people know the time has come.",""
"115740052-0-19432","Light the two watchtowers. We must rise up against the Imperials!",""
"115740052-0-19433","We … must not falter. Go! Light them!",""
"115740052-0-19434","<<1>>, our friend needs your help in the Hall of Might.",""
"115740052-0-19435","The Hall of Might! So you think we've found it? Exhilarating!",""
"115740052-0-19436","Lead away, my friend!",""
"115740052-0-19437","Have you no respect for the dead?",""
"115740052-0-19438","Can you see anything up there?",""
"115740052-0-19439","<<1>>, would you be so kind as to explore the Hall of Might with our associate, here?",""
"115740052-0-19440","The Hall of Might! Of course. We shall uncover its secrets and return forthwith!",""
"115740052-0-19441","Come along then, what are we waiting for?",""
"115740052-0-19442","I hear familiar footfalls. Come closer, Vestige.",""
"115740052-0-19443","They were quite terrifying, even when projecting my construct in their midst.",""
"115740052-0-19444","The show shall go on!",""
"115740052-0-19445","Oh, what an unfortunate miscalculation! Five innocent deaths on your head in as many minutes …. I do hope you remember to say your prayers tonight!",""
"115740052-0-19446","Hey! How about some help, here?",""
"115740052-0-19447","First those nobles and now you cretins? You don't belong here!",""
"115740052-0-19448","What in Oblivion? Lashgikh! I'll crush you all!",""
"115740052-0-19449","What? Could that filth spirit away all of Falinesti?",""
"115740052-0-19450","Ha! Here we are. One flawed Akaviri depiction of my people.",""
"115740052-0-19451","I hope you find it as amusing as I did.",""
"115740052-0-19452","Well now. I didn't expect to see you here.",""
"115740052-0-19453","You're not who I was expecting.",""
"115740052-0-19454","Oh, I'll handle that. I do love playing with locks.",""
"115740052-0-19455","See you below.",""
"115740052-0-19456","Why don't you let me open that … quietly.",""
"115740052-0-19457","Do try and keep up.",""
"115740052-0-19458","Izzara? Praise Ruptga, it is good to see you safe. Where's Adeena?",""
"115740052-0-19459","Najan, you cowardly snake. She's dead! Slain by that monster you lusted after!",""
"115740052-0-19460","No, no that can't be true! You were supposed to save her!",""
"115740052-0-19461","And what about you? Could you not have saved her? No, you were busy out here cowering behind rocks like a dog!",""
"115740052-0-19462","After all she did for you … all she sacrificed, you cast her into Oblivion for a fool's pleasure. You disgust me!",""
"115740052-0-19463","Izzara! I … I didn't know! If —",""
"115740052-0-19464","My sister deserved better than you. A better life than you.",""
"115740052-0-19465","If I ever see you again …. There aren't words for what I'll do to you.",""
"115740052-0-19466","Adeena? Oh Adeena, my love! Thank the Eight you're safe!",""
"115740052-0-19467","Hold your miserable tongue, snake! I'll not hear more of your lies!",""
"115740052-0-19468","Adeena, it was all my fault, I know …. Zeht's tears, I'm so sorry! I didn't know! I didn't —",""
"115740052-0-19469","You lusted after a Daedra, you filthy cur! A Daedra! After all I've done—all I've sacrificed! For you!",""
"115740052-0-19470","I know. I know I failed you … failed us. But if you'd only —",""
"115740052-0-19471","No, Najan! I will not. Perhaps if you'd come and faced the monster yourself. But instead you send my sister? Izzara is dead because of you!",""
"115740052-0-19472","Alwe! Moon sugar is a spice, used in many Khajiiti dishes. Calling it cat drugs is demeaning to me and my people.",""
"115740052-0-19473","Dead? By the Eight …. Adeena, I'm sorry … I'm so sorry. Adeena? Please speak to me!",""
"115740052-0-19474","I may have spoken harshly, but moon sugar is dangerous! It's used to make skooma—as your people know very well—and therefore, it's a drug. If skooma is illegal, moon sugar should also be.",""
"115740052-0-19475","Preposterous! That's like saying we should stop growing golden pears because they are used to make ale. You Elves are too much for me sometimes—always losing sight of the forest for the trees!",""
"115740052-0-19476","Over here! There's a draft coming from this book case!",""
"115740052-0-19477","Well, what do you think? Yes, you there. What are your thoughts on this?",""
"115740052-0-19478","Hear that, High Elf? The traveler agrees with me! Your people are haughty and oppressive!",""
"115740052-0-19479","I miss Khenarthi, where my people aren't judged for being who they are.",""
"115740052-0-19480","I can't believe you drug-addled cats were allowed to join the Dominion.",""
"115740052-0-19481","You see, cat? Everyone agrees. Your mind is too clouded from the moon sugar to understand that you're wrong.",""
"115740052-0-19482","Captain! What happened?",""
"115740052-0-19483","You're not fine! Who did this to you? I'll kill them!",""
"115740052-0-19484","Fine. Drink this. Now.",""
"115740052-0-19485","Easy, Nicolene. I'm fine.",""
"115740052-0-19486","Get me a healing potion, and we'll kill them together.",""
"115740052-0-19487","Oh. Much better.",""
"115740052-0-19488","Anexiel? Is that you? Oh, beloved Ruptga help me, it can't be!",""
"115740052-0-19489","And now, I'd like to present the secret history of the Red Pact.",""
"115740052-0-19490","We'll see what <<1>> thinks of your impertinent questions.",""
"115740052-0-19491","Every Wood Elf knows of the Green Pact made with Y'ffre. None may harm the forest, or use its bounty for personal gain. Only meat may be consumed to survive.",""
"115740052-0-19492","He's down here. Be ready for a fight.",""
"115740052-0-19493","We're with you, Captain!",""
"115740052-0-19494","I need to stop being a hero.",""
"115740052-0-19495","This isn't going to be remotely fun.",""
"115740052-0-19496","This performance is dedicated to someone in the crowd who helped the show go on. I don't want to embarrass them, but they know who they are.",""
"115740052-0-19497","Naruk's already left! You'll never catch him!",""
"115740052-0-19498","Choke and die!",""
"115740052-0-19499","You've ruined everything. You'll die here.",""
"115740052-0-19500","Lock the cistern gates! We'll keep them off the winch!",""

"115740052-0-19505","Don't get cocky!",""
"115740052-0-19506","Well done! Now destroy the poison barrels!",""
"115740052-0-19507","Naruk can't be far! Go after him! We'll stop the poison!",""
"115740052-0-19508","I am! I'm also watching yours!",""
"115740052-0-19509","I got one!",""
"115740052-0-19510","Well, don't get dead!",""
"115740052-0-19511","I got blood in my hair! I hate that!",""
"115740052-0-19512","Poison us? I'll gut you, dog!",""
"115740052-0-19513","Why do they always run?",""
"115740052-0-19514","Wait. What? No, my lord! I served you faithfully!",""
"115740052-0-19515","Oh no! Master, please! Spare me!",""

"115740052-0-19521","And now, I really must take this <<1>> puppet for a stroll.",""
"115740052-0-19522","Let's see how fast it can run!",""
"115740052-0-19523","My minions will destroy you!",""

"115740052-0-19545","It's my small-minded nephew, Javad. The lad was petty and cruel for the enjoyment of it. I always suspected he'd meet an untimely end. Leave him to his fate. It's kinder than he deserves.",""

"115740052-0-19558","Behold—another blight upon what was once unbroken green.",""
"115740052-0-19559","This is Haven. A prime piece of coastline the Altmer so graciously liberated from the forest. To share, they say, their immense wisdom with their poor, leaf-wearing cousins.",""
"115740052-0-19560","Tread carefully, friends. Wouldn't want the forest to swallow you up!",""
"115740052-0-19561","Let's keep going.",""
"115740052-0-19562","Come along!",""
"115740052-0-19563","That's enough for today. Let's return to Elden Root. I'm sure the humidity is getting to some of you.",""
"115740052-0-19564","Don't lie, cat man! I saw you eat that flower! I can't let you harm this forest without penance! The Green Pact demands that you pay for your indiscretions!",""
"115740052-0-19565","But this Khajiit loves to eat flowers! You're insane! Put that axe away! I have done nothing wrong!",""
"115740052-0-19566","The plants and the trees are sacred to the Bosmer—all true Bosmer, at any rate.nnI demand retribution for the flower you slaughtered and devoured!",""
"115740052-0-19567","Someone help! You there! Please, talk some sense into that Elf! He's a lunatic!",""
"115740052-0-19568","That'll show you! Ha! Did you see his face?",""
"115740052-0-19569","Now hear this, cat! I'll give you a running start, and then I'll collect your fool head!",""
"115740052-0-19570","By the Mane, you're a monster!",""
"115740052-0-19571","Sorry, cat. I let my anger get to me.",""
"115740052-0-19572","I understand. One time my brother, under the influence of skooma, also attacked me. Luckily, he could not climb trees in that state, though it was humorous to see him try.",""
"115740052-0-19573","Where is that ugly thing? It should be here!",""
"115740052-0-19574","You again?",""
"115740052-0-19575","You think me defeated so easily?",""
"115740052-0-19576","You'll have to try harder than that!",""
"115740052-0-19577","… and with one final shift ….",""

"115740052-0-19580","Do you feel that?",""
"115740052-0-19581","The others are returning!",""
"115740052-0-19582","I don't know where you found your new friends, Alanwe, but they don't seem to fear death. It's admirable.",""
"115740052-0-19583","They can speak to that better than I, but they've bested my husband's minions. We owe them everything.",""
"115740052-0-19584","Indeed.",""
"115740052-0-19585","You will have to take your compatriots and remove yourself from the embassy grounds. You're disrupting our duties here.",""
"115740052-0-19586","This one is not leaving until Khajiiti interests are represented here. Where is our embassy? Where is our voice in proceedings?",""
"115740052-0-19587","You don't understand. Your presence here is disrupting our efforts to do just that. Please, take your friends and go.",""
"115740052-0-19588","Not until our voices are heard.",""
"115740052-0-19589","Sadas! The people of Hallin's Stand demand your surrender!",""
"115740052-0-19590","If you won't surrender, your life is … forfeit!",""
"115740052-0-19591","Proud people of Hallin's Stand, we have won the day!",""
"115740052-0-19592","A stranger to our city was the spark. Let us never forget this, or those who fell in the fight!",""
"115740052-0-19593","I won't fail you again, Secundus!",""
"115740052-0-19594","I'll make you an example to these dogs!",""
"115740052-0-19595","I can't believe this! You're just going to lie down and take a nap …?",""
"115740052-0-19596","Fortunately, you won't have to.",""
"115740052-0-19597","Here, again? I mean … yes, mortal?",""
"115740052-0-19598","Emeric … I mean, Your Majesty! Thank the gods!",""
"115740052-0-19599","By the Empyrean Light—I didn't know Nerien'eth had tortured so many of us. That whoreson dog!",""
"115740052-0-19600","Oh, yes …. Come meet your sweet demise, mortal.",""
"115740052-0-19601","Easy, Faindor. He'll pay when the time comes, but we don't want you rushing off to die. Again.",""
"115740052-0-19602","Lie still, my sweet. It will all be over soon ….",""
"115740052-0-19603","Our friends killed his Daedric pets. He may come looking for us, and we need to be ready.",""
"115740052-0-19604","If you don't get back here, I'm going to do this without you!",""
"115740052-0-19605","Hands off the cheese, thief! You'll pay for this!",""
"115740052-0-19606","Grant me vengeance. Grant me justice. For the honor of my love lost.",""
"115740052-0-19607","Grant me Osgrikh and I will grant you his head in your name.",""
"115740052-0-19608","Osgrikh the Coward flies from your fury—from your champion. I will not have your rage denied! Prepare yourself and prepare your champion. Osgrikh comes to you.",""
"115740052-0-19609","Through here, everyone! Quickly!",""
"115740052-0-19610","Good work, Zungarg. As a reward, I will permit you to join me in my feast.",""
"115740052-0-19611","Zungarg! It's as I feared. He's turned. You'll pay for this, vampire scum!",""
"115740052-0-19612","Oh, please.",""
"115740052-0-19613","So this pile of moss and rubble determines the next emperor.",""
"115740052-0-19614","<<1>> is ancient. Show some respect.",""
"115740052-0-19615","It's magnificent.",""
"115740052-0-19616","Nearly there, your majesties, Your Highness!",""
"115740052-0-19617","And now the Ayleid deathtrap will tell us if we have an emperor in our midst. Truly, a momentous day.",""
"115740052-0-19618","Naemon, now is not the time.",""
"115740052-0-19619","Osgrikh lies slain. The oath is fulfilled. Your champion fought well, child.",""
"115740052-0-19620","Rise, blood of my blood. I have helped you restore your honor. But others will come for you. Show them—show me—that your rage is fiercer.",""
"115740052-0-19621","Shard of Aetherius, fall upon us now and anoint us with your blessing.",""
"115740052-0-19622","It's done, friend. We should talk.",""
"115740052-0-19623","It's working! It's actually working!",""
"115740052-0-19624","Good luck, walker. Maybe I'll see you around.",""
"115740052-0-19625","Not bad—for a bunch of drunken slobs. Ha ha!",""
"115740052-0-19626","Hope you enjoyed the show, friend. We do take pride in what we are. Now you can, too.",""
"115740052-0-19627","Hey Champion! Yeah, I'm talking to you!",""
"115740052-0-19628","I lost a bunch of coin betting against you!",""
"115740052-0-19629","I ever find you in a dark alley, and I'm getting my coins back!",""
"115740052-0-19630","My friend, do you see that striking walker over there? That … that is the Champion. The one that took down Ishalga.",""
"115740052-0-19631","No, it's true. This one won many coins that day. Most impressive.",""
"115740052-0-19632","You don't say? That one doesn't look all that tough.",""
"115740052-0-19633","I guess looks can be decieving. Never would have guessed.",""
"115740052-0-19634","You can't be serious! How can we possibly trust him?",""
"115740052-0-19635","As our visitor so eloquently pointed out, we cannot. But if we are to locate Sai Sahan, we must do this. Go with the Vestige, Lyris. Rescue Tharn. Give him the chance to redeem himself. He may surprise you.",""
"115740052-0-19636","No! Esmaeel! Is he …?",""
"115740052-0-19637","Why am I not surprised to find Cadwell here? He certainly does get around.",""
"115740052-0-19638","You've doomed yourself by coming here—you know that, don't you?",""
"115740052-0-19639","You were a fool to come back, Lashgikh!",""
"115740052-0-19640","Lashgikh! I'll make gloves from your skin!",""
"115740052-0-19641","The head of Thrug. He brought it on himself. Let's go.",""
"115740052-0-19642","Larzgug's cruelty often outstripped that of her brothers. It was the only way to gain recognition in her family.",""
"115740052-0-19643","Begone, insufferable Worms! I'm working as fast as I can!",""
"115740052-0-19644","We've got everything we need for the ritual. Come, friend. Let's have a word.",""
"115740052-0-19645","I'm shocked your lack of education and repeated blows to the head haven't dulled your wit, Titanborn.",""
"115740052-0-19646","This might be what we're looking for! Come to me!",""
"115740052-0-19647","The portal transfer is complete.",""
"115740052-0-19648","Good, it's who we've been expecting. You're in no danger here, friend. Come, let us speak.",""
"115740052-0-19649","I can, and I shall! Where is the Amulet of Kings?",""
"115740052-0-19650","Clear your mind and study the scrolls. The answer will become apparent.",""
"115740052-0-19651","Very well. You have my blessing. Now you must seek my son's spirit. Speak to Divad.",""
"115740052-0-19652","Thank you for honoring my mother's memory. You have my blessing. Now you must seek out Makela Leki.",""
"115740052-0-19653","I'll figure something out. I always do.",""
"115740052-0-19654","I don't take kindly to people snooping around my dice game. Nothing personal, but you'll have to die!",""
"115740052-0-19655","Get this fool, my darlings!",""
"115740052-0-19656","Be quiet! We're being watched.",""
"115740052-0-19657","Oh gods! You're ruthless! Please … no more! You're really scaring me now! I'm going back to Arnitole!",""
"115740052-0-19658","I'll begin the ritual.",""
"115740052-0-19659","You seek to enter the Vaults? All those within would pay dearly to leave it!",""
"115740052-0-19660","<<1>> will see our plight and understand, as a fellow of noble birth and bearing. He must! It's his … his noble duty.",""
"115740052-0-19661","Father, there's no such obligation. We aren't his bannermen. By the Divines, we're from Wayrest! What reason could he possibly have to help us? And what help are you expecting, anyway?",""
"115740052-0-19662","Where is the downside for him? Through granting us an army, he sees a new and permanent ally in High Rock. And we retake our holdings, reestablish our standing. It's a good deal for us all, you see?",""
"115740052-0-19663","Father, do you realize how this sounds? What happens when your wish isn't granted? You should really step back and look at yourself.",""
"115740052-0-19664","Well … as you can probably guess, father was laughed out of court. I don't really know what he expected, making demands of <<1>> like that.",""
"115740052-0-19665","I expected as much. I don't know what more I could've done, beyond physically restraining him. And I'm not about to tie my father down.",""
"115740052-0-19666","I don't know what we should do now. I heard there's a settlement of Colovian descent somewhere called <<1>>. We could go there. I mean, if we're no longer welcome here, that is.",""
"115740052-0-19667","No. No, from what I've heard, we absolutely do not want to go to <<1>>. Better for us to just stay here. Maybe find work as mercenaries.",""
"115740052-0-19669","Gasteau—you look good, considering. It's been ages.",""
"115740052-0-19670","It has been. Are you well?",""
"115740052-0-19671","Hardly. I think we've made a mistake.",""
"115740052-0-19672","I regret nothing—look at what Dutheil's become.",""
"115740052-0-19673","We've created a monster. All these souls he tortures for the Daedra.",""
"115740052-0-19674","Don't ever—Dutheil, the Mad Architect, did this. Not us.",""
"115740052-0-19675","<Blood-curdling scream. This text should not be played.>",""
"115740052-0-19676","I hope you're not skittish about heights. That's a long drop.",""
"115740052-0-19677","<Blood-curdling scream. This text should not be played.>",""
"115740052-0-19678","This one notices the plans will be placing the Khajiit Embassy where our camp presently is, yes? This is a good place, <<1>> is thinking.",""
"115740052-0-19679","A good place for travelling Khajiit to rest or chat, and its close proximity to the Elden Tree makes trade convenient. It's good for everyone, really.",""
"115740052-0-19680","<<1>> knows that we cannot cut wood of the trees of <<2>>. We could import the wood, from <<3>>, perhaps?",""
"115740052-0-19681","As you wish. Sai Sahan has something he wanted to ask you as well. You should go to him.",""
"115740052-0-19682","But few Wood Elves know of the deal struck before … some say with Molag Bal himself!",""
"115740052-0-19683","Indeed, the Red Pact forbade the consumption of meat. It mandated the trees be cut down for homes, and fruit and vegetables alone sustain the Wood Elf people.",""
"115740052-0-19684","Shocking, I know! But Molag Bal wished to keep the Wood Elves weak and sickly, by making them eat the very forest around them.",""
"115740052-0-19685","Such is what the God of Schemes planned … a slow death brought to the heart of Y'ffre's power.","Questo è ciò che vuole il Dio degli Intrighi... Una morte lenta portata al cuore del potere di Y'ffre."
"115740052-0-19686","But the God of the Forest was no fool. Approaching the dwindling, sickly Wood Elves and noting their grass-stained teeth, Y'ffre offered them a deal.",""
"115740052-0-19687","They would make a new deal, a fresh Green Pact, and the forest itself would always defend them.",""
"115740052-0-19688","And so the Wood Elves accepted Y'ffre's offer. The Meat Mandate defied Molag Bal's Red Pact, as did the bone and leather used to build their homes.",""
"115740052-0-19689","Molag Bal's rage was great. He would repay the breaking of the Red Pact with the devouring of <<1>> ….",""
"115740052-0-19690","Everyone knows the tale of <<1>>, how Molag Bal devoured an entire Wood Elf city.",""
"115740052-0-19691","But few know it was <<c:1>> who kept the God of Schemes from eating all of the Valenwood!","Ma pochi sanno che fu <<c:1>> ad impedire al Dio degli Intrighi di impossessarsi di tutta Valenwood!"
"115740052-0-19692","For <<c:1>> knew Molag Bal had a single weakness … the thrum of a perfectly tuned lute.",""
"115740052-0-19693","So he called upon the greatest lute-player in the Valenwood to send the Daedric Prince back to <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-19694","And so Emerald Spinner Agon strode into the ruins of <<1>>, ivory lute slung across his shoulders like a Nord's greatsword.",""
"115740052-0-19695","As the first strum rolled through the blasted town, the God of Schemes stayed his wire-wrapped fist from impaling its last dozen inhabitants.","Mentre la prima bordata traversava la città dannata, il Dio degli Intrighi arrestò il proprio pugno fasciato prima di trapassare l'ultima dozzina di abitanti."
"115740052-0-19696","The second strum drew the Father of Vampires from the ravaged town. He loomed over Agon with rapt attention.",""
"115740052-0-19697","But the final strum drew forth a single tear from the Lord of Brutality's eye. ""Today you share the one beauty I cannot destroy,"" he whispered.",""
"115740052-0-19698","We'll never know Agon's response, for the Daedric Prince's tear fell upon him and dissolved him in an instant. Only after Molag Bal's departure could <<c:1>> gather his remains.",""
"115740052-0-19699","Emerald Spinner Agon and his ivory lute were buried beneath the first graht-oak planted by the great King Eplear, founder of the Camoran throne ….",""
"115740052-0-19700","I'm certain everyone here knows of the great Eplear. First king of the Valenwood, founder of the Camoran dynasty … this tale is familiar to us all.",""
"115740052-0-19701","Yet the tale of King Eplear's ascension is rarely told. His life began as a simple ox-herd on the plains of Valen. You heard me, the plains! For back then, Tamriel was an endless sea of grass.",""
"115740052-0-19702","One day young Eplear encountered a merchant and her mother. Enchanted with the merchant's beauty, he asked how he might pursue her heart.",""
"115740052-0-19703","""When trees choke the Valen plains and the forest crowns you king … only then shall you hold my daughter's hand in marriage!"" grumbled the merchant's mother.",""
"115740052-0-19704","Eplear thought a moment, nodded, and shook the mother's hand. Then he purchased every acorn in the merchant's possession.",""
"115740052-0-19705","Eplear the ox-herd traveled across the Valen plains. Where his oxen stopped to feed, he planted acorns in upturned soil. Everywhere he went, he planted.",""
"115740052-0-19706","Graht-oaks soon sprouted from the Valen plains. He collected their acorns, traveled, and planted once more. Soon the Valen plains became the Valenwood.",""
"115740052-0-19707","The spriggans thought Eplear a powerful wizard. Where he traveled, the graht-oaks grew. They sought him out, and humbled themselves before him.",""
"115740052-0-19708","""O great Eplear,"" they cried, ""how can we thank one who has given us so much?"" Eplear thought but a moment. ""With a crown,"" he said.",""
"115740052-0-19709","And so King Eplear won the hand of the merchant Camoran. The affection of the spriggans would one day form the basis of the Green Pact ….",""
"115740052-0-19710","What's this? It looks like me! What in damnation is going on here?",""
"115740052-0-19711","That's Tharn's voice! What is he doing here?",""
"115740052-0-19712","For how could I let you risk your life in this contraption without testing it first, dear sister?",""
"115740052-0-19713","It's incredible … I can see the White-Gold Tower! I …. No! What's happening to me?",""
"115740052-0-19714","You cannot remain in the Far Shores, mortal. It's time for you to go.",""
"115740052-0-19715","Captain, look! It's the stranger who saved us!",""
"115740052-0-19716","No! The tower … it's fading. What have I ….",""
"115740052-0-19717","Naemon. What were you thinking?",""
"115740052-0-19718","Around the world!",""
"115740052-0-19719","I'll meet you in town.",""
"115740052-0-19720","Put a cork in it, Tharn! Sai's my friend. Probably the best friend I have. If the Vestige is going, I'm going too!",""
"115740052-0-19721","Yes, I see. And you are the most qualified, why? Is it your superior knowledge of Coldharbour? Your expertise in dealing with Daedric entities? Or is it simply the unrequited puppy love you feel for that shirtless mammoth?",""
"115740052-0-19722","Alert! Intruders!",""
"115740052-0-19723","Such an unpleasant and unclean creature! I am sure you have many questions, Vestige.",""
"115740052-0-19724","Your soul is mine!",""
"115740052-0-19725","Show us your Dwarf impression!",""
"115740052-0-19726","Welcome to Rivenspire! Land of women and war!",""
"115740052-0-19727","Pirates? In <<1>>? <<2>>'s Jade Dragoons would throw them into the sea!",""
"115740052-0-19728","If she was there! But they marched out, left the city completely undefended!",""
"115740052-0-19729","I need to get back to my superiors. With any luck these bastards will still be in disarray when we sweep back through here.",""
"115740052-0-19730","<<1>> is a hero. There's no way she'd abandon <<2>> to pirates.",""
"115740052-0-19731","Farewell. They won't be catching me again. A week down here was very motivating.",""
"115740052-0-19732","I need a vacation.",""
"115740052-0-19733","What is this foolishness? Has your tiny mortal mind snapped? Do you really think you can defeat me?",""
"115740052-0-19734","I am God of Oblivion! You are less than nothing!",""
"115740052-0-19735","Still you fight on? Do you care nothing for your own existence?",""
"115740052-0-19736","Your anguish will be legendary, even in Oblivion!",""
"115740052-0-19737","You won't get away with this. Do you really think you can betray a Daedric Prince?",""
"115740052-0-19738","With the Amulet of Kings, all things are possible! Nations will tremble and bow before me! I will be a god!",""
"115740052-0-19739","The Amulet of Kings will never be yours! It is protected by a ward of the Divines!",""

"115740052-0-19826","What are frost trolls doing in <<1>>? Or soldiers, for that matter? Wait, what about your friend in the Falinesti Faithful?",""

"115740052-0-19836","You should go to <<Ac:1>> and see for yourself. I can look after your affairs. It would be no trouble.",""
"115740052-0-19837","Dank corridors, crumbling walls, nauseating smells. This place has all the charm of a Riften brothel. It must feel very much like home to you, Titanborn.",""
"115740052-0-19838","You mean a crypt filled with the rotting corpses of inbred kings and failed statesmen. Must be what it's like at a Tharn family reunion.",""
"115740052-0-19839","It is much more pleasant in the summer months.",""
"115740052-0-19840","I thought you might need some assistance, once I learned that Reezal-Jul had dragged hostages into this old place.",""
"115740052-0-19841","You are just in time. Baron Montclair has departed, but Reezal-Jul is here. I am anxious to put an end to that foul Argonian.",""
"115740052-0-19842","Just tell me where the amulet is and we can be together forever, Sai. Isn't that what we both want?",""
"115740052-0-19843","Pull it together mutts, we've got a new scamp that's ready to risk life and limb for glory.",""
"115740052-0-19844","And I say we welcome the scamp as only we know how!",""
"115740052-0-19845","I could always use an assistant—or a scribe to record my exploits.",""
"115740052-0-19846","I think the new blood could help me in the privy. I'm not supposed to lift anything heavy.",""
"115740052-0-19847","You're looking pretty light from here, Felvyn.nnI propose a toast to the newcomer!",""
"115740052-0-19848","Hear, hear! A toast!",""

"115740052-0-19850","Hear, hear!",""
"115740052-0-19851","To those who fall in battle to the new scamp. How shameful it must be—to look upon that ugly face as the last thing you see.",""
"115740052-0-19852","Ha ha!",""
"115740052-0-19853","To those who fall in love with the scamp! For they have sacrificed so much, for so little.",""
"115740052-0-19854","To the new scamp's blacksmith. Unused swords rarely need repair!",""
"115740052-0-19855","Fine toasts one and all! Now for the song!",""
"115740052-0-19856","Waddaya say we show 'em a proper welcome to the club?",""

"115740052-0-19863","Not bad - for a bunch of half-wit drunks. Hah!",""
"115740052-0-19864","Take pride in being Undaunted, scamp. Your deeds will live on long after your body fails.",""
"115740052-0-19865","Do you really think that death can stop the most powerful necromancer Tamriel has ever known?",""
"115740052-0-19866","This is merely a transition! My first step towards true immortality!",""
"115740052-0-19867","Now witness my true power! Watch as I rise up from the grave and ascend to godhood!",""
"115740052-0-19868","Worm! You think you can betray the Lord of Brutality and Domination without consequence?",""
"115740052-0-19869","You will pay for your arrogance! You will writhe in agony for the rest of eternity! Your tortured screams will echo throughout Oblivion to serve as a warning to others!",""
"115740052-0-19870","Welcome to Rivenspire! Land of beautiful women and an ugly war!",""
"115740052-0-19871","Miserable fools! You are nothing! I am Mannimarco!",""

"115740052-0-19880","Finally! I'm not the new guy anymore.",""
"115740052-0-19881","Nope. You'll always be the new guy, Mindil.",""
"115740052-0-19882","Enough. Let's get this over with.",""
"115740052-0-19883","Always such a ray of sunshine, Talisse. Now a toast from everyone: To the new meat! May they never wet their pants except from drink!",""
"115740052-0-19884","To the new meat, whose best attack is showing their face!",""
"115740052-0-19885","To the new meat! Too brave to run, too dumb to dodge!",""
"115740052-0-19886","To the new meat: Don't die.",""
"115740052-0-19887","Really?",""
"115740052-0-19888","Just sing the damn song.",""

"115740052-0-19900","I am worry that Captain Janeve will try to take on Tainted-Heart by herself.",""
"115740052-0-19901","You filth! You'll not get past me!",""
"115740052-0-19902","You elected to have such narrow avenues ascending the Elden Tree? It's not how we'd do it in Summerset.",""
"115740052-0-19903","Hardly surprising. But I dislike the tight climb myself. Truthfully, I prefer the open spaces of the Middens.",""
"115740052-0-19904","That sounds positively dreadful.",""
"115740052-0-19905","Hey you! What are you doing slinking around my ship?",""
"115740052-0-19906","Ah! There you are. When you have a moment, find me at the Harborage. I've got a question for you.",""
"115740052-0-19907","Ugh. Tamriel. How do you stand it?",""
"115740052-0-19908","What is this? Infant! Do you think your toy can slay a god?",""
"115740052-0-19909","No!",""
"115740052-0-19910","Why do you torment me?",""
"115740052-0-19911","Buttons! No!",""
"115740052-0-19912","And the living Undaunted returns! Still living!",""
"115740052-0-19913","The Blacksap light the flame blue today. It's quite glorious, isn't it?",""
"115740052-0-19914","Yes, it means good things are coming ….",""
"115740052-0-19915","You killed her. You freed us. Haha!",""
"115740052-0-19916","Hush up, we're being watched.",""
"115740052-0-19918","Your continued meddling has reached an end, Hero of Tamriel!",""
"115740052-0-19919","So the spider-slayer returns! Heard you cleared those cobwebs with prejudice!",""
"115740052-0-19920","Why is it so still? I'd heard the graht-oaks never stop moving.",""
"115740052-0-19921","Perhaps it grew tired of wandering and is resting? Or perhaps it has always been thus.",""
"115740052-0-19922","Whatever the answer, it now marks the center of the Dominion! Even Summerset acknowledges its might!",""
"115740052-0-19923","So long as it stands tall, we will prosper under the shadow of its boughs.",""
"115740052-0-19924","I thought the Bosmer worshipped only Hircine!",""
"115740052-0-19925","A common misconception, and there are many who do. Fortunately, the practice seems to be losing favor. With the formation of the Dominion, it may be a difficult tradition to maintain.",""
"115740052-0-19926","A pity. Even a brief hunt through the Valenwood would yield prey worthy of Hungry Cat's claws.",""
"115740052-0-19927","<<1>>! You worship Daedra?",""
"115740052-0-19928","No, no! But it is a romantic notion, is it not?",""
"115740052-0-19929","Is there truth to these rumors or is this another Bosmer story?",""
"115740052-0-19930","I'm not sure I know what you mean by Bosmer story, friend. But it is true! I have seen them with my own eyes.",""
"115740052-0-19931","Doubtful. Though I must admit, my curiosity is piqued.",""
"115740052-0-19932","Mine, as well! Perhaps we should arrange a nocturnal visit!",""
"115740052-0-19933","That can be arranged, though I must warn you—Daedra have been seen in the area.",""
"115740052-0-19934","You're no bandit. Not like the others, at least.",""
"115740052-0-19935","Thank you for that. Now let me do my part.",""
"115740052-0-19936","Now, as I'm sure you've all noticed, the Elden Tree is impressively tall. Equally impressive is that <<1>>'s throne lies in the tallest branches of the tree.",""
"115740052-0-19937","Excuse me. Is it really at the top? If so, how would one get up there to meet with him?",""
"115740052-0-19938","The trunk has three landings within it. The topmost one takes you to the king's throne. The climb is worth it, I assure you!",""
"115740052-0-19939","Of course, <<1>> has a significant presence of both the Fighters and Mages Guilds. We have sizable halls for both within the tree.",""
"115740052-0-19940","Within the tree? How would one find them? The tree is so large.",""
"115740052-0-19941","They're easy to find! The trunk has three landings within it, and the middle landing—the one with the shrine—will have passageways to both guildhalls.",""
"115740052-0-19942","Additionally, <<1>> has many of its labor facilities, homes, and other elements of the community suspended within the Elden Tree's branches. Isn't that exciting?",""
"115740052-0-19943","On the branches? Is that safe? Is it easy to stumble off of these areas?",""
"115740052-0-19944","Well … yes. That's why you must watch your step while on the platforms!",""
"115740052-0-19945","As you may have encountered, all throughout Valenwood live the spinners—the most faithful devotees of Y'ffre, our most important god.",""
"115740052-0-19946","How would this one know a spinner apart from other Bosmer? Not to sound rude, but this one has trouble telling Elves apart.",""
"115740052-0-19947","There are three around you now! Look for the Bosmer sitting in scenic places, for they will not move without being moved. All that Spinners should ever do is tell stories, according to Y'ffre.",""
"115740052-0-19948","I'm <<1>>, a bug wrangler. What does that mean? Perhaps my little friends here can show you.",""
"115740052-0-19949","But that is a tale for another time. Thank you!",""
"115740052-0-19950","All finished mucking about in the sewers, are we? Heard it was noble delinquents stirring things up. I take it you taught them a lesson.",""
"115740052-0-19951","Some of our Undaunted brethren say you delved into the Crypt of Hearts—and reported the sounds of supernatural battle. I guess the fools were too cowardly to follow you! Ha!",""
"115740052-0-19952","See how it rises above the ruins of Ayleidoon! A testament to the strength and vigor of the Bosmer people!",""
"115740052-0-19953","A fine tree! Think of the ships we could build with one so tall!",""
"115740052-0-19954","Indeed. A pity the life of the tree is so prized by the Bosmer. They've made some sort of accord with Hircine to preserve such things. Civilized Mer should look past such trivialties.",""
"115740052-0-19955","Can you not see the strength it affords us? The Graht-oak of <<1>> has stood for millenia! It has sheltered and fed thousands!",""
"115740052-0-19956","And what has it gotten you? The Bosmer sit idly by in their borders, warring among themselves until the mer of value have to step in on your behalf.",""
"115740052-0-19957","Better to chop it down for tinder. The forest will hardly miss a few trees.",""
"115740052-0-19958","Thrice blasted son of a dreck-sifting root-munching bread-baking sot! May your ears be stuffed with whirlifly larvae, your bow-hand bitten by a rabid stoat ….nnMoving on!",""
"115740052-0-19959","Forgive my ignorance, honored guide, but what is a hoarvor? <<1>> has never heard of such a thing.",""
"115740052-0-19960","Not spent much time in the Valenwood, eh? Haven't happened upon one of the blood-swilling, scampering, filth-ridden beasts that ….",""
"115740052-0-19961","Your people are held very close to the heart of the Dominion, where they will remain for quite a time. Does that about sum up your sentiment, <<1>>?",""
"115740052-0-19962","Erm … yes. That about covers it.",""
"115740052-0-19963","Is that Sarandel's Carnival? Oh, I love their trained shalks!",""
"115740052-0-19964","It is good to see such a gleaming beacon of culture amidst all of this … wilderness.",""
"115740052-0-19965","Shalks? Do they not spit fire and breathe flame? Is that not dangerous in a forest?",""
"115740052-0-19966","A little singed foliage is a small price to pay for such novelties. I simply must return after the conclusion of our tour.",""
"115740052-0-19967","A little singed—<<1>> must be told of this madness!",""
"115740052-0-19968","And rightly so. A natural harbor fit with moorings barely capable of supporting light watercraft. We did you a favor.",""
"115740052-0-19969","<<1>> must agree. While your preservation of the green is laudable, trade was stagnant before the Altmer opened Haven for trade.",""
"115740052-0-19970","It's not that we don't appreciate the … help provided us by the High Elves. But why trade when the forest supplies all we need?",""
"115740052-0-19971","Begging your pardon, <<1>>, but isn't your bow shaped from Cherrywood? Or did one of your trees give it to you?",""
"115740052-0-19972","Enough. I admit trade agreements have their place—especially in a war—but what are we fighting for if Bosmer traditions are lost as a result?",""
"115740052-0-19973","Honestly, you would think we chopped down the Valenwood! We are paying your traditions as much heed as we can, as far as we understand them! And we've done what we had to—to maintain civilized conduct!",""
"115740052-0-19974","We'll see if you can stop yourself there. I rather doubt it.",""
"115740052-0-19975","Preposterous! I'm an Aldmeri vicereeve, an assistant to <<1>> himself! Why am I barred from the ceremony?",""
"115740052-0-19976","<<1>> hasn't been activated in a millennia. It might work splendidly, yes. Or it might explode. But I'll speak with <<2>> if you insist on being present.",""
"115740052-0-19977","I …. Upon consideration, I suppose I could wait by the door. To call for help, should anything go wrong.",""
"115740052-0-19978","Little brother, you shouldn't be here for this. <<1>> warned us of the dangers.",""
"115740052-0-19979","I won't turn my back on family. My place is in your shadow, as it has always been.",""
"115740052-0-19980","I know this can't be easy for you.",""
"115740052-0-19981","On the contrary. Today the Dominion shall see why a High Elf is fit to lead all of Tamriel.",""
"115740052-0-19982","I used to despise your certainty. But today it's … reassuring, oddly enough.",""
"115740052-0-19983","Apology accepted.",""
"115740052-0-19984","(laughter)",""
"115740052-0-19985","I guess you fancy yourself the new ruler of Volenfell, now that you've conquered it. Too bad all your subjects are dead!",""
"115740052-0-19986","I'm not sure what we're allowed to eat, anymore. The Dominion's got all these rules.",""
"115740052-0-19987","It's mostly the same. Essentially, you can eat anything you could before, just not anything that talks.",""
"115740052-0-19988","Really? That's a relief. I don't think I did that very much, anyway. Too troublesome.",""
"115740052-0-19989","I'm not sure I like how different things are now. All these High Elves and Khajiit in our forest. It's odd.",""
"115740052-0-19990","Oh, come on. You're a gatherer, how has their being here affected you at all?",""
"115740052-0-19991","Well, now they tell me places I can't go, because there might be an army there or something stupid like that.",""
"115740052-0-19992","I'll make sure everyone clears out, as you requested. But you don't need to be here, Your Highness.",""
"115740052-0-19993","I used to sneak in here as a child and climb through <<c:1>>'s rungs! Do you think I'd pass up on the chance to see what it actually does? But have no fear, I want you at the outer door.",""
"115740052-0-19994","Thank you, your majesty. I won't let you down.",""
"115740052-0-19995","You never do.",""
"115740052-0-19996","Ho, ho, the captain's dead! Captain Blackheart's dead! And here comes the one who done the deed ….",""
"115740052-0-19997","Well, if it isn't the king of Fungal Grotto! Tell me, is your head heavier now that you're the king?",""
"115740052-0-19998","I heard you fell into a scuffle at Darkshade, new blood! Did you teach those Kwama a lesson? Tell me, how hard is it to squash a bug?",""
"115740052-0-19999","The milksop returns victorious! The milksop is a dangerous milksop, I see!",""
"115740052-0-20000","You're back, new blood! Heard you wrestled with lamias in that old Imperial fort! How'd you like it?",""
"115740052-0-20001","I heard you and those mages ran headfirst into something evil in Elden Hollow. Good to see you live to delve again!",""
"115740052-0-20002","Heard you fought a fierce battle in Direfrost Keep, new blood! Our brethren said they heard fierce storms raging before you emerged! Must've been an epic battle!",""
"115740052-0-20003","Where are you going? I need to get back to Geirmund's Hall.",""
"115740052-0-20004","What is this? Are you Champion of the Crucible now, new blood? I heard you put on quite the display!",""
"115740052-0-20005","I heard those Daedra you faced at the City of Ash were led by Mehrunes Dagon himself! You must be a beast in battle, my friend!",""
"115740052-0-20006","People are still talking about that battle on Tempest Island. Did you really kill a hundred Maormer with your bare hands? Alone?",""
"115740052-0-20007","Hrm. Heard you ran into a changeling in Selene's Web! And survived! You might just be worth a damn.",""
"115740052-0-20008","By the eight… look!",""
"115740052-0-20009","So, you're telling me that no matter what happens, anything I put here will be safe?",""
"115740052-0-20010","Yes. We've never been robbed. Our security is peerless.",""
"115740052-0-20011","Excellent. I'll need you to take care of this for me, then. Keep it safe.",""
"115740052-0-20012","What do you mean, gone? I thought your security was peerless!",""
"115740052-0-20013","It is! Or, it was! Either way, I'll get to the bottom of this. I promise you!",""
"115740052-0-20014","We will get to the bottom of this. Don't forget, it's my property that's missing.",""
"115740052-0-20015","So, they didn't force the gate. What else do we know?",""
"115740052-0-20016","The guards saw nobody. And there's no sign the lockboxes were forced open.",""
"115740052-0-20017","So … what, then? Was I robbed by a ghost? There must be something else at play.",""
"115740052-0-20018","So we've ruled it out. I wasn't robbed by a ghost. Sounds like an inside job, to me.",""
"115740052-0-20019","There's no chance! Every access to the vault happens in pairs. We monitor one another!",""
"115740052-0-20020","If you say so. A bribe goes a long way. Even when you double it.",""
"115740052-0-20021","How do I know you didn't rob the place? That'd be a clever way to do it.",""
"115740052-0-20022","There is a troll in that vault. It cannot be pacified by one person alone.",""
"115740052-0-20023","You're right, I suppose. Still, I'll find the s'wit who did this. And then I'll feed the troll.",""
"115740052-0-20024","You're kidding me. Everything just … reappeared? Including my goods? How?",""
"115740052-0-20025","Yes, the Mages Guild neglected to inform us of the particulars of their vault. It seems your goods were temporarily stored … well, somewhere in Oblivion.",""
"115740052-0-20026","Ha! As long as my goods are safe, I don't care where it's stored. Who's going to rob <<1>>?",""
"115740052-0-20027","We heard sounds of battle! What happened?",""
"115740052-0-20028","There was an accident. My brother gave his life to protect us. He died a hero.",""
"115740052-0-20029","I … I don't ….",""
"115740052-0-20030","I will soon go to <<1>>. <<2>>, I want you to travel ahead with my brother's body. You will make the funeral arrangements.",""
"115740052-0-20031","Yes … yes, your majesty. I understand.",""
"115740052-0-20032","Spare no expense for his funeral. All in the Dominion are welcome. All may pay their respects to a hero.",""
"115740052-0-20033","At once, your majesty.",""
"115740052-0-20034","Is this really happening?",""
"115740052-0-20035","I don't know what you mean.",""
"115740052-0-20036","You must have seen! You arrived near the end of it.",""
"115740052-0-20037","The queen says her brother died a hero. So that's what I saw.",""
"115740052-0-20038","Do all you Vinedusk Rangers learn to ignore the truth?",""
"115740052-0-20039","We learn that leadership is messy. And because royalty must grieve in public, we learn not to judge.",""
"115740052-0-20040","Perhaps you're right.",""
"115740052-0-20041","Good luck, hunter. It's time for me to pass on and rejoin the cycle.",""
"115740052-0-20042","<<1>> sent someone to the embassy. We have to leave before we're discovered!",""
"115740052-0-20043","<<1>>? We had assurances. How can we make him our puppet if we can't control him?",""
"115740052-0-20044","It's too late. For the Heritance!",""
"115740052-0-20045","On your feet. You're coming with me.",""
"115740052-0-20046","Why? Where are you taking me?",""
"115740052-0-20047","To <<1>>, where you'll answer for crimes against the Dominion.",""
"115740052-0-20048","He'll have me killed and served for dinner!",""
"115740052-0-20049","Why would they have us mine? They're soldiers! Shouldn't they be doing the digging?",""
"115740052-0-20050","If they were doing the mining, even more of us would've died, I think.",""
"115740052-0-20051","Shouldn't they have been more ready, though? Or, could they have been?",""
"115740052-0-20052","Only if you're proven guilty. And if you are, none of us could stomach you.",""
"115740052-0-20053","Now, get moving!",""
"115740052-0-20054","Did you see the trolls? They were white! I've never seen a white troll before!",""
"115740052-0-20055","It's a frost troll. I read about them in a book, once. They're from Skyrim.",""
"115740052-0-20056","Y'ffre's bones, what is a troll from Skyrim doing down there?",""
"115740052-0-20057","Good working with you. I'll take her from here. You should inform the king of the good news.",""
"115740052-0-20058","Meet me outside. I need to get out of here.",""
"115740052-0-20059","You, there! We are escaping! Let me open your door.",""
"115740052-0-20060","That's it! Quickly, you must escape before the guards return!",""
"115740052-0-20061","Listen up, you bunch of corset-wearing dog-diddlers! We got a new piece of meat on the rack, fresh from the butcher's block!",""
"115740052-0-20062","Oh good, you're awake! Can you talk?",""
"115740052-0-20063","Hey, you're that drunk from <<1>>. I've never seen a chicken fly so far. You certainly made a fowl play!",""
"115740052-0-20064","I can't drink from the lake water anymore after what you did, drunkard.",""
"115740052-0-20065","Don't toddle off just yet. Might I have a word?",""
"115740052-0-20066","And the Undaunted returns! And from the Vaults of Madness themselves! Hope it was worth it—defeating the Mad Architect couldn't have been an easy feat.",""
"115740052-0-20067","Blasted Xarxes, I know I shouldn't have … oh. Another one?",""
"115740052-0-20068","Another petitioner, so soon after the other! If it would hold still, I could capture its likeness.",""
"115740052-0-20070","No! By rights, I should be the one to take the blade. I'm the one who failed.",""
"115740052-0-20071","Nyronie, no. This person has already offered to help us.",""
"115740052-0-20072","The sacrifice should come from the Wyrd, and I'm the one responsible.",""
"115740052-0-20073","Linnae, she's right. The heart of a stranger compared to a self-sacrifice? Hircine is bound to hear and answer.",""
"115740052-0-20074","But we need three for the ritual. She can't do it!",""
"115740052-0-20075","The outsider can do it. Only two of us are required for the prayers.",""
"115740052-0-20076","I won't allow it.",""
"115740052-0-20077","You've no choice. Do you want this to succeed or fail? Nyronie is ready and willing. You know we're right.",""
"115740052-0-20078","The Abbey of Blades will rise from these ashes. If I survive the dark path we must walk, I will return to help Kasura shape a new generation of blademasters.",""
"115740052-0-20079","A noble goal, Sai. Perhaps I'll join you. For now, we should see to the survivors.",""
"115740052-0-20080","The damage is great, but if you had not arrived when you did, there would be nothing left to rebuild. Be safe in the coming days, my friends. I look forward to your return.",""
"115740052-0-20081","You continue to surprise me, Sahan. And just when I thought I had you figured out.",""
"115740052-0-20082","You can never know me, Tharn. In the Book of Circles, Divad wrote that the greatest of warriors suffers his pain in silence, for he knows that an open oven bakes no bread.",""
"115740052-0-20083","My great grandfather Knavus Tharn put it another way: better to keep your silence and be thought an imbecile, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt!",""
"115740052-0-20084","No! I won't let you interrupt my research! I will bring her back!",""
"115740052-0-20085","Meet us in Riften's Inn.",""
"115740052-0-20086","I have no time to deal with these fools. Kill them. Kill them all!",""
"115740052-0-20087","There. That should keep them out. Shornhelm will be safe now.",""
"115740052-0-20088","If you hurt my sister, I'll kill you myself!",""
"115740052-0-20089","Where's my sister? Where is she?",""
"115740052-0-20090","What do you suppose this place was?",""
"115740052-0-20091","A temple of some kind. The Dark Anchors may have pulled it into Coldharbour. Or, perhaps it was created by the Daedra to mock the Divines.",""
"115740052-0-20092","What does it matter? We can't wait any longer. We must perform the ritual. Vestige, it is time for you to make your decision.",""
"115740052-0-20093","Quickly, follow <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-20094","Beyond these cells you'll find the forge. Arm yourself and find Lyris.",""
"115740052-0-20095","The way is clear. <<1>> is leading the others to the forge.",""
"115740052-0-20096","Your generosity is five-clawed, my friend! Listen, everyone. That one bought this one a drink. This calls for a song!",""
"115740052-0-20097","You asked for a drink? Tubidan. You're dead. What a waste of coin!",""
"115740052-0-20098","An enemy approaches. Strike it down!",""
"115740052-0-20099","Sai, are you well enough to continue?",""
"115740052-0-20100","Have no fear, Snow Lily. I am Redguard. We are like mountain bamboo: far stronger and more flexible then we might appear.",""
"115740052-0-20101","I find it hilarious that Mannimarco chose such a massive projected appearance. He's obviously overcompensating for something.",""
"115740052-0-20102","Do not slow, Vestige. With the passing of time, any indecision becomes decision.",""
"115740052-0-20103","Countess, Baron, please. We must remain focused. As long as Montclair controls the upper city, the whole region remains at risk.",""
"115740052-0-20104","Another enemy blocks the path ahead. Dispatch it quickly.",""
"115740052-0-20105","The God of Brutality knows of your escape. Hurry!",""
"115740052-0-20106","We'll never forget you Sire, or your sacrifice.",""
"115740052-0-20107","Snow Lily, no … don't do this. Please.",""
"115740052-0-20108","Sai, I … I'll never forget you. And we'll finish this, I swear it.",""
"115740052-0-20109","You're an idiot, Tubidan.",""
"115740052-0-20110","Silence, both of you! That one bought Khajiit a drink.",""
"115740052-0-20111","So now you're going to sing?",""
"115740052-0-20112","No. Khajiit is most Undaunted here. You will sing.",""
"115740052-0-20113","What? No!",""
"115740052-0-20114","And you will sing, Sahba.",""
"115740052-0-20115","Go play in the Vaults of Madness, Tubidan.",""
"115740052-0-20116","All are staying in this tavern until you sing! So sing, fools!",""
"115740052-0-20117","Great Akatosh, Dragon God of Time, forgive me for my hubris. Grant your divine power to the Vestige and restore your protection to Tamriel, that my sacrifice might not be in vain.",""
"115740052-0-20118","Hey! You! Help me out of this mess.",""
"115740052-0-20119","Position yourself over there, Vestige. And brace yourself.",""
"115740052-0-20120","Up the stairs, quickly! We must get to the anchor mooring!",""
"115740052-0-20121","I do not disagree, Baron, but we need to proceed with caution. There is more to this situation than meets the eye.",""
"115740052-0-20122","I know I make you both nervous. Perhaps we should continue this after our blood has cooled.",""
"115740052-0-20123","Who knows no fear … of beast or blade?",""
"115740052-0-20124","Who knows no fear … of Daedric planes?",""
"115740052-0-20125","Yes. Yes!",""
"115740052-0-20126","Who knows no fear … of death? Of age?",""
"115740052-0-20127","We are Undaunted!",""
"115740052-0-20128","Undaunted! Undaunted!",""

"115740052-0-20135","How uncharacteristically optimistic of you, Titanborn. I may have that embroidered on a pillow.",""
"115740052-0-20136","That's the stuff!",""
"115740052-0-20137","The Divines gave you a nose for a reason, Tharn. So you can keep your mouth shut and still keep breathing.",""

"115740052-0-20153","Is that why you reek? What is that smell?",""
"115740052-0-20154","The harpies! They're here! The scent lure on these two brought the whole flock down on us!",""
"115740052-0-20155","We need to wash this stuff off before the harpies get us! To the pond!",""
"115740052-0-20156","Please, go with them. The villagers and I will hide from the beasts.",""
"115740052-0-20158","The poor girl. May these flames purify her spirit.",""

"115740052-0-20178","Molag Bal said you would not come.",""

"115740052-0-20185","Of course, my child. Now, let's clear away our meal and welcome our friend. Kallin, as always, I thank you for sharing your life's blood with us.",""
"115740052-0-20186","According to the contract, you were to complete the project without additional help.",""
"115740052-0-20187","What? Maybe we didn't work in a conventional way, but we got rid of the harpies.",""

"115740052-0-20205","Believe it or not, I think we solved their harpy problem! Nice work! Let's get back to the village and check in with the elder.",""

"115740052-0-20207","The little one gets no dessert this evening. Adusa will make sure.",""
"115740052-0-20208","To understand the path that Montclair follows, you must understand how he came to walk upon it. I believe the key to stopping him hides within my own memories.",""
"115740052-0-20209","Memories are elusive shadows, hiding truths behind our own perceptions. But what if someone else could examine them? What would they see that we do not?",""
"115740052-0-20210","I'd like to try something, if you're willing. This potion will allow you to dream-walk through my memories. Perhaps your eyes will see what I have missed.",""
"115740052-0-20211","Ah, Sai Sahan and company, at last! You've played into my trap nicely.",""
"115740052-0-20212","Well, I am staying here.",""
"115740052-0-20213","Look at this! You think that's the skull of King Ranser? Maybe he was decapitated!",""
"115740052-0-20214","Why will you not listen? Beef-witted beast! Must I tie a torch to your tail again to teach you?",""
"115740052-0-20215","Your friend has vouched for your good work. Though your methods were unconventional, you greatly thinned the harpy flock.",""
"115740052-0-20216","All in a day's work. We're glad we could help!",""
"115740052-0-20217","Here's the agreed-upon payment. Stories of your heroic deeds will be told to all those that pass through our camp.",""
"115740052-0-20218","Thank you. Our business is all word of mouth, so that'll be a huge help. And thank you, friend! We won't forget your support, either.",""
"115740052-0-20219","Fadeel … what are you doing? Wait! No! Come back here you stupid beast!",""
"115740052-0-20220","There's trouble in Crestshade, but I'm not sure I'll find a safe haven at that place up there.",""
"115740052-0-20221","I think I'll rest here for a moment before making my way to Shornhelm.",""
"115740052-0-20222","Initiate. Kneel in the black pool and submit yourself to me.",""
"115740052-0-20223","I must say, it's rather strange seeing you as … me.",""
"115740052-0-20224","Mother … please. You have to take the medicine. Reezal-Jul can help you!",""
"115740052-0-20225","Oh, sweet daughter, I can't go on like this. I don't want to spend my final days as an experiment. Instead, let me spend them with the ones I love.",""
"115740052-0-20226","Even in retrospect, reliving this is difficult. Her pain, her suffering. She had so much courage.",""
"115740052-0-20227","There has to be something more we can do. Verandis, can I talk to you for a moment?",""
"115740052-0-20228","As you wish, m'lady.",""
"115740052-0-20229","Hey, over here. Just a moment, before you go inside ….",""
"115740052-0-20230","It's only a trap if you don't know about it. I assume everything is a trap. Therefore, it's a challenge.",""
"115740052-0-20231","What do you think? Trap?",""
"115740052-0-20232","Something's wrong. I have vague recollections of talking to someone else, but why can't I remember? You need to look around, see what we missed ….",""
"115740052-0-20233","You've seen the truth. Now help me find peace. Take my skull and reunite it with my bones. We can end this curse.",""
"115740052-0-20234","She seems to be drawing power from those stones. Destroy them, quickly!",""
"115740052-0-20235","Time to feast!",""
"115740052-0-20236","Vestige! Hold a moment!",""
"115740052-0-20237","I shall begin my research at once. Try to determine where Reezal-Jul has gone. In the meantime, you should seek out the High King.",""
"115740052-0-20238","I am whole again! Meet me where I slayed the mad king. Perhaps I can finally end this horrid existence.",""
"115740052-0-20239","Without your help, my friend, I would never have recalled that Reezal-Jul led us to the Ayleid relic. What else have I forgotten, I wonder?",""
"115740052-0-20240","Three cheers for Verandis! He gave me the means to save my beautiful wife!",""
"115740052-0-20242","Ranser! You madman! It's time to finish this!",""
"115740052-0-20243","Yes, to our dear friend, Verandis! How can we ever repay him?",""
"115740052-0-20244","He is great, isn't he? And so handsome! But I want to cheer about this wine. By the Divines, this stuff is delicious!",""
"115740052-0-20245","We were so happy at this moment. We were all together, friends and family, enjoying each other's company. For the final time ….",""
"115740052-0-20246","Verandis, may I speak to you for a moment? Alone.",""
"115740052-0-20247","I … I don't recall speaking with Leila. Why can't I remember that?",""
"115740052-0-20248","You know, that Varen fellow was always a good chap, even if he did muck things up at the start. And he did put things right in the end, didn't he?",""
"115740052-0-20249","He's still with you, you know. A part of you, really. And perhaps he can continue to serve the land and the people he gave his life to save, through you.nnThat's all well and done, then. There's just one bit of business left.",""
"115740052-0-20250","Ah, fair Lyris. She will be missed. Her light may have left this world, but her spirit lives on in you … perhaps even in a literal sense. Take comfort in that.",""
"115740052-0-20251","When I was a priestess of Arkay, Molag Bal ravaged me and left me for dead. A group of nomads tried to purify me with fire. But I awoke … changed.",""
"115740052-0-20252","And she did give her life to save this world, didn't she? Though I can't understand why you're all so fond of it. Dreadful place. Ah well, it's horses for courses, I suppose.nnThat's all well and done, then. There's just one bit of business left.",""
"115740052-0-20254","When I saw what I had done, I called out to my god, Arkay. I prayed that he would rid me of Molag Bal's curse. But Arkay did not answer.",""
"115740052-0-20255","I don't know that this world will ever see the like of Sai Sahan again. He was the embodiment of loyalty and discipline—qualities that he tried to share, not by word, but by deed.nnYou can make use of that. He's part of you now, you know.",""
"115740052-0-20256","Our noble Redguard friend may have shuffled off this mortal coil, but his spirit will live on, through you.nnThat's all well and done, then. There's just one bit of business left.",""
"115740052-0-20257","A real chasm or another illusion? We probably shouldn't chance it. See if you can locate another tear.",""
"115740052-0-20258","The stone reacts differently to you, Count. How remarkable.",""
"115740052-0-20259","We shouldn't have left the guards behind, Wylon. Who knows what else we're going to run into?",""
"115740052-0-20260","There was no choice, Mother. You're getting worse and we can't wait for them.",""
"115740052-0-20261","I'll stay here and protect the way out. Keep watch in case the guards catch up with us. The rest of you need to keep moving.",""
"115740052-0-20262","Thank you, Gwendis. At least you retain a sense of honor.",""
"115740052-0-20263","Wylon, you have to stop blaming Verandis. This wasn't his fault.",""
"115740052-0-20264","I am a married woman, so you must starve. Unless you care to feast upon yourself.",""
"115740052-0-20265","Most appreciated, my hairless friend. Look for me at Ravenwatch Manor, when you have completed the task.",""
"115740052-0-20266","Verandis, we need you! We need your power! Quickly! Touch the relic and help us!",""
"115740052-0-20267","Father … what … what's happening to us?",""
"115740052-0-20268","Please, Verandis. Help me! Make it stop! I … I can't stand the pain.",""
"115740052-0-20269","<<1>>'s soldiers were no match for the inner vault. Step carefully.",""
"115740052-0-20270","No! Verandis! What did you do to Leila? What did you do?",""
"115740052-0-20271","You'll pay for that, vampire! I have the power now. Nothing can stop me from reaching out and snapping ….",""
"115740052-0-20272","Verandis? Montclair, no! Come on, Verandis, we need to get out of here!",""
"115740052-0-20273","Now we know why the Falinesti Faithful were forced to dig. We should speak of this.",""
"115740052-0-20274","This way. With the veil torn I can see a way up over there.",""
"115740052-0-20275","Help! Oh, help me! Get me out of here!",""
"115740052-0-20276","Oh, dear. I suppose I'll have to find a way to undo this.",""
"115740052-0-20277","Come on! Mother doesn't have much time left.",""
"115740052-0-20278","Ayleid skeletons, undead spirits—it doesn't matter. Nothing is going to stand in our way!",""
"115740052-0-20279","End this, Verandis. End this before I … arrgh!",""
"115740052-0-20280","No one should ever have to go through this pain. My poor wife … my Leila.",""
"115740052-0-20281","If you're looking for calipers, you won't find any in there.",""
"115740052-0-20282","Yes m'lady. Please try not to get any on my clothes. Blood is murder to get out.",""
"115740052-0-20283","Now just hold still Stibbons ….",""
"115740052-0-20284","If you are looking for money, you sure won't find any here.",""
"115740052-0-20285","Well, I was going to use those for dinner.",""
"115740052-0-20286","Now you, Goblin, drink from the chalice.",""
"115740052-0-20287","My claws and daggers are ready! This one will fight like a whirlwind of fury!",""
"115740052-0-20288","What? What's happening …?",""
"115740052-0-20289","Oh, dear … that was an unexpected side effect.",""
"115740052-0-20290","I think perhaps it's best if you go ahead and close up the shop early today, Lady Mondorie. In fact, why don't you go ahead and do that now.",""
"115740052-0-20291","Yes, Constable Gavendien. I'll close up right away. Just don't do anything … rash.",""
"115740052-0-20292","There is no choice in the matter. The constable says we need your wagon, and your horse.",""
"115740052-0-20293","But … but what will I do? If I can't haul grain, I can't make any coin! My family will starve!",""
"115740052-0-20294","This text is displayed after the conversation ends. The speaker name should be the appearance def.",""
"115740052-0-20295","Hold the troops here until I give the signal. I don't want to risk loyal soldiers or city assets prematurely.",""
"115740052-0-20296","As you command, my lord.",""
"115740052-0-20297","What are you doing in my city, Lleraya?",""
"115740052-0-20298","As you wish, m'lady.",""
"115740052-0-20299","What have you done? My manservant is a Goblin! It'll take me forever to undo this!",""
"115740052-0-20300","Har! Yes … revenge!",""
"115740052-0-20301","You walked into the wrong farm house, Montclair!",""
"115740052-0-20302","I heard what happened to Turenn, and I came as fast as I could.",""
"115740052-0-20303","Gabria! Thank you so much for coming. I need your help.",""
"115740052-0-20304","Don't worry, sir. Turenn planned everything. We've got you set up as a merchant in Orsinium.",""
"115740052-0-20305","That's perfect. As it happens, I have friends there.",""
"115740052-0-20306","Then let us be on our way.",""
"115740052-0-20307","Thank you for your mercy, friend. We won't be seeing each other again.",""
"115740052-0-20308","Heard you'd been trying to make amends, old man. You know what I think?",""
"115740052-0-20309","Over here! I'm hiding. Arkay help me but I loathe skeevers.",""
"115740052-0-20310","Goblins!",""
"115740052-0-20311","Click on the soul hoogies and run to the shrines to charge them!",""

"115740052-0-20313","The hoard approach. Protect us!",""
"115740052-0-20314","The only redemption for a murderous bastard like you is a slow, painful death, and we're going to give it to you!",""

"115740052-0-20316","Get up! You can rot in the stockade for a little while first.",""
"115740052-0-20317","Fair Guendeline, come forth and hear my words of love!",""
"115740052-0-20318","This should be interesting.",""

"115740052-0-20328","And I wonder, did you forget to brush your hair …?",""
"115740052-0-20329","My hair …? How could you embarrass me like this? Go away, Julien. Go away and never come back.",""
"115740052-0-20330","I guess maybe I should've planned that better. What have I done? I've ruined my whole life in two sentences!",""
"115740052-0-20332","Have you forgotten? You do want us to keep your family safe, do you not? I suggest you close your mouth.",""
"115740052-0-20333","I love thee to the depth and breadth and height",""
"115740052-0-20334","Celestial of the Warrior! Akatosh calls you false. Cease your attacks on our people and begone!",""
"115740052-0-20335","We do not fear you. Come, face me in the pit!",""
"115740052-0-20336","Aktasoh is a false god, as are all the Aedra. Craglorn belongs to me!",""
"115740052-0-20337","You are beneath me, priest. But my Yokudans will destroy you!",""
"115740052-0-20338","Destroy these echos of Yokuda, defenders of Craglorn! Protect me!",""
"115740052-0-20339","Lock him up. Make sure to spit in his face every hour, too.",""
"115740052-0-20340","With pleasure. Heh.",""
"115740052-0-20341","The large door straight ahead. Clearly, that's the main entrance. That's the way we should proceed.",""
"115740052-0-20342","This door is closer. It could provide a shorter path. Perhaps fewer bloodfiends to contend with.",""
"115740052-0-20343","I'd rather cut through the enemies I can see than walk blindly into something I can't. The ruins might be full of traps!",""
"115740052-0-20344","My dear Baron, you have an annoying habit of never listening to a word I say. You'll do as you please. As usual.",""
"115740052-0-20345","You! In the attic! I am Alard, Baron of House Dorell, and I swear you will be safe in my hands!",""
"115740052-0-20346","And you as well. But tell me—is Ellic hiding up there?",""
"115740052-0-20347","I'm sorry to say, but no. I left him at your manor. He insisted that he wanted to stay.",""
"115740052-0-20348","These look like signs. The star signs. Must be some sequence to release the barriers. Maybe push the button?",""
"115740052-0-20349","See how the people love me! They even share their life essences with me!",""
"115740052-0-20350","You hate me, don't you? Why does everyone hate me?",""
"115740052-0-20351","Use the spheres against her! Destroy them and take them as your own!",""
"115740052-0-20352","Why do you hate me Verandis? Why can't you love me?",""
"115740052-0-20353","This should never have happened this way. Look how my efforts went astray.",""
"115740052-0-20354","What … what happened?",""
"115740052-0-20355","Ready yourself, Five-Claw! Here they come.",""
"115740052-0-20356","I'll be having a drink at the Dusklight Inn in Hoarfrost Downs. I'll wait for you there.",""
"115740052-0-20357","Magic level is 1/3 full.",""
"115740052-0-20358","Magic level 2/3.",""
"115740052-0-20359","OH MAMA!",""
"115740052-0-20360","People, listen to me. Let's head outside and make sure the rest of the city is secure.",""
"115740052-0-20361","We'll return for the fallen later. Right now the living need us more.",""
"115740052-0-20362","Meet this one outside, my friend. Let's make sure we eliminated all of the assassins.",""
"115740052-0-20363","In the name of High King Emeric and in accordance with the laws of the land, I hearby order the arrest of Ellic Dorell for treason and the death of his kinsmen!",""
"115740052-0-20364","But Father, it wasn't my fault!",""
"115740052-0-20365","You allowed an enemy into our city, into our home! Dozens fell to these monsters because you couldn't ignore a pretty face!",""
"115740052-0-20366","I never meant for anyone to get hurt. I'm not even sure what happened. Lleraya said she wanted to help and I … I'm sorry.",""
"115740052-0-20367","Apologies won't bring our people back. It won't return honor to our family name. Guards! Take Ellic away.",""
"115740052-0-20368","You are dead to me, Ellic. Dead to me.",""
"115740052-0-20369","I'm sorry I disappointed you, Father. It won't happen again.",""
"115740052-0-20370","Arkay protect us! What is that?",""
"115740052-0-20371","Baron Montclair. He's here.",""
"115740052-0-20372","Troops! On my command!",""
"115740052-0-20373","Welcome, Verandis! And like a good guest, I see you've brought me gifts to play with.",""
"115740052-0-20374","Allow me to grant my blessing to your army.",""
"115740052-0-20375","This is exactly what I feared! He's turned our own troops into bloodfiends!",""
"115740052-0-20376","How does it feel to watch those who you care about turn against you, Verandis? How does it feel?",""
"115740052-0-20377","My wife … my daughter … you've taken everything I ever loved, Verandis!",""
"115740052-0-20378","Wylon, I'm sorry. I never meant for any of this to happen.",""
"115740052-0-20379","My daughter loved you, Verandis. She loved you!",""
"115740052-0-20380","The Remnant … the power. It drove Lleraya insane! Are those giant skeletons?",""
"115740052-0-20381","This was just what I needed! You go on ahead. I'll wait here and make sure the way stays clear.",""
"115740052-0-20382","You've grown strong, Verandis. Your allies grant you strength.",""
"115740052-0-20383","Come out and face us, you coward! You can't hide from us forever!",""
"115740052-0-20384","Wylon, please. We can find a way to free you from this power.",""
"115740052-0-20385","To what end, my old friend? My wife is dead. My daughter, killed by your own hand. What do I have, if not this power?",""
"115740052-0-20386","I think I'd prefer to let you experience my pain. My suffering. To let you see what it's like to lose everything you hold dear!",""
"115740052-0-20387","No, Montclair! Stop this madness!",""
"115740052-0-20388","Come, Gwendis. You look famished. Allow me to prepare you a feast fit for my new queen!",""
"115740052-0-20389","No, Montclair! Please!",""
"115740052-0-20390","Destroy those ogrim! You must not let them reach me!",""
"115740052-0-20391","The Atronaches! Destroy them, or I'll be ripped apart!",""
"115740052-0-20392","The way is open.",""
"115740052-0-20393","I will avenge this humiliation. You fools have not heard the last of me!",""
"115740052-0-20394","We have defeated the Celestial, brave warriors! Akatosh has proven stronger than the pretender god!",""
"115740052-0-20395","Celebrate this victory and enjoy your spoils, heroes of Craglorn!",""
"115740052-0-20396","Ha ha ha ha ha! The meager power of Akatosh is no protection from my will. Look upon me, ye mortals, and despair!",""
"115740052-0-20397","What a strange chamber. Look at the tiles on the floor. I wonder if this is an Ayleid device to operate the barriers?",""
"115740052-0-20398","Hmmm, look at these tiles. This seems to be some sort of puzzle.",""
"115740052-0-20399","Do not test me again, or you will suffer for it. Minions! To me!",""
"115740052-0-20400","I'm sorry, sir. I tried, but no one here is willing to enlist.",""
"115740052-0-20401","Unacceptable, Captain. Either deliver me recruits or deliver me your resignation.",""
"115740052-0-20402","Quiet as the grave. Wherever they are, they're not here.",""
"115740052-0-20403","Dulkhi was causing her worry? The servant? My word! We should search her quarters. Perhaps something there will hint at what happened.",""
"115740052-0-20404","There! Stendarr's mercy, let her have left some clue.",""
"115740052-0-20405","What? But that was our spot! She … and they … and the Baroness! What could she possibly be hiding out there?",""
"115740052-0-20406","When we were children, Arlie and I came here to get away from the world. What I wouldn't give to have her with us now.",""
"115740052-0-20407","That's the key to the Undercroft. That must have been what the Baroness hid here! But why? We should investigate.",""
"115740052-0-20408","Arlie told her mother? Then it's true. It's all true.",""
"115740052-0-20409","The Undercroft. Steel yourself, we don't know what's down there.",""
"115740052-0-20410","Arlie's mother did this? She summoned a Daedric prince to … to …. But why?",""
"115740052-0-20411","Stendarr's mercy!",""
"115740052-0-20412","Never fear, the amazing Darien is here!",""
"115740052-0-20413","Another battle, another victory. Go on ahead. I'll stay here and guard the door.",""
"115740052-0-20414","Look! Something's happening! Can you see them? The Ayleid spirits? Watch which tiles they go to.",""
"115740052-0-20415","Each tile is marked with a constellation! Perhaps if we repeat the actions of the spirits, we can open the barrier that blocks our way.",""
"115740052-0-20416","You did it! The barrier has disappeared! We can move on and try to find the portal chamber now.",""
"115740052-0-20417","We've nearly made it, but there is another ward and an odd statue that seems to be guarding it.",""
"115740052-0-20418","What is that? Are you seeing this?",""
"115740052-0-20419","That did it!",""
"115740052-0-20420","Be on your guard. Montclair will do everything he can to stop us.",""
"115740052-0-20421","If Gwendis has been harmed, or any of our friends …. I'll show him no mercy.",""
"115740052-0-20422","We're close. I can sense that Gwendis is nearby.",""
"115740052-0-20423","Arlie!",""
"115740052-0-20424","Please don't tell Arlie this, but her mother's responsible for bringing us here. She may not be happy to see us.",""
"115740052-0-20425","Get off your arses, boys. Go take down those traps. We don't need them anymore.",""
"115740052-0-20426","But Bumnog! We just finished setting them up!",""
"115740052-0-20427","I get to take down the pots. It's your turn to get caught up in those nets.",""
"115740052-0-20428","Go on. The second portal chamber should be on the third level. I want to make sure this portal is stable and then I'll follow after you.",""
"115740052-0-20429","Another mortal come to play?",""
"115740052-0-20430","Well now, I've broken a sweat! I've not had this much fun in ages!",""
"115740052-0-20431","Please, I don't want to die!",""
"115740052-0-20432","Hey! Over here! Help! Please!",""
"115740052-0-20433","This lava goes on as far as I can see. How can anything live in this place?",""
"115740052-0-20434","There it is. That's where they keep the <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-20435","Good luck. I'm not going with you.",""
"115740052-0-20436","Funny. She's not as scary now.",""
"115740052-0-20437","Another barrier blocks our way. Look around and see if you can find a way to disable it.",""
"115740052-0-20438","Gwendis? What has he done to you?",""
"115740052-0-20439","Verandis … help. Please, help me. Their blood … smells so good! These restraints. They won't hold me back much longer.",""
"115740052-0-20440","You must control yourself, Gwendis. We'll find a way to get you out of there.",""
"115740052-0-20441","Show yourself, Wylon! Tell me what you want!",""
"115740052-0-20442","You did it! You were able to widen the tear so that we can see the path ahead as it truly is.",""
"115740052-0-20443","The way ahead appears blocked, but I'm sure it's another illusion.",""
"115740052-0-20444","Well done, my friend! I'll meet you on the other side.",""
"115740052-0-20445","I'm sorry, they forced me to do it! I had no choice!",""
"115740052-0-20446","Larelleis? The time of sweet water? That must refer to spring rains.",""
"115740052-0-20447","Quickly. Bring the shards to the shrines.",""
"115740052-0-20448","The green shine? That's close but not quite right. I'm guessing this refers to summer.",""
"115740052-0-20449","Morilatta? The dark light? Dusk? I think this one is referring to autumn.",""
"115740052-0-20450","Anga? That could mean iron. Or cold. I suppose this one refers to winter.",""
"115740052-0-20451","The titans have descended!",""
"115740052-0-20452","Excellent. Let's step outside. Lead on!",""
"115740052-0-20453","Damn you, Montclair! Answer me! I'm sorry, my friend, but it seems we're going to have to play Montclair's game to free the others.",""
"115740052-0-20454","The statues! Their magic is too strong! Use the gargoyles to help you destroy them!",""
"115740052-0-20455","Hold on just a while longer, Gwendis. We're going to get you out of there.",""
"115740052-0-20456","The power is dropping!",""
"115740052-0-20457","Gwendis, are you all right?",""
"115740052-0-20458","I … I did it. I resisted! I didn't feed. Wait, what happened to the nobles? Did … did I remember wrong?",""
"115740052-0-20459","They're fine. Merely unconscious. I'm proud of your restraint, Gwendis.",""
"115740052-0-20460","What's going on in here? Is the Countess all right?",""
"115740052-0-20461","Damn it, Darien! Slow down! Wait for me, you long-legged bastard.",""
"115740052-0-20462","The Baron and the Countess are fine. But you both arrived just in time to move them to safety.",""
"115740052-0-20463","Take them out? But we just got here. We want to help take down Montclair! Neither of us has had a good fight in … well, it's been at least a couple of minutes.",""
"115740052-0-20464","No, Darien. This battle is not one that you and Skordo can win. Leave Montclair to us.",""
"115740052-0-20465","But … but … oh, very well! But I get to help take down the next would-be world conquerer we come across. Deal?",""
"115740052-0-20466","As you wish, brave Darien, as you wish. And now, my friend, the time has come to face Montclair.",""
"115740052-0-20467","Let's get moving. Arlie … be safe.",""
"115740052-0-20468","I feel like I'm living every mage's dream. I'm working with the Arch Mage Shalidor, the Legend from the first era! I just wish I felt like I was up to the challenge.",""
"115740052-0-20469","I don't know how I wound up here, working with you and him. This is by far the most unexpected outcome to a book collecting errand I've ever sent an Adept on!",""
"115740052-0-20470","It's all so much, so fast. I don't know if I told you, but I've only been the Master of Inconubla for a short time now. I feel like I'm still settling into my role.",""
"115740052-0-20471","The barrier has fallen! The portal chamber should be just a short way ahead.",""
"115740052-0-20472","You get the portal open. It's time to go into the Doomcrag.",""
"115740052-0-20473","Yes. That. I'd forgotten about that. Let's continue.",""
"115740052-0-20474","I see your point. Every once in a while I manage to remember something from a dusty tome that's of use. Thank you for reminding me.",""
"115740052-0-20475","The Doomcrag waits just beyond this chamber. The Doomcrag and Baron Montclair.",""
"115740052-0-20476","Enemies Coming in 20 seconds.",""
"115740052-0-20477","I hate to admit it, but I think they got to me, the ones that taunted me and pestered me when I was young. I was the one with her nose in a book, just the type of target some cruel children love to hurt.",""
"115740052-0-20478","That's what drew me to this post in the Mages Guild. All those years with books means I'm more comfortable with a tome than I am in the field, or even with others.",""
"115740052-0-20479","Time to regroup. Harder Pulls starting in 45 seconds.",""
"115740052-0-20480","Giant Boss Coming in 30 seconds.",""
"115740052-0-20481","All right, everyone. Let's gather up our injured and get out of here.",""
"115740052-0-20482","Darien's right. There's nothing left for us here. We need to return to the High King and let him know what happened.",""
"115740052-0-20483","YOU WIN! EVENT COMPLETED! COLLECT YOUR MAGIC ROCKS!",""
"115740052-0-20484","You won. See D. Crenshaw for your prize.",""
"115740052-0-20485","Mage, we need a portal. To Shornhelm, if you please.",""
"115740052-0-20486","Of course, Baron. Only take a moment.",""
"115740052-0-20487","Hey … can I talk to you for a moment?",""
"115740052-0-20488","Look, everyone! We've got a survivor!",""
"115740052-0-20489","Time to kick some skeletal arse!",""
"115740052-0-20490","The portal to Shornhelm is open, my lord.",""
"115740052-0-20491","Arlie!",""
"115740052-0-20492","You've meddled in my family's business long enough. It looks like I'll have to kill you myself.",""
"115740052-0-20493","You are a worm and you will die like a worm, you worm!",""
"115740052-0-20494","Arlie, dear, you really must settle something for us.",""
"115740052-0-20495","Tell him.",""
"115740052-0-20496","Tell him what?",""
"115740052-0-20497","That I'm the one you love. It's obvious.",""
"115740052-0-20498","What?",""
"115740052-0-20499","It is not. Surely you love me, Arlie. Tell her!",""
"115740052-0-20500","I … I … oh, please don't make me do this!",""
"115740052-0-20501","Oh! Arlie, we were only having a bit of fun!",""
"115740052-0-20502","You don't really have to choose between us!",""
"115740052-0-20503","Not right away, at any rate.",""
"115740052-0-20504","Federic!",""
"115740052-0-20505","Well, she is going to have to choose, sometime!",""
"115740052-0-20506","Arlie … I know this is sudden, but I'm leaving for <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-20507","What? But why?",""
"115740052-0-20508","I've learned all I can, here. If these last few days have taught me anything, it's that I must learn to stand on my own.",""
"115740052-0-20509","I … I think I understand. But <<1>> … you will always have a place, here.",""
"115740052-0-20510","Thank you.",""
"115740052-0-20511","Baroness … I know you are angry with me, but I have always thought of you as a mother. I will try to do you proud.",""
"115740052-0-20512","<<1>>, I may have … overreacted. Know that I am sorry for what happened. I should have listened to Allan.",""
"115740052-0-20513","Take care of yourselves. I will write when I can.",""
"115740052-0-20514","We'll miss you!",""
"115740052-0-20515","And I, you.",""
"115740052-0-20516","All right, recruits. Fall in! I want to see the prettiest march to Shornhelm in history!",""
"115740052-0-20517","Arlie. Baroness. I'm leaving.",""
"115740052-0-20518","Federic!",""
"115740052-0-20519","But you've just returned!",""
"115740052-0-20520","I know, my love, but please hear me out.",""
"115740052-0-20521","I am a weak man. I have no knowledge of combat or the world.",""
"115740052-0-20522","If this were to happen again. If raiders were to attack, or one of the Covenant's many enemies … there is nothing I could do to stop them!",""
"115740052-0-20523","I will not be a slave to the whims of fate. When I return … if I return … I will be better able to defend us from the many dangers of this world.",""
"115740052-0-20524","Is there nothing I can say to make you stay?",""
"115740052-0-20525","No, my love. I've made up my mind about this.",""
"115740052-0-20526","I have truly no say in the matter?",""
"115740052-0-20527","If something happened to you, I would never forgive myself. So I must go.",""
"115740052-0-20528","Then go.",""
"115740052-0-20529","Take care, my love.",""
"115740052-0-20530","Federic ….",""
"115740052-0-20531","Arlie. Baroness.",""
"115740052-0-20532","<<1>>, what's wrong?",""
"115740052-0-20533","We're … Federic and I ….",""
"115740052-0-20534","We're leaving, Arlie.",""
"115740052-0-20535","Leaving? But where will you go?",""
"115740052-0-20536","To <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-20537","To seek our fortunes!",""
"115740052-0-20538","But Federic, you've only just arrived! And <<1>> ….",""
"115740052-0-20539","It must be done, Arlie. This isn't the place for us. Not for now, anyway.",""
"115740052-0-20540","It's time we made our own way in the world.",""
"115740052-0-20541","But you're just children!",""
"115740052-0-20542","No, Baroness. We aren't. And it's time we acted it.",""
"115740052-0-20543","But that doesn't mean we won't miss you! We'll write!",""
"115740052-0-20544","We will, at that.",""
"115740052-0-20545","Then … if there's no changing your minds, I … I suppose this is goodbye.",""
"115740052-0-20546","Goodbye, Arlie. Baroness.",""
"115740052-0-20547","We'll see you again, some day.",""
"115740052-0-20548","Be careful out there!",""
"115740052-0-20549","I grew up in these rooms. They're just as I left them.",""
"115740052-0-20550","This might be it ….",""
"115740052-0-20551","I know you were only thinking of me, Mother, but I sometimes wonder about your temper.",""
"115740052-0-20552","Is there a pattern?",""
"115740052-0-20553","Dark moons! What was that?",""
"115740052-0-20554","Watch after the new recruit, Aelif. Colors would hate it if we lost another one.",""
"115740052-0-20555","Yes, yes. Aelif will watch the new blood. Hmmph. Resolutes.",""
"115740052-0-20556","All right you lubbers. Time to cast off!",""
"115740052-0-20557","Very well. Attend me. We shall brace this evil together.",""
"115740052-0-20558","Good. You've made it to the first stone and the amulet is working. I don't have much time, so listen carefully.",""
"115740052-0-20559","You have the aetherial power of another of the Warrior's charges. Good.",""
"115740052-0-20560","At last, the amulet contains the aetherial energy of all three of the Warrior's charges.",""
"115740052-0-20561","Face me, initiate. Prove your mettle in the Trial of Fire.",""
"115740052-0-20562","You have bested me and completed the Trial of Fire. Enter Rahni'Za, initiate, and face the remaining trials.",""
"115740052-0-20563","Priests have been imprisoned. You must save them!",""
"115740052-0-20564","The Serpent betrayed us. He poisoned the Warrior's mind and turned him against us.",""
"115740052-0-20565","But my hope is that the aetherial energy from the Mundus stones will allow us to weaken the Serpent's grip on the Warrior.",""
"115740052-0-20566","The Serpent's followers, the Scaled Court, range all across Craglorn. They found the Warrior's Apex Stone.",""
"115740052-0-20567","They weakened the stone with foul magics. I believe that the aetherial power of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed can restore the Warrior's Apex Stone.",""
"115740052-0-20568","Now, hurry. The power of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed can strengthen the Warrior's Apex Stone and weaken the Serpent's hold.",""
"115740052-0-20569","Go to the ruins of Kardala, at the center point from where these stones rest. The Apex Stone lies within.",""
"115740052-0-20570","The ruins of Kardala. Tread carefully. The ancient wards protecting this place may still be active.",""
"115740052-0-20571","The Apex Stone waits beyond this door. The Warrior's charges will guide your way.",""
"115740052-0-20572","The Skystone Amulet is charged with the aetherial power of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed. Use it to cleanse the Apex Stone of the Serpent's corruption.",""
"115740052-0-20573","Thanks!",""
"115740052-0-20574","Listen closely. I can't appear for long or the Enemy will see. Erold means well, but he can't accomplish the task ahead. You must do this.",""
"115740052-0-20575","Who disturbs the Queen of Flame?",""
"115740052-0-20576","The Warrior's Apex Stone lies within. It is crucial that you reach it. I feel the eyes of the Serpent searching for us both.",""
"115740052-0-20577","Enter the circle, friend.",""
"115740052-0-20578","Stars above, let this new light do your will.",""
"115740052-0-20579","Let them always follow where you lead.",""
"115740052-0-20580","And bless them to restore those who have fallen from glory. Our missing guardians.",""
"115740052-0-20581","You have been accepted by the stars above. You are now one of us.",""
"115740052-0-20582","Accept them, oh stars.",""
"115740052-0-20583","Oh, please aid them.",""
"115740052-0-20584","Oh, please bless them.",""
"115740052-0-20585","At last, the Warrior's Apex Stone stands before us. I sense the Serpent's power in this place. I must flee before I am ensnared as well.",""
"115740052-0-20586","Great Warrior, I am your strength. Forsake this madness and return to health!",""
"115740052-0-20587","Great Warrior, I am your mercy. Forsake this madness and remember peace!",""
"115740052-0-20588","Great Warrior, I am your swiftness. Forsake this madness and ride against our enemy!",""
"115740052-0-20589","Activate the Western and Eastern Shrine!",""
"115740052-0-20590","Activate the Temple Altar!",""
"115740052-0-20591","The beast has arrived. To the temple!",""
"115740052-0-20592","You have purged my venom from the Apex Stone. Clever. Too clever for a mortal.",""
"115740052-0-20593","She helped you, didn't she? I can smell her fear upon you. No matter. I will find her and consume her in time, just as I have her fellow guardians.",""
"115740052-0-20594","Do not think you have succeeded here. The damage remains. The Warrior has fallen from the sky and is trapped in mortal form. He is mine.",""
"115740052-0-20595","This path belongs to Ysmir the Forefather. Those who are not one of us … must be destroyed!",""
"115740052-0-20596","The arena is the true test of strength! All others are pretenders!",""
"115740052-0-20597","You think to defeat an army of legend? Fools.",""
"115740052-0-20598","Titans!",""
"115740052-0-20599","Really? Then why is Vigrod here? Shouldn't he be at the Hall?",""
"115740052-0-20600","Lord of Domination!",""
"115740052-0-20601","I'm getting back to the mead hall. Come visit if you find the rest of us.",""
"115740052-0-20602","Did that work?",""
"115740052-0-20603","I'm sick of this island, Kaleen. I should be in Betnikh, visiting my people.",""
"115740052-0-20604","Think, Lambur. How will we get there without a crew?",""
"115740052-0-20605","Finally, home to Betnikh! I've missed my clan.",""
"115740052-0-20606","Well then, my dear friend. It's time we try and find some help to continue our research!",""
"115740052-0-20607","To all adventurers of Dragonstar, I seek protection on a most important mission! There will be gold for those who wish to partake.",""
"115740052-0-20608","Help us.",""
"115740052-0-20609","I want to examine the various guardian stones that have become tainted as of late. There has to be some connection with the rebirth of the Yokudan and the corruption we've seen.",""
"115740052-0-20610","There's got to be a connection somewhere. I wish to transcribe any energy readings that the sights are giving off. I'll need you to watch over me while I do this.",""
"115740052-0-20611","Stay close!",""
"115740052-0-20612","Hold on … something's coming!",""
"115740052-0-20613","Whatever's going on, even the wildlife is going crazy.",""
"115740052-0-20614","This is the place. I'll just want to set up some glyphs on either side of this to be able to analyze what's going on here.",""
"115740052-0-20615","Seriously? Get ready, we got more company!",""
"115740052-0-20616","These things don't want us getting any where near their little shrine, do they?",""
"115740052-0-20617","There's my brave warrior. As bare-footed as the day I met him! Do you remember anything from last night?",""
"115740052-0-20618","There you are, my sweet! I battled a Hagraven last night. Or was it a mudcrab?",""
"115740052-0-20619","Yes, dear. Of course, dear. And what did I tell you about wearing shoes? You promised you'd put them on whenever you left the lighthouse.",""
"115740052-0-20620","Stop the titans from destroying the shrines.",""
"115740052-0-20621","Go where the light leads you, my friend, but I must stay here. I'll await your return.",""
"115740052-0-20622","The light protect us!",""
"115740052-0-20623","Hear, hear!",""
"115740052-0-20624","Hear, hear!",""
"115740052-0-20625","Puddles! Oh, welcome back you little ball of love!",""
"115740052-0-20626","Puddles, you make me worry so. You can be such a bad guar sometimes.",""
"115740052-0-20627","Puddles, no! Bad Puddles! Come back here, you stupid, stupid creature!",""
"115740052-0-20628","Kill the creature. It deserves nothing but our blades.",""
"115740052-0-20629","They've found us! Defend yourselves!",""
"115740052-0-20630","You killed our beautiful Lady Lleraya! I'm going to rip out your throat and make you pay for that!",""
"115740052-0-20631","Quiet! I hear something. It's probably that blademaster and his guards!",""
"115740052-0-20632","Now look what you did! Your constant blabbering led them right to us!",""
"115740052-0-20633","Lleraya, you fool! Now less complaining and more killing! We'll deal with your attitude later.",""
"115740052-0-20634","How is this my fault? And who died and left you in charge?",""
"115740052-0-20635","The pile of bodies is high enough. Burn them all!",""
"115740052-0-20636","How much gold did you take from my daughter's dowry? How full are your pockets, you snake?",""
"115740052-0-20637","Stop! I yield. I admit defeat. I can't believe you beat me.",""
"115740052-0-20638","You know nothing of the Three! ALMSIVI can't save you now!",""
"115740052-0-20639","Come! I must speak with you once more.",""
"115740052-0-20640","Grab something to defend yourself. Don't be greedy, we have a lot of prisoners to arm.",""
"115740052-0-20641","The Hound is my true consort! You will not interfere!",""
"115740052-0-20642","Wait! You can't start without this!",""
"115740052-0-20643","I'm going to be fine, father. Thanks to this traveler. Can we get me off of this rock now?",""
"115740052-0-20644","There you are! It's about time you got here.",""
"115740052-0-20645","I will start the ritual. No doubt the Anka-Ra and their guardians will try to stop me. Be ready.",""
"115740052-0-20646","Hey, you're going the wrong way!",""
"115740052-0-20647","Fine. Go ahead and leave. I'll do this myself!",""
"115740052-0-20648","I'm sure glad to see you! I was lost without you.",""
"115740052-0-20649","By the Three, this place smells terrible!",""
"115740052-0-20650","You look so pale. No wonder my brother wouldn't let me come by to visit.",""
"115740052-0-20651","Don't worry about me. I'll be back on my feet in no time. But what about you? Your brother said that neither of you had taken the curative yet.",""
"115740052-0-20652","Uncle, I'm not sure about these Maulborn. And their curative sounds too good to be true. But don't worry about me. Just take care of yourself.",""
"115740052-0-20653","Uncle! Are you all right?",""
"115740052-0-20654","That's mine!",""
"115740052-0-20655","Grell? Grell, are you in here?",""
"115740052-0-20656","What do you think you're…",""
"115740052-0-20657","By the Tribunal! Grell!",""
"115740052-0-20658","Poor Grell. What in Oblivion's name happened to him? Let's get out of here.",""
"115740052-0-20659","Grell, please! We're your friends!",""
"115740052-0-20660","Aaaaa!",""
"115740052-0-20661","You, peasant! You think yourself clever. Did the filthy cat give you that little bauble? Or did Ayrenn herself get her hands dirty?",""
"115740052-0-20662","Did she really think she could sail home, and we'd all bend a knee? As she invites mongrels and beasts to cavort in our cities? Deluded fool!",""
"115740052-0-20663","No matter. With Mehrunes Dagon's aid, I will dispose of the false queen and rise as true leader to our people! I am the Veiled Queen!",""
"115740052-0-20664","And as this story ends, a more joyful one begins.",""
"115740052-0-20665","Take your rightful place in our celebration!",""
"115740052-0-20666","I've said enough—go and be merry!",""
"115740052-0-20667","And good riddance to that. Gwaering, are you hurt?",""
"115740052-0-20668","I'll be fine. Let's not delay the ceremony any longer.",""
"115740052-0-20669","Look over there. That's one of the Maulborn. One of the husks must have gotten him.",""
"115740052-0-20670","These … things … are making it very hard to concentrate.",""
"115740052-0-20671","You must defend me if we hope to finish this ritual!",""
"115740052-0-20672","I don't know if I can keep this up much longer!",""
"115740052-0-20673","By the Three, this place chills me to the bones. Let's see if we can find my brother and then get out of here.",""
"115740052-0-20674","Thank the Tribunal you're back. I tried to go deeper into the crypts, but couldn't without you.",""
"115740052-0-20675","Poor thing. I don't have the heart to tell her that the curative might not work.",""
"115740052-0-20676","All right, then. Now I feel icky all over.",""
"115740052-0-20677","Those nix fleas promised they would help. They promised they had a cure!",""
"115740052-0-20678","I don't think we can help these people. The affliction has progressed too far.",""
"115740052-0-20679","By the Three! I fear the plague consumes you, brother!",""
"115740052-0-20680","Aerona, what are you doing here? It's not safe!",""
"115740052-0-20681","The Maulborn attacked us, and the afflicted are turning into plague husks. Oh, Dethisam, this is dreadful!",""
"115740052-0-20682","Don't worry about me. You need to deal with these charlatans. They forced me to drink their curative and now the plague rages within me.",""
"115740052-0-20683","Dethisam, this is dreadful. The Maulborn—how can they be this heartless and duplicitous?",""
"115740052-0-20684","But brother, why are they doing this? I can't see the profit in pretending to have a cure for a plague you're helping to spread.",""
"115740052-0-20685","The Maulborn are spreading the plague. For some reason, they want everyone to become afflicted. They're not healers—they're monsters!",""
"115740052-0-20686","The leader of these Maulborn, Nostrum Breva, has been conducting experiments in the nearby chambers. Maybe something in there will shed light upon what they're hoping to accomplish.",""
"115740052-0-20687","I'll stay here with my brother. Can you look around the other chambers?",""
"115740052-0-20688","Don't do this, Dethisam. The Serk needs you. I need you.",""
"115740052-0-20689","Oh, little sister. The Serk will be fine. And so will you.",""
"115740052-0-20690","You're being selfish, Dethisam. Just like father.",""
"115740052-0-20691","Father promised not to leave us until we were strong enough to go on without him. I know you're strong enough to go on without me.",""
"115740052-0-20692","Damn you, brother! I'm going to miss you. But I'll do as you ask. And you. Meet me outside after you're dealt with these Maulborn bastards.",""
"115740052-0-20693","Thank you for letting me end this my way. Aerona will be fine. Now, let me do this before I turn into a damn monster.",""
"115740052-0-20694","Dethisam, you s'wit! We're not leaving without you.",""
"115740052-0-20695","I hope you know what you're doing. I could become a plague husk at any moment.",""
"115740052-0-20696","My decision is final. Besides, you're sick and your judgment can't be trusted. I'll get us out of here while our friend deals with the Maulborn.",""
"115740052-0-20697","Children of the forest, these grounds are forbidden to you. I warn you again. Leave now, or suffer the consequences!",""
"115740052-0-20698","We'll defend our new home to the death! Come back here you stony bastard!",""
"115740052-0-20699","An outsider!",""
"115740052-0-20700","Can you believe that Treethane?",""
"115740052-0-20701","Thanks for your help. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some alchemical wizardry to perform.",""
"115740052-0-20702","Very well, but my directives will make this difficult.",""
"115740052-0-20703","Go. Convince your people to leave. It is your only choice.",""
"115740052-0-20704","You shouldn't have done this. I guarantee the clan will want to fight.",""
"115740052-0-20705","Friend! Wait up, we need your help!",""
"115740052-0-20706","Nilyne, please! You have to help him. Is he going to be all right?",""
"115740052-0-20707","Have a little patience, Aeron. Dethisam is strong and Nilyne knows what she's doing. He'll be fighting off Lady Hlaalu again in no time!",""
"115740052-0-20708","Quiet, please. I need to concentrate.",""
"115740052-0-20709","Orcs! Orcs are attacking the village!",""
"115740052-0-20710","There aren't any holes this way. I'm turning back.",""
"115740052-0-20711","That should slow them down. Quickly, we should get to the Clan Holdfast!",""
"115740052-0-20712","We come together once more to choose the next caretaker.",""
"115740052-0-20713","The Wilderking entrusted the Fading Tree to us, and this is part of our oath.",""
"115740052-0-20714","My time as caretaker nears its end, and the Fading Tree will choose my successor.",""
"115740052-0-20715","The Fading Tree chooses Erunor! Erunor, you will be our next caretaker!",""
"115740052-0-20716","Me? The tree picked me? I'm honored! I'll do my best!",""
"115740052-0-20717","All right, we're done here. Pack everything up. We need to regroup with the other Maulborn cadres and deliver this plague to the rest of Deshaan!",""
"115740052-0-20718","The arena is open to challengers! Let the melee begin!",""
"115740052-0-20719","If you wish to begin the trial, you merely need speak to me. You will only get one chance at this.",""
"115740052-0-20720","Ready yourselves. The arena is a test of preparation and endurance.",""
"115740052-0-20721","The clan voted to stay … and kill the one who betrayed us!",""
"115740052-0-20722","You have passed the second trial, the trial of blood.",""
"115740052-0-20723","Our friend has done well. I'm not sure this will cure the plague, but it should at least slow down its progress.",""
"115740052-0-20724","All right, that's it. Visiting time is over. Everyone out and let my patient rest.",""
"115740052-0-20725","You heard the lady. Let's go wait outside.",""
"115740052-0-20726","Please, Mother Morrowind! Please help Dethisam get well!",""
"115740052-0-20727","Please, Mother Morrowind! Please help Uncle get well!",""
"115740052-0-20728","Nilyne knows what she's doing. Dethisam will be fine. You'll see.",""
"115740052-0-20729","Come, Erunor. We have much to discuss.",""
"115740052-0-20730","Test your knowledge of the art of the blade against me, if you would continue to the trial below.",""
"115740052-0-20731","Go into the darkness and may your faith guide your path.",""
"115740052-0-20732","I'm happy to say that the suppressant works. It's not a cure, but it should buy me the time I need to find a way to beat the plague.",""
"115740052-0-20733","That's wonderful news! If I wasn't worried about spreading the plague, I'd kiss you right on the lips!",""
"115740052-0-20734","Those bastards! Kill them all!",""
"115740052-0-20735","Strike us down, but the Veiled Heritance will always rise again!",""
"115740052-0-20736","Erunor! Cantadir! Oriadess! We're under attack!",""
"115740052-0-20737","What's happening?",""
"115740052-0-20738","We shall bring some, ah, experts to train you. If you pass their tests, you'll never be alone again.",""
"115740052-0-20739","What's this? An initiate with the patience, stamina, and strength to best the arena! Come here and speak to me.",""
"115740052-0-20740","You have bested the trials and defeated Abelazar. You have earned the name of Sword-Disciple, a name I never expected to confer on anyone ever again.",""
"115740052-0-20741","The books were always intended to be about cooperation. You cannot truly learn to master the art of the blade without the help of others. Abelazar charmed us all and made us complicit in our own destruction.",""
"115740052-0-20742","I will protect the Wilderking as long as I can, but you must hurry.",""
"115740052-0-20743","A remarkable achievement, to see what is beyond seeing. A test of the Sword-Disciple's faith. If only I had seen more clearly the snake that was among us.",""
"115740052-0-20744","Let us speak. I can explain what is happening here.",""
"115740052-0-20745","Quick! We must defend the village!",""
"115740052-0-20746","I carry the guiding flame. Take me to the braziers so I may light the way.",""
"115740052-0-20747","Initiate. With this brazier, you have begun the Trial of Fire. With this trial, you will prove that you are worthy to study among the Sword-Disciples.",""
"115740052-0-20749","My blood is not ink. My eyes are my own. My blood is not ink. My eyes are my own.",""
"115740052-0-20750","This is it. The tomb I spoke of. My tomb. A resting place of great honor granted to me by Tarish-Zi himself.",""
"115740052-0-20751","You see, I am not of this time. Centuries ago, I sought to end the reign of the self-proclaimed emperor, Tarish-Zi, by working secretly from within his royal guard.",""
"115740052-0-20752","The presence of this tomb means that I failed in my mission. Witness—my remains beside a royal seal. The seal is what we are seeking. It is one of the keys needed to enter Tarish-Zi's crypt.",""
"115740052-0-20753","The last thing I remember before appearing in this time was the sound of a battle horn. Then I heard the voice of the one you call the Celestial Warrior. Tarish-Zi must have heard the same call. It is why we have appeared in this time.",""
"115740052-0-20754","There are two more seals to recover, two more tombs of the royal guard. The vanity of Tarish-Zi will serve us well. He had scribes record every conquest, every monument. They will have written about the burial places of all his retainers.",""
"115740052-0-20755","In my time, a great library existed in a place called Rahni'Za. If it's still there, the information we need could be inside. Think on what I've told you. If you decide to believe my tale, meet me at the library.",""
"115740052-0-20756","Ah, much better.",""
"115740052-0-20757","Arise, my children! Attack!",""
"115740052-0-20758","The tome should be here somewhere. Tarish-Zi would have wanted everyone to know of his glorious deeds.",""
"115740052-0-20759","Follow the lights up to my shrine. Smite Vaermina's foolish servants as you come.",""
"115740052-0-20760","This was once a glorious shrine, but time and these fools have befouled it. Come. Cleanse the shrine and we shall speak.",""
"115740052-0-20761","Wait, that's it! Let me see that!",""
"115740052-0-20762","Riza and Tahmin … I know you must be mentioned in here. Ah! Here it is. Both were granted personal burial chambers near the falls to the north. I pray the entrances have not been buried.",""
"115740052-0-20763","We should split up to save time. You find Riza and Tahmin's tombs and retrieve their royal seals. I'll go to Tarish-Zi's crypt and scout it out. We need to know what we're facing.",""
"115740052-0-20764","When you have the seals, meet me at the crypt. With luck, we can catch Tarish-Zi unawares.",""
"115740052-0-20765","Good luck! I'll see you soon.",""
"115740052-0-20766","Thank you, mortal. I had my doubts, but it seems the Abbot's faith in you was well-placed. I will watch you more closely from now on.",""
"115740052-0-20767","Ha! Well done, mortal. Well done. I don't think Vaermina will dare trouble us again for some time!",""
"115740052-0-20768","Behold the power of the Worm!",""
"115740052-0-20769","What? No. No! I can't control my body!",""
"115740052-0-20770","These Worm Cult gifts shall restore the Reach!",""
"115740052-0-20771","He has me. Don't mourn my fate. End him!",""
"115740052-0-20772","He killed <<1>>. He'll pay with his blood!",""
"115740052-0-20773","Ah, you made it. Good. And with the seals, too, I see. Then we're ready to proceed.",""
"115740052-0-20774","The ward is magical in nature. As long as we have the three seals within its vicinity, the door should freely open to us.",""
"115740052-0-20775","Follow me, but stay alert.",""
"115740052-0-20776","By the Master's Mace, you shall die!",""
"115740052-0-20777","You can't defeat me. I am a servant of the Scaled Court, herald of the Celestial Serpent! This school belongs to him!",""
"115740052-0-20778","What? The mist? This should not be possible!",""
"115740052-0-20779","I'll meet you back at camp.",""
"115740052-0-20780","Did you think you could escape this fate, false emperor? Even across the aeons, I find you. And my blade is as sharp as ever, praise Akatosh!",""
"115740052-0-20781","Belkarth is as good a place as any to take respite after our victory. I'm sure you have more questions for me. Find me there if you wish to speak. And well fought!",""
"115740052-0-20782","Fate brought us forward together. We all heard the call to battle. Those poor souls you doomed to a cursed existence will be avenged!",""
"115740052-0-20783","Oblivion take you, false emperor! And may scamps gnaw on your bones.",""
"115740052-0-20784","Ah, that'll be sore tomorrow. Let's get away from here before we're seen. I'll try to grab some proper clothes and a weapon. Meet me at the cave known as Buried Sands. There's something I have to retrieve there. I'll explain more when you arrive.",""
"115740052-0-20785","You made it. Good. There's an ancient burial chamber at the rear of this cave—that's where we need to go.",""
"115740052-0-20786","The Anka-Ra. The self-proclaimed emperor Tarish-Zi's personal army. Each warrior pledged eternal loyalty to the emperor. The cursed form they wear is the mark of their servitude.",""
"115740052-0-20787","If the Anka-Ra have risen from beneath the sands, it can only mean that Tarish-Zi has returned as well. They are bound to him, you see. They rise to his call. Once he ruled these lands—he will seek to do so again.",""
"115740052-0-20788","The royal guard gave up their lives when the emperor died, each buried in separate, hidden tombs. With them are the royal seals—the keys to the royal crypt. One such tomb is here. And if I'm right, one of the seals.",""
"115740052-0-20789","Here it is. The entrance to the chamber. Follow me!",""
"115740052-0-20790","You can't stop the Maulborn, you fool! We are the cleansing fire that burns across Morrowind!",""
"115740052-0-20792","The relic you hold is called the Skystone Amulet. It will grant you access to the Warrior's Apex Stone—but it is capable of so much more.",""
"115740052-0-20793","Go to the Mundus stones of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed. These are the Warrior's charges, whom he has sworn to protect.",""
"115740052-0-20794","The Skystone Amulet was designed to capture the aetherial energy of the Mundus stones. You will need that energy for the task ahead. I'm sorry I can't tell you more. I've already stayed too long.",""
"115740052-0-20795","We tampered with powers beyond our understanding, and we paid a dear price. I will not let you make our mistake!",""
"115740052-0-20796","Don't worry, my lord. I'll make sure you get a dose of the curative.",""
"115740052-0-20797","Have any beds become available? My lord is terribly ill and needs to rest.",""
"115740052-0-20798","The situation is the same as it was the last time you inquired. You're welcome to remain here, or feel free to move into the next hall for a hot meal and a cool drink.",""
"115740052-0-20799","My lord, please. You need to rest!",""
"115740052-0-20800","Did you really thank me? Now I know the sickness has gone to your head!",""
"115740052-0-20801","Nonsense! Exercise and fresh air will do me good. But I do appreciate the care you showed me while I was ill.",""
"115740052-0-20802","You. I'm sorry. I was wrong. I tried to stop them .… Watch out. On the balcony. It's Astanya!",""
"115740052-0-20803","Little brother. You're here.",""
"115740052-0-20804","Naemon, then … what have they told you?",""
"115740052-0-20805","Please. I must know.",""
"115740052-0-20806","Little brother … I would have told you myself, if I could.",""
"115740052-0-20807","My Queen. How may I further the Dominion's goals today?",""
"115740052-0-20808","You only call me that when you've done something you regret. Or expect to regret.",""
"115740052-0-20809","When you snatched father's crown for yourself, you never once called me ""little brother."" Did you know that?",""
"115740052-0-20810","I heard you declared my wife a traitor. That you ordered Estre's death. Well? She's gone now, isn't she?",""
"115740052-0-20811","No regrets, dear sister. You did what must be done for the glory of the Dominion. How could there be shame in that?",""
"115740052-0-20812","(Queen Ayrenn sighs)",""
"115740052-0-20813","I heard someone say there's been trouble down at Koeglin Village.",""
"115740052-0-20814","It's probably just gossip. Koeglin Village is a pretty quiet place. Boring even.",""
"115740052-0-20815","I don't know. What if King Fahara'jad sent soldiers there too? Maybe this really is the start of a war.",""
"115740052-0-20816","I'm back, Stibbons. Glad to see you haven't run off anywhere.",""
"115740052-0-20817","No! Why you ruin pretty spikes? Uggz, come kill!",""
"115740052-0-20818","I … am … reborn!",""
"115740052-0-20819","Forgive me. Forgive us all. We are slaves to a vile serpent. Take mercy on us and end our unnatural existence.",""
"115740052-0-20820","I feel the snakes writhing inside my head. Is that what brought me here? No matter. They are hungry—and so am I!",""
"115740052-0-20821","For those who are observant, I award you. A gift from the treasures of Shada's Tear.",""
"115740052-0-20822","You there. Please. Please help us!",""
"115740052-0-20823","Where are you going? Please come back!",""
"115740052-0-20824","It comes for us! It comes for us! It comes for us!",""
"115740052-0-20825","Goodbye Mirilir. I sow these seeds in memory of the life we shared. Even as we fade, may others come here and find the same joy we found in the flowers, and in each other. So may our love be renewed … for all eternity.",""
"115740052-0-20826","I'll make you pay for taking my daughter's life!",""
"115740052-0-20827","Let the power of the Remnant wash over you!",""
"115740052-0-20828","I'll shower the curse of the Remnant across the world…",""
"115740052-0-20829","The Remnant and I are one! Its power flows through me!",""
"115740052-0-20830","I decided you could use my help, after all! And Tzik'nith sends her regards!",""
"115740052-0-20831","They're so beautiful, Hartmin. Do you think they'll last forever?",""
"115740052-0-20832","It's all for us, Mirilir. The forest, the flowers. All of it.",""
"115740052-0-20833","Captain! I bring great news!",""
"115740052-0-20834","I'm afraid you have me mistaken ….",""
"115740052-0-20835","I stare into the world once more.",""
"115740052-0-20836","No one invades Thodundor's land!",""
"115740052-0-20837","Go on if you must, but I'm going to remain here. For now, at least.",""
"115740052-0-20838","Dethisam? My brother, what happened to you?",""
"115740052-0-20839","This is impossible! No one has been near it!",""
"115740052-0-20840","We've never left this room, I swear!",""
"115740052-0-20841","Look, I have this necklace and these rings. They have to be worth something.",""
"115740052-0-20842","Get in line. Half the patricians of Elinhir came to Belkarth to sell their valuables. It must be pretty bad over there.",""
"115740052-0-20843","Pretty bad? The hedge mages have destroyed most of the city!",""
"115740052-0-20844","Well, I can't give you anything for these.",""
"115740052-0-20845","No, listen. My family is well-respected in Stormhaven. I can get you lots of valuables. I just need to get out of Craglorn!",""
"115740052-0-20846","I hear the Gold Coast Trading Company needs caravan guards.",""
"115740052-0-20847","Don't you have any heart at all?",""
"115740052-0-20848","You want to cry me a river? Go ahead. Maybe you can float out of Craglorn.",""
"115740052-0-20849","Did you see that? They attacked us! And for no good reason! Let's find the key and see what the Maulborn are hiding in there.",""
"115740052-0-20850","Hey! What are you idiots doing? Do we look like plague husks to you?",""
"115740052-0-20851","Look! It's just like I told you. The Maulborn are using the back gate. Let's see if one of them has the key.",""
"115740052-0-20852","I've had about enough of this. They can't pay me enough to protect these caravans.",""
"115740052-0-20853","You're telling me. You know what attacked us the other day? Warriors made out of stone! How are you supposed to fight such creatures? We left the carts in the middle of the road and ran.",""
"115740052-0-20854","I think I'll go to Dragonstar. There's an arena up there. Lots of gold for the taking.",""
"115740052-0-20855","Fighting in the arena has got to be safer than guarding the caravans, anyhow.",""
"115740052-0-20856","And what exactly am I supposed to do with a wagon full of goods and no one to buy them, huh?",""
"115740052-0-20857","I don't know. What do you usually do with them?",""
"115740052-0-20858","I have a standing order with those strange warriors at the Rahni'Za Sword School. Someone usually comes to pick it up, but they haven't shown up this month.",""
"115740052-0-20859","I'm going to lose my shirt here. If they don't pick up their order, I don't get paid.",""
"115740052-0-20860","Better find a way to deliver the order yourself.",""
"115740052-0-20861","You mean cart the goods up a road that's crawling with sand warriors and wild creatures? To a school where they lop off the heads of the unworthy? No thank you. I'll just wait here.",""
"115740052-0-20862","Someone's bound to show up eventually.",""
"115740052-0-20863","You'll not leave here alive.",""
"115740052-0-20864","Approach my statue. Speak to me.",""
"115740052-0-20865","I'll do what I can to keep any more rifts from opening. Countess, defend me!",""
"115740052-0-20866","My pleasure, Vanus. Who said the Guilds can't work together?",""
"115740052-0-20868","I can't stay in here, adept. Let us speak some more outside.",""
"115740052-0-20869","Very authentic! A good black eye short of those ale swilling fetchers, but then you have manners, don't you? Careful. It might give you away.",""
"115740052-0-20870","Shada's minions! To my aid!",""
"115740052-0-20871","All I ask … just … make them pay for this …!",""
"115740052-0-20872","I have no fear of death, for the true king is risen!",""
"115740052-0-20873","Even if I fall, Naemon will be my vengeance!",""
"115740052-0-20874","Naemon has the Staff of Magnus! Nothing you can do will stop him!",""
"115740052-0-20875","This is terrible! I heard the Red Rook bandits have completely stopped all trade.",""
"115740052-0-20876","Really? Could mean more work for me, if traveling merchants need guards.",""
"115740052-0-20877","It's easy for you to stay calm. Those merchants could lose a lot of coin … and lives!",""
"115740052-0-20878","Anything interesting happen to you lately?",""
"115740052-0-20879","Saw a mudcrab the other day.",""
"115740052-0-20880","Ugh, so what? Those things are everywhere. Like rats.",""
"115740052-0-20881","This one was three paces wide and eating a guar.",""
"115740052-0-20882","What do you know about the Dark Elf Ashlanders?",""
"115740052-0-20883","Not much. They keep to themselves. I think they worship Daedra.",""
"115740052-0-20884","I heard they don't live in towns because the Dark Elf houses hate them.",""
"115740052-0-20885","Just between us, I heard Ashlanders accuse the Tribunal gods of murder.",""
"115740052-0-20886","One must use fire to forge the blade and destroy their enemies!",""
"115740052-0-20887","To forge a fine weapon, one needs heat!",""
"115740052-0-20888","And finally, one must purge the weapon in the water's frost!",""
"115740052-0-20889","Your Majesty! The undead are massing at Driladan Pass! A lich lord commands them, and he wears the royal crest ….",""
"115740052-0-20890","Naemon, then … I must beg your indulgence … I cannot speak just now.",""
"115740052-0-20891","Please, speak to him at once.",""
"115740052-0-20892","Burn them all! The Master will not suffer invaders!",""
"115740052-0-20893","No! You've hurt mother for the last time!",""
"115740052-0-20894","Sir … sir, I … they took him, sir!",""
"115740052-0-20895","If you are leaving the area, I cannot accompany you. I will return to my tent.",""
"115740052-0-20896","The Yokudans must not find the goblets. I … I have to hide this.",""
"115740052-0-20897","Hah! Did you see that? I thought I was hallucinating the first time. It's like the spirits of this place are trapped in the past.",""
"115740052-0-20898","We must talk. Do not be afraid. I am a friend.",""
"115740052-0-20899","It is done. Shada has unleashed the curse. nnYou must protect this goblet no matter the cost, my dear friend. My time is near, but the Yokudans can no longer win.",""
"115740052-0-20900","What? The Guardians were once living people? Unbelievable.",""
"115740052-0-20901","I will stand my ground for seven eternities, if I must.",""
"115740052-0-20902","Forgive me, Shada. I have turned to necromancy in order to protect the goblet. Have mercy.",""
"115740052-0-20903","Looks like the lovely stone lady here was responsible for all these shambling corpses. An act of desperation to save her city.",""
"115740052-0-20904","If only I had not failed to protect the goblet. Maybe we would not be cursed.",""
"115740052-0-20905","Your curses will not work on us, witch! We … willl … break … free!",""
"115740052-0-20906","You can't hide! We'll kill these weak minions of yours and find you. You will give us the Water of Life!",""
"115740052-0-20907","Ah, good! I found you! Speak with me a moment, if you would.",""
"115740052-0-20908","Fine, be about your business. I shall be in Elden Root, waiting for you!",""
"115740052-0-20909","Fine, be about your business. I shall be in Wayrest, waiting for you!",""
"115740052-0-20910","Fine, be about your business. I shall be in Ebonheart, waiting for you!",""
"115740052-0-20911","The Shehai of a first rank Ansei sank Yokuda. This Warrior's Shehai is beyond first rank.",""

"115740052-0-21125","Now, let the waters of this city flow with strength for its people. Let them drink and drive back the Yokudans. nnRest well, Zal'ik, and know that today you have saved your people from certain destruction.",""
"115740052-0-21126","Finally … this life is over. I can rest now.",""
"115740052-0-21127","If you are to go after Shada, you will need to defeat her maiden below who corrupts the water. I … wish you the best.",""
"115740052-0-21128","Do not worry, my dear Vhasla. This one will find a way to free you from the horrors you face.",""
"115740052-0-21129","Who sent you? It was Nhalan wasn't it? After all these years, he is still a traitor!",""
"115740052-0-21130","You cannot stop me! My strength comes from Shada herself.",""
"115740052-0-21131","I saved our people! The Yokudans would have slaughtered them! I alone had the courage to do what was necessary to save us all!",""
"115740052-0-21132","Give yourself to Shada. It is useless to resist.",""
"115740052-0-21133","So you're saying the water just … cleared up? On its own?",""
"115740052-0-21134","You said wandering adventurers from the surface came down here. What did you send them to do, Sali'ma?",""
"115740052-0-21135","I wondered if some of the corruption originated from the wings on either side. I merely asked them to investigate.",""
"115740052-0-21136","It looks like it worked. Maybe we'll actually find something now.",""
"115740052-0-21137","Murderer! Slaughterer of innocents! These people are under my protection! I alone gave them hope! I alone gave them a future! Leave now and I will spare you. Enter, and your fate will be the same as the Yokudans before you!",""
"115740052-0-21138","You've bound the rest of the monarch atronachs? Good. But I'm afraid there's something more going on. I noticed it when we bound the storm monarch.",""
"115740052-0-21139","How can you know for sure?",""
"115740052-0-21140","The only way to know for sure is to consult the monarch atronachs themselves. nnPlace the Gem of Aetherial Command in the summoning circle.",""
"115740052-0-21141","You are not our master. We do not serve mortal flesh.",""
"115740052-0-21142","Who do you serve?",""
"115740052-0-21143","The Mage. She created us. Imbued us with thought. But she has fallen, corrupted by the Serpent who crawls on his belly.",""
"115740052-0-21144","The waves of the Nerieds will carry you away!",""
"115740052-0-21145","The water will not let you escape!",""
"115740052-0-21146","Why must you resist us? Let the waters run through you!",""
"115740052-0-21147","Be quick and stay quiet. It's the only certain way to remain alive.",""
"115740052-0-21148","You have the energy. Good. I've created magic foci to receive each element.",""
"115740052-0-21149","One person must channel on the staff and three others on the foci. This will open the way.",""
"115740052-0-21150","Good work. I'll meet you inside.",""
"115740052-0-21151","What is this place? It's like some other plane inside this object. But where are we? Oblivion? Aetherius?",""
"115740052-0-21152","Interesting. It looks like it's possible to cross between the islands.",""
"115740052-0-21153","This is such a strange place. You never know what's going to happen next.",""
"115740052-0-21154","A word, if you will, my friend. I believe I can be of help.",""
"115740052-0-21155","Work faster, damned sendings!",""
"115740052-0-21156","Hmm, no path here. Let me see if I can do anything with these floating rocks.",""
"115740052-0-21157","I read a story once about Arch-Mage Shalidor fashioning a bridge out of pieces of shattered glass. This requires … much less effort.",""
"115740052-0-21158","Hm. It looks like I'll be able to contain the core once these crystals are disconnected.",""
"115740052-0-21159","The core is releasing a lot of magicka. We need to be careful, especially when I disconnect the crystals.",""
"115740052-0-21160","Magicka will pour out when I disconnect the crystal. You'll need to defend me, or we won't be able to finish.",""
"115740052-0-21161","Intruders! They must not reach the Mage!",""
"115740052-0-21162","There's the core on the far side of these floating islands. We have to stop it from overloading.",""
"115740052-0-21163","Now, how are we going to get over there?",""
"115740052-0-21164","Now I just have to cast a barrier around the core. Wish me luck!",""
"115740052-0-21165","Hara! What's wrong?",""
"115740052-0-21166","Uhf. We did it. We sealed the core. Give me a minute to catch my breath.",""
"115740052-0-21167","All right. All better. Let's get going.",""
"115740052-0-21168","Time is not on our—",""
"115740052-0-21169","What are you doing here? No one is supposed to enter here. Are you another of the Serpent's slaves? Go away!",""
"115740052-0-21170","Hm. Seems like there's some kind of guardian here. She's so far gone she doesn't realize how bad the core's gotten.",""
"115740052-0-21171","I will not let you compromise the core. This is my staff. This is my power, not yours, foul Serpent!",""
"115740052-0-21172","There's definitely something still active here. I can feel the magicka pulsing in these stones.",""
"115740052-0-21173","You defy me then. Very well. I will not allow you to destroy my people. Instead, I will destroy you.",""
"115740052-0-21174","The way to me won't be that easy. But continue if you must. My pet awaits you and he's hungry.",""
"115740052-0-21175","Even nature itself has joined with me. Why do you resist? Why not join me? I can give you all the power you would ever need, just as I gave power to the people of this city!",""
"115740052-0-21176","Have you ever watched a spider play with its food? It's exhilarating.",""
"115740052-0-21177","You kill innocent creatures that only wish to live. Spiders, Nedes, it matters not to you, does it? The thrill of the kill. Just like the Yokudans, you lay waste to everything in your path.",""
"115740052-0-21178","Doesn't it gnaw at you? All these years, buried beneath the sands, and suddenly a hole opens and there it is—the lost city! It's no coincidence. There are forces at work that you should fear far more than you fear me.",""
"115740052-0-21179","Be careful where you step, mortal. These Nereids are my shield maidens. They empower those I protect. They could empower you, if only you would give yourself to me.",""
"115740052-0-21180","Those who once walked among the stars now tread upon the ground, destroying everything in their path. Don't you want to defeat them? All you need to do is drink the water ….",""
"115740052-0-21181","Murderer! I opened my city to you. I offered you hope and you repay me with destruction! Fine. Then let the destroyer be destroyed!",""
"115740052-0-21182","Your resistance ends here. I will bend you to my will. Make you commander of my armies. Not even the Celestials will stand against us!",""
"115740052-0-21183","Maidens, give me your power and protection!",""
"115740052-0-21184","Taste the power. I promise you will not regret it.",""
"115740052-0-21185","No. I will not be defeated. I will devour you!",""
"115740052-0-21186","This one won't let you perish, Saraali!",""
"115740052-0-21187","She does not arouse from her slumber …. What did this one miss?",""
"115740052-0-21188","This one's still bleeding ….",""
"115740052-0-21189","Shada is dead! The waters are safe, and so … refreshing.nnHurry. Gather the injured for treatment. And let's not forget the ones we've lost.",""
"115740052-0-21190","You are no match for the ancient magic of my most powerful servant.",""
"115740052-0-21191","And this is why you should inform this Hara of yours immediately. It is urgent that we speak to her.",""
"115740052-0-21192","Yes, we are wasting time repeating ourselves to a … lackey.",""
"115740052-0-21193","I'm trying to understand what you just told me. There are other versions of you elsewhere in Craglorn?",""
"115740052-0-21194","As we explained—and with exceptional clarity—we are merely aspects of the one you call the Celestial Mage. Even as we stand here, the Serpent seeks to control us all!",""
"115740052-0-21195","Even now he gathers our aspects to use as his own, assembling them into a false Mage who is entirely in his control.",""
"115740052-0-21196","Yes, of course. Whatever you say. I'll talk to Hara, but I can't make any promises. The constellations have disappeared from the sky and we have other things to deal with right now.",""
"115740052-0-21197","The stars shine before him, pleading for help, and he's too busy looking at the empty sky to realize it.",""
"115740052-0-21198","A drink, then, to ease our patience. You, mortal servant, deliver us your finest—what's the word—ale?",""
"115740052-0-21199","Ale? But the brewer serves drinks in the other room ….",""
"115740052-0-21200","Quickly, dive to the passageway! We'll follow behind you!",""
"115740052-0-21201","There! In the center! A passage must have opened below the water!",""
"115740052-0-21202","The Scaled One grows stronger. Another part of us has been lost.",""
"115740052-0-21203","The Snake eats and eats and never grows full. His hunger is endless.",""
"115740052-0-21204","Our time grows short. But the mortal has returned with the Seeker's Sight.",""
"115740052-0-21205","Then converse with our helper. If the Serpent continues to feast, no power will be able to stand against him.",""
"115740052-0-21206","Hara has finally agreed to see us and we will meet with her soon. Do not delay. The enemy grows strong and time is not on our side.",""
"115740052-0-21207","Thank you again. I should check in at the Mages Guild and give my report. We can determine how we want to handle the Staff from there.",""
"115740052-0-21208","Hara! What have you done to her?",""
"115740052-0-21209","He found me … you must ….",""
"115740052-0-21210","Nothing! Something just came over her. Hara, what can we do?",""
"115740052-0-21211","Who found you? Who is doing this to you?",""
"115740052-0-21212","Find the ruins … Reinhold's Retreat …. Hidden there … you must ….",""
"115740052-0-21213","A strange relic, this Seeker's Sight. It's a compass of sorts, you say?",""
"115740052-0-21214","Well, place it within the star map and let's see what happens.",""
"115740052-0-21215","<Anguished scream.>",""
"115740052-0-21216","No!",""
"115740052-0-21217","She's gone … just … gone.",""
"115740052-0-21218","It's working. See how our other aspects appear.",""
"115740052-0-21219","Thanks to this relic, we can locate the remaining aspects before the Scaled One.",""
"115740052-0-21220","What is that strange one over there? It's different from the others.",""
"115740052-0-21221","That's the Lost One. The part of us corrupted and controlled by the Scaled One.",""
"115740052-0-21222","Let's not concern ourselves with her just yet. The other aspects are our first priority.",""
"115740052-0-21223","Do not worry about me. I can reach the other aspects on my own.",""
"115740052-0-21224","If you have other tasks, I suggest you hurry. The Lost One continues to grow in power.",""
"115740052-0-21225","Watch yourself as you exit this cave. You resemble food to the residents of this place.",""
"115740052-0-21226","When you finish your tasks, meet us back at this winery. We will proceed with our plan from there",""
"115740052-0-21227","Hey, what're you doing in here? Danni? Is that you?",""
"115740052-0-21228","Onsi's blade! We've been spotted. We can't let her tell the others we're here!",""
"115740052-0-21229","I'll find Kelmen and meet you at the lake. Nazdura, come. There's nothing more we can do for Hara here.",""
"115740052-0-21230","You made it. Good. We could not proceed without you.",""
"115740052-0-21231","The aspects have been gathered. It is time to confront the Lost One.",""
"115740052-0-21232","We know exactly where she hides. At the beginning. At the source of our power.",""
"115740052-0-21233","Spineless worms. Did you not think we would come for her? Did you not know you would bring our wrath upon your heads?",""
"115740052-0-21234","The stench of corruption pervades the air. Be wary. A powerful practitioner of dark sorcery is nearby.",""
"115740052-0-21235","You're too late. The Apex Stone is ours! The Thief will fall under my master's sway and none will be left to stand against us!",""
"115740052-0-21236","Hah! None can stand before us. We're coming, Hara! Just hold on!",""
"115740052-0-21237","She mentioned another Apex Stone. Could it be that the Thief's stone has been hidden here all along?",""
"115740052-0-21238","There! The Apex Stone! What are they doing to it? Is this how they corrupt the stones and enslave the Guardians?",""
"115740052-0-21239","Look! It's Hara! Why would they have her here? We have to find a way to free her!",""
"115740052-0-21240","Wait, I hear someone coming.",""
"115740052-0-21241","This might be good. Let's see what happens.",""
"115740052-0-21242","Hear me Nocturnal, your priestess brings news.",""
"115740052-0-21243","What is it mortal?",""
"115740052-0-21244","The Gray Barrow is prepared and your power spreads.",""
"115740052-0-21245","We've gained another foothold in Tamriel.",""
"115740052-0-21246","Cosh is making preparations for celebration in your name.",""
"115740052-0-21247","We now seek recruits worthy of your blessing to grow our cult.",""
"115740052-0-21248","Very well.",""
"115740052-0-21249","Goodbye.",""
"115740052-0-21250","We'll wait for her to leave.",""
"115740052-0-21251","Once she's gone, you the Cypher and map she mentioned. I'm going to follow Mura.",""
"115740052-0-21252","Good, she's gone. Let's go!",""
"115740052-0-21253","Now, get those items. I'll meet you back up at The Lass once you're done!",""
"115740052-0-21254","On your guard, friends. Enemies lie in wait ahead. Scaled Court by the looks of them.",""
"115740052-0-21255","The Lost One waits for us. She knows we are coming.",""
"115740052-0-21256","I sense her presence. Below. She waits in the shadow of our Apex Stone.",""
"115740052-0-21257","Defeat the Lost One and we will do the rest.",""
"115740052-0-21258","Do not hold back. If you hesitate or falter, the Lost One will destroy you.",""
"115740052-0-21259","You've arrived too late my sister. Even your new friends won't be able to stop me from reaching the helmet first.",""
"115740052-0-21260","Let's get going boys. They're taking the long way around.",""
"115740052-0-21261","You're persistant. We'll have to do something to slow you up.",""
"115740052-0-21262","You two hold your ground. You're going to wait for them.",""
"115740052-0-21263","Good gods, these High Elves are mad.",""
"115740052-0-21264","What's happened to you brother?",""
"115740052-0-21265","We got overrune. It was all I could do to get away. What have I done?",""
"115740052-0-21266","You've lost a lot of blood. I've got to get you out of here.",""
"115740052-0-21267","My friends, I beg you to see this through for me while I attend my brother. We'll meet you back at the entrance.",""
"115740052-0-21268","You mean the Celestial Mage? The Serpent controls the Mage? How is that possible?",""
"115740052-0-21269","Monarch of Frost, Monarch of Fire, Monarch of Storms. Rise up from Oblivion and answer my command.",""
"115740052-0-21270","Trickery. Deceit. And once he controlled her, he turned her power against us and enslaved us.",""
"115740052-0-21271","Why go to all this trouble?",""
"115740052-0-21272","Because that is what the Serpent does. He has used the Mage to create a new monarch. One with all of our powers. One made of pure air.",""
"115740052-0-21273","Where can we find this new monarch?",""
"115740052-0-21274","We do not know. All we remember is a name. Balamath.",""
"115740052-0-21275","Balamath? I know that place. It's an Ayleid ruin. Thank you. You are dismissed.",""
"115740052-0-21276","Defeat the Serpent's abomination. Defeat the Monarch of Air and we will tell our master of your kindness.",""
"115740052-0-21277","All right—break's over, squirt. Get back to work.",""
"115740052-0-21278","Break? I'm not on a break! I'm on lookout duty.",""
"115740052-0-21279","Lookout? What in Oblivion are you looking out for?",""
"115740052-0-21280","Raiders! Slavers! Rabid miners! It's dangerous out here. Gotta keep these keen eyes on the horizon!",""
"115740052-0-21281","Good point. There's just no telling how many brigands want to steal our hoard of totally worthless stone.",""
"115740052-0-21282","Well … there could be gems in those stones.",""
"115740052-0-21283","There could be gems in your head. Should I grab a pick and find out?",""
"115740052-0-21284","Fine, fine. I'm on my way. Gotta, y'know, find my pick and such.  Might take a minute … or ten.",""
"115740052-0-21285","The others are near. I can sense them. You think to stop me? I am too strong for you, mortal. I cannot be defeated.",""
"115740052-0-21286","Fools! This stone is the source of my strength. You cannot defeat me here.",""
"115740052-0-21287","What do we have here?",""
"115740052-0-21288","You know, it's very unsettling the way you pop in and out like that.",""
"115740052-0-21289","I wouldn't be a very good Thief if I couldn't come and go as I please.",""
"115740052-0-21290","Well, I've done what you asked of me. Are you satisfied?",""
"115740052-0-21291","You have done well and I appreciate your efforts. Thanks to you, the Star-Gazers now understand the nature of the atronach threat and how to stop it.",""
"115740052-0-21292","Lost One. Surrender yourself. Shake off the Serpent's control. You have lost. Join with us of your own free will and we shall be whole again.",""

"115740052-0-21295","Gods, no. Lerien!",""
"115740052-0-21296","I'll suck the marrow from your bones!",""
"115740052-0-21297","Here we go. Let me do the talking.",""
"115740052-0-21298","Is that… Razum-dar?",""

"115740052-0-21307","This particular group of Nocturnal cultists we're looking for call themselves the Violet Lodge.",""
"115740052-0-21308","The name may sound innocent, but it's members are far from.",""
"115740052-0-21309","Probably the most corrupt and manipulative people you'll ever meet.",""
"115740052-0-21310","They're a secret society throughout Tamriel.",""

"115740052-0-21316","My assistant and I had a bit of an… altercation with some Dunmer, and we're here to file a report. Closest place, you know.nnSeemed fitting to have a drink while we're visiting. Quite cold, here.",""

"115740052-0-21318","Ha! No, of course not. My assistant will, of course, be happy to handle that.",""
"115740052-0-21319","Go on. I'll be here.",""
"115740052-0-21320","Now, about that drink…",""
"115740052-0-21321","I see you skulking around ….",""
"115740052-0-21322","Hey … If you were going to be a famous thief, what would you call yourself?",""
"115740052-0-21323","Skeeversbane. Like I am now.",""
"115740052-0-21324","The Crimson … Claw. Yes?",""
"115740052-0-21325","This is foolish. Good thieves don't pick their own nicknames.",""
"115740052-0-21326","Me, I'd want to be the Masked Mongoose. Because mongooses are clever, you know?",""
"115740052-0-21327","There you are! They said I'd probably find you looking for a way in, but you seem to have managed.",""
"115740052-0-21328","Now, about that paperwo— oh, blast. Damned elves.",""
"115740052-0-21329","Do you ever feel like the dock smell is following you?",""
"115740052-0-21330","This one does. Her nose is very sensitive, too—and it smells so bad!",""
"115740052-0-21331","It's Skeeversbane. The smell, I mean.",""
"115740052-0-21332","I can't help it! I have a condition … it's alchemical or something, I swear. I'm cursed.",""
"115740052-0-21333","I remember hearing when I was young that this was some sort of pirate port. I don't think that's true anymore.",""
"115740052-0-21334","Stop a moment and think about what you just said.",""
"115740052-0-21335","What do you mean? Are there pirates around here?",""
"115740052-0-21336","Yes. They are all over the other side of the island, this one knows. She has seen their sails.",""
"115740052-0-21337","Even I know that, and I live under a pile of trash and dead skeevers.",""
"115740052-0-21338","Mura, I've brought the Gray Barrows map as requested.",""
"115740052-0-21339","Thank you, Edrun. Put it on the table. I'll get to it later. Now, leave me. I must report.",""
"115740052-0-21340","I'll make sure you aren't disturbed.",""
"115740052-0-21341","I wish we had more food. I'm tired of going hungry so often.",""
"115740052-0-21342","What I wouldn't give for a nice wheel of mammoth cheese right now …",""
"115740052-0-21343","I'm not hungry at all. You two aren't very good at this, are you?",""
"115740052-0-21344","Sepaea also does not hunger. She knows the places food can be found without cost, you know.",""
"115740052-0-21345","Well, if either of you seasoned veterans would care to educate us with your advanced skills, I'd appreciate it.",""
"115740052-0-21346","My friend. Are you there?",""
"115740052-0-21347","Not a moment too soon!",""
"115740052-0-21348","A fiery mountain rises from the snake's pit.",""
"115740052-0-21349","Be at peace. There are none here to threaten you.",""
"115740052-0-21350","Well look who's back. How are you, bright eyes? Where's Danni?",""
"115740052-0-21351","This sword will sing a razor song when it draws across the snake's neck.",""
"115740052-0-21352","Save your anger. The Serpent's punishment will come, but we must free our mutual friend.",""
"115740052-0-21353","Lookie here, gang. Our lovely friend here discovered something nefarious about our fearless leader.",""
"115740052-0-21354","A fiery mountain rises from the snake's pit.",""
"115740052-0-21355","Is that so? What's the news? Did some of Danni's old love letters crop up or something?",""
"115740052-0-21356","Love letters? Why would that be important. If so, I'll be very cross that you dragged me away from my work for something so trivial.",""
"115740052-0-21357","Ladies, ladies. Allow me to illuminate your illustrious minds. It seems our friend found a note from one of the Lodge members to Dann. Seems pretty friendly, too, as if she was an old chum of the Lodge.",""
"115740052-0-21358","What? I don't believe that. Let me see that note.",""
"115740052-0-21359","And I quote: 'On behalf of the Violet Lodge blah blah blah we are very excited for you to join our ranks blah blah blah Sincerely, Danni.'nnWell, I'd say that speaks for itself now, doesn't it?",""
"115740052-0-21360","I don't know. I'm sure there's a perfectly sound explanation for whatever that is.",""
"115740052-0-21361","There must be. Come, rook, follow me. There's only one way to find out. We'll have to find more evidence in Danni's room.",""
"115740052-0-21362","I don't think we should be rummaging through Danni's stuff when she's away. It doesn't feel right.",""
"115740052-0-21363","Don't be ridiculous. I go through your stuff all the time. There're no secrets among thieves.",""
"115740052-0-21364","I think you mean ""there's no honor among thieves.""",""
"115740052-0-21365","Same thing. And … there. The door's unlocked. Come on, friend. Let's see what Danni might be hiding from us.",""
"115740052-0-21366","Speak for yourself.",""
"115740052-0-21367","The bookkeeper and the madcap. The sword was saved by peasants?",""
"115740052-0-21368","Use the gem on each stone focus to summon the atronachs.",""
"115740052-0-21369","Did you find something? Bring it here.",""
"115740052-0-21370","Danni! Why, don't you look lovely today. Welcome back. Did everything go well with your little adventure?",""
"115740052-0-21371","Shut it, Nick. Vexa, what were you doing in my room? What's going on here?",""
"115740052-0-21372","The Rook found a note you sent to one of the Lodge members years ago. We were in your rooms because we were suspicious and wanted to find out more.",""
"115740052-0-21373","Did you find anything good, Vex?",""
"115740052-0-21374","My friend. Are you there?",""
"115740052-0-21375","My thoughts are my own again. Who—oh. You.",""
"115740052-0-21376","We found a Violet Lodge uniform in her room. She was hiding it from us.What do you make of that?",""
"115740052-0-21377","I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for all of this. Danni would never be a part of something like the Violet Lodge. Right, Danni?",""
"115740052-0-21378","It has been some time.",""
"115740052-0-21379","Not long enough.",""
"115740052-0-21380","What do you mean?",""
"115740052-0-21381","It's … it's true, Gwen. I was a part of the Violet Lodge. But I can explain!",""
"115740052-0-21382","Oh, this should be good!",""
"115740052-0-21383","Let her speak, Nick. She deserves to say her peace.",""
"115740052-0-21384","I was young and desperate. The Lodge took me in and took care of me. They gave me safety and a sense of purpose. I was happy there. I didn't know any better.",""
"115740052-0-21385","Storm clouds have gathered to bathe the snake in lightning.",""
"115740052-0-21386","My thoughts are my own again.",""
"115740052-0-21387","Then we are all together.",""
"115740052-0-21388","What is he doing here?",""
"115740052-0-21389","I see. So you're still working with them, then. And you're playing each of us for fools.",""
"115740052-0-21390","No, I'm not with the Lodge anymore. I left them years ago, when I was older and wiser and their true rotteness was exposed. And I vowed that when I left I would get my revenge on them.",""
"115740052-0-21391","We believe you, Danni. We all have a past. Something we don't want to come to light. But there's no use dwelling on it now. Besides, we've got a party to get ready for.",""
"115740052-0-21392","Speak for yourself, Gwenneth, you beautiful vixen. But yes, you are correct. It's time to party. Let's put on our best faces and get ready to please Danni's old friends.",""
"115740052-0-21393","Ha! Just like the Aqueduct. I'm almost disappointed.",""
"115740052-0-21394","After you!",""
"115740052-0-21401","The offer of the star teeth sealed my compact with Mephala. She was very interested in their secrets.",""
"115740052-0-21402","Your mother can't cook! There. I said it!",""
"115740052-0-21403","Iranya must be new to the Lodge if she left her house wide open like this. You'd think a secret organization would train their recruits better than that.",""
"115740052-0-21404","Altmer houses are so … gaudy. I can't imagine how those elves live in such garish surroundings. Give me the sands of Alik'r any day.",""
"115740052-0-21405","Cosh must be loosening his purse strings. The Lodge would never put one of their members in a boat,  such as this one.",""
"115740052-0-21406","This reminds me of the time I helped to steal a frigate from King Emeric's royal navy. It was a good boat, too, until Nicholas decided to get drunk and steer the ship blindfolded.",""
"115740052-0-21407","Any luck yet, rook? If so, bring it here.",""
"115740052-0-21408","I never understood why my people aligned with the Bretons. Look at this house. It has no charm to it. Just like the Bretons themselves.",""
"115740052-0-21409","I've heard of Miss Ancois's activities in the Lodge. She's lazy and untrustworthy, even for a member of the Lodge. Seems fitting that we could just waltz right in here.",""
"115740052-0-21410","Oh, Daggerfall. This place brings back memories. I'v broken into this tower before. Meline must've gotten a little wiser over the years. Still not wise enough, though.",""
"115740052-0-21411","She's really put some effort into this place. Meline must've decided to redecorate after I robbed her blind last time.",""
"115740052-0-21412","Ugh. Argonians. No wonder their door wasn't locked. Who'd want to steal from this dingy mud hut?",""
"115740052-0-21413","The Violet Lodge doesn't emply many Argonians. They're afraid the connection to the Hist would spoil their secret plans. This Argonian must be rather untrustworthy to be a member of the Lodge.",""
"115740052-0-21414","This place reeks of cat urine. I think the Lodge must be pulling some strings with the local Jarl. They should condemn this building based on the smell alone.",""
"115740052-0-21415","Old Frikkhild is well connected in this city. The Lodge was wise to recruit her.",""
"115740052-0-21416","What's this here?",""
"115740052-0-21417","The Brothers Ilambris—defeated again. A shame Daedra don't stay dead.",""
"115740052-0-21418","I don't know how you lot escaped from torture, but it will resume.",""
"115740052-0-21419","The battle's begun. Captain needs you topside.",""
"115740052-0-21420","Wait, I'll open a portal so you can get out of the city.",""
"115740052-0-21421","That should send you to the refugees outside of the city. I'm going to help the rest of the civilians in Elinhir to escape. Thank you for your help.",""
"115740052-0-21422","Thank you, my friend! See you at the Lass!",""
"115740052-0-21423","Your mother can't cook! There. I said it!",""
"115740052-0-21424","Glad you two could make it!",""
"115740052-0-21425","Just finished tying up Lerien's affairs. What he lacked in motivation, he made up for in life complications.",""
"115740052-0-21426","You were right about this place, Danni. A little added security and it's home sweet home.",""
"115740052-0-21427","We lost a good man back there, Danni.",""
"115740052-0-21428","I know. Rest assured, Lerien's death is avenged.",""
"115740052-0-21429","Good. We owe him that.",""
"115740052-0-21430","And now, we finally get to meet your latest recruit!",""
"115740052-0-21431","Oh yes. Sorry I didn't have time in Abah's.",""
"115740052-0-21432","Nicolas, Vexa, our newest recruit!",""
"115740052-0-21433","Go introduce yourself.",""
"115740052-0-21434","I said, ""You are right."" I have words for the snake. Where is he?",""
"115740052-0-21435","Far from here. We will need your strength to reckon with him.",""
"115740052-0-21436","To end him, you mean.",""
"115740052-0-21437","Would you end the sun for lighting the sky?  His death would only cause more peril. We will stop him, not murder him. And it will take all of us.",""
"115740052-0-21438","Appeal to the soldier for help? All he understands is violence.",""
"115740052-0-21439","We need only free him and point him in the Serpent's direction.",""
"115740052-0-21440","Make certain he walks in front of us.",""
"115740052-0-21441","The book keeper? What need does a sword have for a book keeper?",""
"115740052-0-21442","The Marketplace is ours! They will try to take it back. We need to fortify our defenses and watch for incoming waves of Daedra!",""
"115740052-0-21443","The Mage is competent in ways you and I are not. We will need her to stop the Serpent.",""
"115740052-0-21444","One cannot stop the snake. This sword will behead him.",""
"115740052-0-21445","The Serpent belongs in the natural order. Would you behead the sun for wronging you?",""
"115740052-0-21446","Yes.",""
"115740052-0-21447","Darkness would envelope the land. The seas would freeze.",""
"115740052-0-21448","Then this sword would walk the seas, cut by moonlight.",""
"115740052-0-21449","How do we stop it?",""
"115740052-0-21450","What would you cut?",""
"115740052-0-21451","Wait. On your guard! Enemies approach.",""
"115740052-0-21452","Nords.",""
"115740052-0-21453","These aetherial stones are linked. I see now! Split off and use them both before their power fades!",""
"115740052-0-21454","There would be no Nords. Nor your precious Anka-Ra. Does that sound favorable?",""
"115740052-0-21455","Quickly, before more arrive!",""
"115740052-0-21456","Fascinating! She knew this place was protected by aetherial power! A trap set by a Thief for a … a thief.",""
"115740052-0-21457","Hah! We've done it!",""
"115740052-0-21458","Why do I get the feeling this isn't over?",""
"115740052-0-21459","We will not fall here!",""
"115740052-0-21460","No.",""
"115740052-0-21461","You always underestimated the will of the true heroes of this world, Malazar! Witness the foreshadowing of your doom!",""
"115740052-0-21462","These mortals will see to it that your chaos is undone. We will reunite the Guardians, and you will be banished once more!",""
"115740052-0-21463","Could it really be…?",""
"115740052-0-21464","The Serpent's death would only cause more peril. We will stop him, not murder him. Come. Let us nfree the Mage.",""
"115740052-0-21465","Hara… You? All along?",""
"115740052-0-21466","It had to be this way. But the time for deception is ended. Now is the time for action.",""
"115740052-0-21467","This one sees a little worm! Come, little worm. We will feast on you.",""
"115740052-0-21468","I have eaten bigger bites than you, little morsel.",""
"115740052-0-21469","So much delicious magicka. Sweeter than moon-sugar pastries!",""
"115740052-0-21470","I should have eaten Minerva's soul first. I will fix that mistake, when I'm done with you.",""
"115740052-0-21471","Be at peace. There are none here to threaten you.",""
"115740052-0-21472","How dare you!",""
"115740052-0-21473","We were all saved by the mortals. It is time we helped them in return. Are you ready to do battle? It will take all of us to stop the Serpent.",""
"115740052-0-21474","This sword will sing a razor song when it draws across the snake's neck.",""
"115740052-0-21475","If we must. The soldier walks where I can see him.",""
"115740052-0-21476","This sword walks where it pleases.",""
"115740052-0-21477","Enough. The Serpent has withdrawn to the highlands, where his worshippers protect him. He is guarded against my vision.",""
"115740052-0-21478","I have a spell or two that will find him out. And rearrange his insides.",""
"115740052-0-21479","This sword will fell all the trees in the land—the snake's head is bound to roll from among them!",""
"115740052-0-21480","We are not to slay the Serpent. We must return home to restore the natural order—the Serpent included.",""
"115740052-0-21481","Are we done here?",""
"115740052-0-21482","The cliffracer caws because she adores the sound of her own voice.",""
"115740052-0-21483","<Sigh.>",""
"115740052-0-21484","It will take all of us to stop the Serpent. Are you well enough to do battle?",""
"115740052-0-21485","The mountain will do battle enough for all three!",""
"115740052-0-21486","It's just up ahead.",""
"115740052-0-21487","And it's under guard. Be careful.",""
"115740052-0-21488","All that should concern you is that it counsels me. It convinced me of your betrayal, of the need for the students to pay for their insolence.",""
"115740052-0-21489","It has led you astray.",""
"115740052-0-21490","Let's keep moving.",""
"115740052-0-21491","The Daedra have destroyed much of the school.",""
"115740052-0-21492","On the contrary, this Blade grants me a clarity I never had in life. And I will have you respect it.",""
"115740052-0-21493","The ritual site isn't here. We should keep moving.",""
"115740052-0-21494","You're wasting your time! I'll collect the star teeth you've gathered from your lifeless bodies!",""
"115740052-0-21495","You were one of them? Mages like you destroyed our city!",""
"115740052-0-21496","Minerva had no part in this. She's only tried to help us, Rithanion. Your fight isn't with her!",""
"115740052-0-21497","No, she's right. I didn't help the Blackcasters, but I didn't stop them either. I must accept some of the blame.",""
"115740052-0-21498","Come closer! Time for this one to feast!",""
"115740052-0-21499","You struggle in vain!",""
"115740052-0-21500","This one cannot be defeated!",""
"115740052-0-21501","What? This is … not a good feeling.",""
"115740052-0-21502","So I says to Nick, I says, 'What do you mean? He lost his tail before I got there!""",""
"115740052-0-21503","Do you mind? I'm trying to concentrate. I've just had a breakthrough with this device.",""
"115740052-0-21504","I'm almost done. Just one more minute.",""
"115740052-0-21505","Hey Vexa! How's the device coming along?",""
"115740052-0-21506","All right. Just make sure it works. I remember your security system you made for Magistrate Scarius. It was a good idea, but I was able to disable it rather easily.",""
"115740052-0-21507","First off, you're a liar. That system was air-tight. Second, you wouldn't know a good device if it bit your head off. Third, it's done. Don't break it before you use it.",""
"115740052-0-21508","Thanks, mate. You're the best. Rook, I'll take the device. You find Nicolas and drag his sorry ass to Abah's Landing. I'll meet you there.",""
"115740052-0-21509","Hey, you! You looking for that Nick guy?",""
"115740052-0-21510","You found him. I knew Danni would send you to find me.",""
"115740052-0-21511","Look, it's not so much that she lied. People lie to me every day. It's the trust.",""
"115740052-0-21512","We'll be the greatest thieves that ever lived! A new horizon for the guild!",""
"115740052-0-21513","We're not hitting the Vault for the guild. We're not working to bring about a new age for people in our line of work.",""
"115740052-0-21514","This is all about revenge. This is about getting back at someone that hurt her. She could have … she could have told us.",""
"115740052-0-21515","Some people in the guild. I won't name names. But some of them have about as much idea of what it means to trust someone as a rabid nix-hound.",""
"115740052-0-21516","And then some of us are just in it for the thrill, for the money. The rush as you leap from the rooftop.",""
"115740052-0-21518","You won't win, Malazar. I am too strong for you!",""
"115740052-0-21519","Turn back! I will not be responsible for your deaths!",""
"115740052-0-21520","Emissary! What's wrong? And … by the Divines, it's like the insides of a troll!",""
"115740052-0-21521","My magic will destroy you! It rages like a storm through this tower!",""
"115740052-0-21522","You underestimate me, Valla. I have more tricks at my disposal than you could ever imagine.",""
"115740052-0-21523","I came to this Archive to contain the damage I could cause. My loss of control blasted all that you see into terrible existence. Why do you persist? Turn back!",""
"115740052-0-21524","I have drawn you out of your Apex Stone and made you vulnerable. I know the power you wield. I am not fool enough to try to swallow you whole. But a piece at a time ….",""
"115740052-0-21525","Why are you here? Are you like the Firstmages, seeking power? Mortals are such fools.",""
"115740052-0-21526","I will not let you do this. I will stop you!",""
"115740052-0-21527","Protest as you will, but I have already won.",""
"115740052-0-21528","I summoned these creatures, raised these obstructions to keep outsiders from reaching me. Stay back!",""
"115740052-0-21529","Everything warps in my presence. Even these, the tower's gardens. They will shield me from you.",""
"115740052-0-21530","Mortals. No appreciation or understanding of what I do for them. I warned you to leave, and take no responsibility for what happens.",""
"115740052-0-21531","Stop the interlopers! They wish to harm the Learned One!",""
"115740052-0-21532","Now, mortals, you will die.",""
"115740052-0-21533","How many foes ….",""
"115740052-0-21534","… Can you weather?",""
"115740052-0-21535","And how will you fare ….",""

"115740052-0-21542","My armory has a mind of its own.",""
"115740052-0-21543","Too many of 'em. Beware the horn.",""
"115740052-0-21544","When I do battle, I do not battle alone!",""
"115740052-0-21545","My magic will tear this realm apart!",""

"115740052-0-21547","There were too many. Beware the horn.",""
"115740052-0-21548","Tell Kailstig we failed.",""
"115740052-0-21549","The mortals push on. Impressive, but futile.",""
"115740052-0-21550","Enough!",""
"115740052-0-21551","I wanted to spare you!",""
"115740052-0-21552","Warn you!",""
"115740052-0-21553","Air and sand can cut like blades in the wind—Ra Kotu will prove this!",""

"115740052-0-21559","The Serpent no longer clouds my mind. My sword will claim his neck.",""
"115740052-0-21560","The Serpent is already defeated. There are none left to threaten you. Now, come. We must restore the natural order of things.",""
"115740052-0-21561","My thoughts are my own again.",""
"115740052-0-21562","I have words for the snake. Where is he?",""
"115740052-0-21563","To end him, you mean.",""
"115740052-0-21564","Always the pragmatist.",""
"115740052-0-21565","It has been some time.",""
"115740052-0-21566","Far from here. We will need your strength to reckon with him.",""
"115740052-0-21567","Would you end the sun for lighting the sky?  His death would only cause more peril. We will stop him, not murder him. And it will take all of us.",""
"115740052-0-21568","My thoughts are my own again.",""
"115740052-0-21569","It has been some time.",""
"115740052-0-21570","I have words for the snake. Where is he?",""
"115740052-0-21571","Defeated. Come, now. We must restore the natural order of things.",""
"115740052-0-21572","These ""Undaunted"" think themselves warriors? Pathetic.",""
"115740052-0-21573","The mortals have come far. But only Ansei of First Rank are allowed in this chamber.",""
"115740052-0-21574","My soldiers of sand and steel will strip your flesh.",""
"115740052-0-21575","You have come farther than those feeble Undaunted. But you will fall just the same.",""
"115740052-0-21576","Interesting. These stones seem to be designed as magical defenses, though they lay dormant now. I wonder what other secrets regarding the Nedes have been lost to time.",""
"115740052-0-21577","How much does the magistrate pay you to hold <<1>>?",""
"115740052-0-21578","I see! The aetherial stones are recharged by souls. We can use them to our advantage!",""
"115740052-0-21579","The aetherial stone is active! We can use it against our foe!",""
"115740052-0-21580","I tell you what. You can join him for free. No? Ha. Didn't think so.",""
"115740052-0-21581","The aetherial stones! Quickly! They are our only chance here!",""
"115740052-0-21582","Fight on! We need to keep recharging the stones!",""
"115740052-0-21583","I don't believe it! Would you look at this place!",""
"115740052-0-21584","The Warrior and his army of old Yokuda claim the citadel of Hel Ra. Leave—and live. Trespass—and die. You have been warned.",""
"115740052-0-21585","Their past doesn't matter. The magistrate is in charge now, and <<1>> should remember that.",""
"115740052-0-21586","I suppose. But you can only strike a dog so much before it turns on you.",""
"115740052-0-21587","If she does, <<1>> gets far worse than the stocks. <<2>> will fall in line. No question.",""
"115740052-0-21588","That ship, the Greenhalgh? Have you seen it before?",""
"115740052-0-21589","At the eastern beaches? They aren't with any raiding bands. That's all I know.",""
"115740052-0-21590","Send <<1>> to find out what he can. Headman <<2>> has no patience for surprises.",""
"115740052-0-21591","Excellent work. Now, to see what sort of setup the Lodge has going on here.",""
"115740052-0-21596","Ra Kotu once served the Celestial Mage, but I unlocked her true potential.",""
"115740052-0-21597","Surprisingly efficient—for a Thief. Fall in behind me. I will take charge from here on.",""
"115740052-0-21598","For the Warrior Celestial, we claim your lives!",""
"115740052-0-21599","You are truly foolish to come farther. This Atronach gives way to no one.",""
"115740052-0-21600","Varlariel, mother of mothers, will never allow you to reach me. Turn back before she feasts on your flesh.",""
"115740052-0-21601","Poor Nicky boy. Are you all done crying into your beer?",""
"115740052-0-21602","Lucky for you, I ran out of tears before I ran out of ale.",""
"115740052-0-21603","Danni! The lost lamb returns.",""
"115740052-0-21604","Give up, dear girl. Nocturnal will welcome you back.",""
"115740052-0-21605","I'll eat your spleen!",""
"115740052-0-21606","Nerien'eth will answer for this. He has to.",""
"115740052-0-21607","Now that they're gone, we can go after the vault!",""
"115740052-0-21608","Welcome, initiates, to the Vault of Shadows.",""
"115740052-0-21609","You're all here today due your interest in the Violet Lodge and our interest in you.",""
"115740052-0-21610","Each of you have displayed talents that may be beneficial for us, but first: the initiation.",""
"115740052-0-21611","We will begin with a small ritual.",""
"115740052-0-21612","We then move on to test various skills that you all may possess.",""
"115740052-0-21613","And finally, you'll be inducted into the Violet Lodge at the great altar of Nocturnal herself.",""
"115740052-0-21614","Now, if you're ready…",""
"115740052-0-21615","Follow me.",""
"115740052-0-21616","Enter.",""
"115740052-0-21617","You're dead meat!",""
"115740052-0-21618","Ah. More morsels for the feast. Quite an eclectic mix of flavors, I must say.",""
"115740052-0-21619","You won't get far. This place is not for mortals.",""
"115740052-0-21620","The chambers are just this way, follow me!",""
"115740052-0-21621","Look at you Banu, all fat and happy on that hill. It's what you always wanted.",""
"115740052-0-21622","I'll open the lock on the other side. The study is just a bit farther.",""
"115740052-0-21623","All these years. He kept the body. I came here on the night of the invasion. This is where I died.",""
"115740052-0-21624","This is where I died.",""
"115740052-0-21625","My husband's journal mentions a ritual that brought the Daedra, performed out in the rain. Only a few courtyards on the grounds, so let's seek them out.",""
"115740052-0-21626","Initiates, to the center of the room.",""
"115740052-0-21627","Welcome to the Vault of Shadows.",""
"115740052-0-21628","To begin the initiation phase, we first honor the darkness that shrouds us by dousing these flames.",""
"115740052-0-21629","I will begin.",""
"115740052-0-21630","The battle's on! Hurry! They need you topside!",""
"115740052-0-21631","Gods! That's magefire! Clear the deck!",""
"115740052-0-21632","Ah!",""
"115740052-0-21633","There's that magefire again! Watch out!",""
"115740052-0-21634","Boarders! Quick! Defend the ship!",""
"115740052-0-21635","Another One?",""
"115740052-0-21636","Focus! Let's capture those portals!",""
"115740052-0-21637","It's up to you now—go through and find that bastard Pelidil.",""
"115740052-0-21638","A guardian! Watch out!",""
"115740052-0-21639","Mara's crotch! They've summoned a gods-damned Sea Serpent!",""
"115740052-0-21640","It's spitting poison! Stay clear!",""
"115740052-0-21641","Quickly! To the ballista!",""
"115740052-0-21642","The bedroom is open! Follow as you can!",""
"115740052-0-21643","Stuck him good that time!",""
"115740052-0-21644","Haha! The Serpent-Slayer! You saved the day!",""
"115740052-0-21645","Hurray!",""
"115740052-0-21646","We taught those bastards a lesson, didn't we?",""
"115740052-0-21647","Protect Pelidil!",""
"115740052-0-21648","hear sounds of scuffling in the darkness.",""
"115740052-0-21649","Well, that turned out nicely.",""
"115740052-0-21650","This place is amazing!",""
"115740052-0-21651","Hard to believe it was this simple getting in.",""
"115740052-0-21652","Don't forget all the prep this took. Getting in after all that was easy. Getting through… that may be another story.",""
"115740052-0-21653","What do you think, Rook? Surprised to see us?",""
"115740052-0-21654","We've got to keep moving.",""
"115740052-0-21655","Let's get in the fight.",""
"115740052-0-21656","Simple twin-pressure door lock. Used to install these everywhere, people thought it was magic. Loved watching mages try to ""dispel"" the door. Worked once, that cheater. Anyway, twist the other wheel there. I'll get this one.",""
"115740052-0-21657","Oh, these idiots. Half of these pipes have burst. Of course the pressure lock won't work, now.",""
"115740052-0-21658","Halt! What're you doing here?",""
"115740052-0-21659","That got it! Door's open. Let's move on.",""
"115740052-0-21660","Over there! That pump by the wall.",""
"115740052-0-21661","Let me explain this one. It looks like it still works.",""
"115740052-0-21662","A labyrinth filled with poisonous gas. I need one of these for my home.",""
"115740052-0-21663","Vexa, any ideas how you'd build it? We need to shut it down.",""
"115740052-0-21664","It's elaborate, but if they're taking initiates through here, there's got to be a way to stop it from here.",""
"115740052-0-21665","Ah here it is, let's take a look.",""
"115740052-0-21666","Got it.",""
"115740052-0-21667","Nice move, Vex!",""
"115740052-0-21668","Bad news is, I need to stay here. Looks like I can only close off the gas as long as I keep this pressed down.",""
"115740052-0-21669","I may be able to find a permanent solution, but until then, we don't have the time.",""
"115740052-0-21670","That's ok, Vexa. Once we're safe you can either fix it and catch up, or just head to the rendezvous if it's not working.",""
"115740052-0-21671","Good luck.",""
"115740052-0-21672","We'll see you on the other side, Vexa.",""
"115740052-0-21673","See you at the rendezvous.",""
"115740052-0-21674","This is it!",""
"115740052-0-21675","There's definitely been some changes since I was here last.",""
"115740052-0-21676","This is amazing. Vexa would love it!",""
"115740052-0-21677","There are more panels here like the last room.",""
"115740052-0-21678","I'll try one.",""
"115740052-0-21679","Well that's suspicious. I expected more resistance from the captain. I wonder what's going on here.",""
"115740052-0-21680","This is unsettling. I don't know why they weren't giving us more hassle. Let's just through this as fast as possible.",""
"115740052-0-21681","This is unsettling. The captain seems a little more lax than I expected. Be wary of the guards here. I don't trust this situation at all.",""
"115740052-0-21682","Will you look at that? I think I recognize that guard. Why, yes! It's Marthanas. Oh this should be bloody good. Stay here a moment and lay low. I'll be right back.",""
"115740052-0-21683","Psst! Hey! Marthanas! How's it been, old chum?",""
"115740052-0-21684","Nicolas? What're you doing here? Did the Eyes finally catch you?",""
"115740052-0-21685","Good. We're in. Let's meet with this Captain Shinsun-ra. She can't be too bad. Can she?",""
"115740052-0-21686","We're in. I already feel cramped. Do you see how many people they have imprisoned here? Let's talk to the Captain and get out of here as quick as possible.",""
"115740052-0-21687","We're in. Look at this place. I've never seen a prison this large. Let's move forward and find the Captain. But be on your guard. Who knows what she's like.",""
"115740052-0-21688","Nothing like that. Just some good, old recon, my good friend. Say, can you be a pal and help me out? We need to slip on by and deliver something in the next room. I don't want your friends here to be alarmed, though.",""
"115740052-0-21689","Sure thing Nic. Anything for you. I owe you one after that whole ""human trafficking"" thing, anyway. What do you need me to do?",""
"115740052-0-21690","Oh, you know. Just keep them distracted for a bit while me and my friend here slip on by them. It'll be a quick in and out. The Ring will make sure you are reawrded for your efforts.",""
"115740052-0-21691","Whatever you say. Just be quick about it. I'm got some pull here, but it's hard to control this lot for very long. Good luck.",""
"115740052-0-21692","Good. While Marthanas has everyone disttracted, we can walk right into the next room. Let's get moving.",""
"115740052-0-21693","Attention!Guards of Cell Block 4-B! Form ranks!",""
"115740052-0-21694","Company guards! Time for jumping jacks. Begin now!",""
"115740052-0-21695","Come on, guards! I want to see you sweat!",""
"115740052-0-21696","At ease, guards! Rest for a moment before we begin again.",""
"115740052-0-21697","Guards! Pushups! Now!",""
"115740052-0-21698","Did you see that? The tile raised a column. That's our ticket to the other side.",""
"115740052-0-21699","The jump. No one could make that.",""
"115740052-0-21700","Ha! Obviously, I never told you about this little job I pulled in Stonefalls.",""
"115740052-0-21701","It was just two years ago, and I was after this gem in a volcano. So I —",""
"115740052-0-21702","So you can make the jump?",""
"115740052-0-21703","I can make that jump.",""
"115740052-0-21704","Good. Nicolas and I will raise the columns.",""
"115740052-0-21705","Rook, you're going to be on Winged Twilight duty.",""
"115740052-0-21706","Let's do this!",""
"115740052-0-21707","Here goes nothing!",""
"115740052-0-21708","Move it, Gwen!",""
"115740052-0-21709","Almost there!",""
"115740052-0-21710","Got it!",""
"115740052-0-21711","Piece of cake, right guys?",""
"115740052-0-21712","Easy for you to say. You didn't have Winged Twilights at your throat the whole time.",""
"115740052-0-21713","Gwen, Rook, good job. Now to press on.",""
"115740052-0-21714","This was our bedroom. We used to store our adventuring relics here.",""
"115740052-0-21715","It's warded. Quite a defense for such a small room. There must be a way to open it—and these statues didn't used to be here.",""
"115740052-0-21716","We made it. Almost finished now.",""
"115740052-0-21717","The door straight ahead leads to the vault lower level. That's where I'm going.",""
"115740052-0-21718","Nicolas, you're taking the door on the right and making preparations at the rendezvous.",""
"115740052-0-21719","Hopefully Vexa and Gwen are already there.",""
"115740052-0-21720","Rook, you're taking the door on the left, the vault upper level. Your part is the most important here.",""
"115740052-0-21721","While I steal the key, I need you to get in there and be ready to pull the lever to open the gate.",""
"115740052-0-21722","Once I get my hands on that thing, the entire Lodge is going to come down on us, so we need to get out of here fast.",""
"115740052-0-21723","When I get to the gate you need to open it so I can get through, then I'll seal it from there.",""
"115740052-0-21724","After that we run to the rendezvous and meet up with the others.",""
"115740052-0-21725","Now, any questions?",""
"115740052-0-21726","The tower ahead is not meant for mortal eyes. Turn back, or perish.",""
"115740052-0-21727","There's no ritual site here. Let's keep moving.",""
"115740052-0-21728","You're formidable. Perhaps we have a chance at this. Let me take my students out of the Daedra's reach.",""
"115740052-0-21729","I think you will be most impressed, Emissary. Our little island has many unique and appealing features.",""
"115740052-0-21730","Walk with me, my new friend. Come and taste the sweet fruit that is Cybiades.",""
"115740052-0-21731","You all know my dream of the first pan-Tamrielic Thieves Guild.",""

"115740052-0-21734","We stole from a Daedric Prince! And the skeleton key is ours!",""
"115740052-0-21735","You think we've grown? Just wait until the word travels Tamriel. We'll have new recruits by the dozens.",""
"115740052-0-21736","This is only the beginning my friends!",""
"115740052-0-21737","Today, we tried to steal from a Daedric Prince.",""
"115740052-0-21738","We didn't get what we came for, but we proved ourselves far more capable then I believe anyone realizes.",""
"115740052-0-21739","We stole from the Eyes of the Queen. We broke in AND out of Xarxes Rebuke.",""
"115740052-0-21740","We stole a boat from under the very noses of the Violet Lodge and used their sacred relics to guide us to the Vault of Shadows.",""
"115740052-0-21741","Danni had the key in her hands, but Nocturnal's power was too much. We lost a good leader.",""
"115740052-0-21742","But I don't see this as a failure. We're growing everday and the word is getting out.",""
"115740052-0-21743","The Thieves Guild is already force to be reckoned with, and I intend to keep it that way.",""
"115740052-0-21744","Look at our island, Emissary! Is it not beautiful? Night or day, rain or sun, the isle shines like a beacon on the water.",""

"115740052-0-21747","Look, Nicolas, let me explain…",""
"115740052-0-21748","I'd hoped it wouldn't come up. It's not important.",""
"115740052-0-21749","That hurts, Nick.",""
"115740052-0-21750","I wasn't. I wasn't going to do that, and I wasn't going to tell you. It's. Not. Important.",""
"115740052-0-21751","Yes. I've been trying to escape from my former life for years. It always comes back.",""
"115740052-0-21752","Just… just let him go.",""

"115740052-0-21754","Explain what? How you lied to us about who you really are? Did you think we were stupid?",""
"115740052-0-21755","Oh, no, not important. So the spider tells the fly.",""
"115740052-0-21756","Really? Would you say it hurts more or less than you stabbing us in the back? When were you going to tell us you're a Nocturnal Cultist, Danni? Before or after you sold us out to your god?",""
"115740052-0-21757","Fine, you keep saying that. Hopefully someone will believe you. I'm done.",""
"115740052-0-21758","Danni, is what he said true?",""
"115740052-0-21759","Why didn't you say something? You've got to get Nick back! We need him!",""

"115740052-0-21761","Ho there, watchwoman! This is the emissary of our King Faharajad. It's a pleasure just to feel the reflected light of His Majesty, is it not?",""
"115740052-0-21762","Ah, yes. Yes it is. My respects to His Majesty, emissary.",""
"115740052-0-21763","And where do you think you're going?",""
"115740052-0-21764","None can escape my prison of Coldharbour!",""

"115740052-0-21770","Well done, mortals. But this is the realm of death itself. The armies of unlife are endless!",""
"115740052-0-21771","Your mortal magic will not save you, ""Prophet."" You cannot escape.",""
"115740052-0-21772","What? What is happening?",""
"115740052-0-21773","No! You will not escape. Coldharbour does not release its grasp!",""
"115740052-0-21774","Raaaaaaaaaahhhhh!",""
"115740052-0-21775","You have a token? Put it in the box, please.",""
"115740052-0-21776","Very good. Follow me, please.",""
"115740052-0-21777","It's me, Nicolas. Quick, come here, before anyone gets here.",""
"115740052-0-21778","Another group enters the Arena! Are they brave or foolish? Perhaps a bit of both? Step forward and let's find out, shall we?",""
"115740052-0-21779","We have new challengers! Will they survive the competition, or will their blood decorate the floor of our grand Arena?",""
"115740052-0-21780","Blah blah",""
"115740052-0-21781","It's like … it's like a fog has lifted from inside my mind. Adept, I don't know what to say. You've saved me from a fate worse than death.",""
"115740052-0-21782","Hmm? What's going on over there?",""
"115740052-0-21783","Guards! What is the meaning of this?",""
"115740052-0-21784","Emissary, I can assure you … this is not the norm under my watch. These guards will be severely punished! Come, let us keep walking. Let us put these fools behind us.",""
"115740052-0-21785","Ready or not, the battle is about to begin! For those of you who bet gold on the newcomers, you have my sympathy.",""
"115740052-0-21786","You drunkards! Cease this immediately! Return to the barracks!",""
"115740052-0-21787","Ahem. Moving on. As you can see, we've built a great deal here in just a short amount of time.",""
"115740052-0-21788","These houses are constructed so well … all for future luminaries of the Covenant. Or associates of our Headman Cosh. But in the meantime, we allow our well-paid workers to live in these fine buildings.",""

"115740052-0-21792","Please excuse me. I must consult with my advisors about this omen.",""
"115740052-0-21793","I shall return!",""
"115740052-0-21794","Gwen, hurry! Let's get this done, fast!",""
"115740052-0-21795","Do you have the decoy?",""
"115740052-0-21796","I know you're too professional to tell me how to do a job I've done countless times before, Nick. What was it you were asking me?",""
"115740052-0-21797","Nothing, Gwen. Nevermind. I'll watch the door.",""
"115740052-0-21798","You do that, sugarcup. Maybe go see if there's anything in his strongroom to steal. This could take a minute or two.",""
"115740052-0-21799","There. Got it! Take care, you two. I'm getting this to safety.",""
"115740052-0-21800","My … my lord Takheem! What's wrong?",""
"115740052-0-21801","I'll tell you what's wrong, Banu! My pendant is gone! The Eye of Isari! It's been in my family for generations! Thieves are running rampant in your town, Magistrate. What are you going to do about it?",""
"115740052-0-21802","A thousand pardons, my lord! I will look into it personally. I'll speak with Captain Addin. Rest assured, your pendant will be returned quickly.",""
"115740052-0-21803","Open the gate! And let the guar know that fresh meat will be available shortly!",""
"115740052-0-21804","You had better, Banu. Or Headman Cosh will hear of this.",""
"115740052-0-21805","Emissary, a thousand pardons to you. I wished only to show you the best of Abah's Landing, and you have seen but the worst. Let us cut this short, for now.",""
"115740052-0-21806","If you would, return to my manse. I will confer with Captain Addin about the situation, and see to you as soon as I can. Ask one of my servants to serve you my favorite Alik'r vintage. Blessings of Tall Papa be upon you, Emissary.",""
"115740052-0-21807","Addin will pay for this. I'll not look the fool in front of Cosh.",""
"115740052-0-21808","You're doing this on purpose, aren't you? Bastards!",""
"115740052-0-21809","Hey there, good looking. Ann sends her regards.",""
"115740052-0-21810","Good luck in there.",""
"115740052-0-21811","Let loose the combatants! This is the Dragonstar Arena, and the games have begun!",""
"115740052-0-21812","Emissary! I have returned. Come, we must speak.",""
"115740052-0-21813","Awww, our heroic warriors have been defeated. Better brush yourself off and get back up, our challengers will be back in just a moment.",""
"115740052-0-21814","Too late, fool. The Arena will run slick with blood!",""
"115740052-0-21816","It looks like we've stopped them for now. Take a breather, shore up our defenses!",""
"115740052-0-21817","Thanks, Nicolas. For coming.",""
"115740052-0-21818","What are old friends for?",""
"115740052-0-21819","Bring in the next sacrifice!",""
"115740052-0-21820","Aha! Fresh blood! Welcome, victim. Welcome to the arena!",""
"115740052-0-21821","Such brutality, such strength! Very impressive. But just wait!",""
"115740052-0-21822","You're still alive? What a treat! Finally, worthy foes to rend!",""
"115740052-0-21823","Good to see you too,Numih. Try not to let the grape go to your head.",""
"115740052-0-21824","I think you're right, Tasaba. The new fish is just what we've been looking for.",""
"115740052-0-21825","Leave the students be! I'm the one you want!",""
"115740052-0-21826","I wish I could be there to see that little toad dancing with the snake.",""
"115740052-0-21827","Stay out of sight. Watch this.",""
"115740052-0-21828","You are not yourself, Nerien'eth—let me help you.",""
"115740052-0-21829","Wait!",""
"115740052-0-21830","Keep watch. I just need to change some flows here.",""
"115740052-0-21831","She should be back by now. Do you think she caught on?",""
"115740052-0-21832","I've been staring up at that Hall, my friend. Staring, and plotting, and planning. And you know what I've decided?",""
"115740052-0-21833","Just be patient. The woman and the servant can't hide in there forever.",""
"115740052-0-21834","Wait. Did anyone else hear something?",""
"115740052-0-21835","There. Who's trapped, now?",""
"115740052-0-21836","It's time. It's time I get back what was taken from me. Get back at those that did me wrong. Banu's a good start, I'd say.",""
"115740052-0-21837","That blasted cult is on my bad side. Did you know they were going to come after me?",""
"115740052-0-21838","I suspected they might, but not so soon. We'll have to act against them sooner.",""
"115740052-0-21839","See that we do. You hit them hard, I'll do this work for no more than my cut. They made this personal.",""
"115740052-0-21840","One of the greatest monuments ever built to honor Nocturnal.",""
"115740052-0-21841","And remember, this is a place of honor and respect.",""
"115740052-0-21842","We made it.",""
"115740052-0-21843","Thanks to Vexa.",""
"115740052-0-21844","I never imagined this place would so intriguing.",""
"115740052-0-21845","Getting a little warm in here.",""
"115740052-0-21846","More than a little ….",""
"115740052-0-21847","Find a way through these cultists, Rook. We're on our own here.",""
"115740052-0-21848","Head to the entrance to the inner sanctum on far side of the area.",""
"115740052-0-21849","See you in the Inner Sanctum!",""
"115740052-0-21850","And good luck.",""
"115740052-0-21851","So here's what you're going to do. Tasaba's put together a little folio of papers outlining our plot. Entirely forged, of course. She's good at that.",""
"115740052-0-21852","Instead of you and I, Banu is the one behind everything. He's the one who had the emissary poisioned, he's the one behind Whitemane's death. This sheaf of papers will …..",""
"115740052-0-21853","Captain! Captain, she's free. The emissary is free!",""
"115740052-0-21854","Damn that woman, and her steel stomach. She's sure to spoil the game with the Magistrate if we don't stop her. Hmm. Numih, do we still have that watch uniform?",""
"115740052-0-21855","Yeah. It's downstairs with the folio for Banu. What are you thinking, Captain?",""
"115740052-0-21856","Oh, thanks, mate. I appreciate the kind gesture. But really, it wasn't necessary.",""
"115740052-0-21857","We can use this to our advantage. We'll get the emissary involved, and yoke this anchor around Banu's neck all the tighter.",""
"115740052-0-21858","Numih, I want you to head back up to the Magistrate's Hall. Hide at the back gate, and wait for our friend here. You'll be our bruiser on this.",""
"115740052-0-21859","Aye, Captain!",""
"115740052-0-21860","Heh, damn right I am.",""
"115740052-0-21861","This way! Whatever he keeps in here now, it's well-guarded.",""
"115740052-0-21862","Back to you, my friend. Head down to the bar, grab the folio and uniform. Find Numih at the back gate to the Magistrate's Hall.",""
"115740052-0-21863","Slip inside the Hall and listen in on Banu's conversation with the emissary. We need to know what she knows. Then, get Banu alone. Escort him out to Numih, who will bring him back here.",""
"115740052-0-21864","We're so close. I can almost taste it! Good luck up there. Don't let the crew down.",""
"115740052-0-21865","NoSound",""
"115740052-0-21866","Leave those souls—kill the intruders!",""
"115740052-0-21867","Please, I'm begging you. I'll do all the black sacraments you want if you'll just spare my life.",""
"115740052-0-21868","Think of it, just one life in exchange for many!",""
"115740052-0-21869","An interesting offer, don't you think, Varn?",""
"115740052-0-21870","Of course I think, but do I agree? The contract is sacred. It must be fulfilled.",""
"115740052-0-21871","But the black sacrament honors Sithis. To honor him comes first and foremost.",""
"115740052-0-21872","Perhaps our newly arrived brother should decide.",""
"115740052-0-21873","Yes, perhaps.",""
"115740052-0-21874","Well that's not good. They closed the door behind us, and the lever to open it's on the other side. Looks like we'll have to go around the long way.",""
"115740052-0-21875","Gods be damned! The door's closed. And we can't open it from this side. We've got to go the other way.",""
"115740052-0-21876","Rats. They closed the door behind us. We can't go through that way. But not to worry, I think I know a way around. Let's keep going and I'll show you.",""
"115740052-0-21877","You're doing a great job rescuing me so far, love. I feel safer already!",""
"115740052-0-21878","Tell me, my dear liberator, where do we go from here?",""
"115740052-0-21879","What's that way?",""
"115740052-0-21880","That's… they call it ""the Lake."" It's one of their ""interrogation rooms."" They focus on water torture there. Let's not go there. I have… bad memories of it. Besides, it's a dead end.",""
"115740052-0-21881","Perfect. If there's water, then there's a sewer nearby. There shouldn't be any guards down there. So let's call it a shortcut.",""
"115740052-0-21882","And… there. That should do it. Keep your head low. Let's find the sewer entrance in here. Unless you want to try your luck with the guards.",""
"115740052-0-21883","You'd better be right about this, Danni. I hope this is the last time I have to go into this room.",""
"115740052-0-21885","There she is! Gwenneth! Hello! Are you well?",""
"115740052-0-21886","Vexa? I'll be damned! What're you doing in this lovely little place? And who's your friend?",""
"115740052-0-21887","I'm here to free you. And the Rook is here to help. Now give me a minute while I figure out this contraption.",""
"115740052-0-21888","Take your time! I'll just be sitting here, rotting in my jail cell. Can you believe the trouble they went through to lock me up? Special cage and everything!",""
"115740052-0-21889","Yes, yes, aren't you special. And that should do it. Rook, hit this switch, would you? That should open Gwen's cage.",""
"115740052-0-21890","According to Danni's briefing, we're getting close. Let's keep our eyes out for the guards and find Gwenneth.",""
"115740052-0-21891","We're close now. If I remember correctly,, Gwenneth's cell is in the next room. Let's stay sharp and look for a way into her cell.",""
"115740052-0-21892","We're close. One more room to go. Keep an eye on those guards. Let's find a way to get to her cell.",""
"115740052-0-21894","Gwen's cell should be through that door. We need to push that lever to open it, though.",""
"115740052-0-21895","I'm right here. Just bring the bastard out and I'll get him back to Ann.",""
"115740052-0-21896","Hey! Who opened the gate?",""
"115740052-0-21897","I refuse to be troll food, you—wait, you're not an Iron Orc! You've got to help us! The Butcher is feeding our people to his trolls!",""
"115740052-0-21898","You idiot! What good is that rice you just dropped a torch on? You think rice just… sprouts from the ground for us to eat?",""
"115740052-0-21899","Uh, Captain, rice actually—",""
"115740052-0-21900","Did I just hear you backtalk me, Marganus? That rice is your meal tonight, now. The others will make sure you eat every bite. Get cleaning, idiot!",""
"115740052-0-21901","Yes, Captain Tullia.",""
"115740052-0-21902","When you're done, find out why in blazes the cargo from the ship isn't here yet. You should be able to handle messenger duty, at least. Just have them write things down, don't try to remember it.",""
"115740052-0-21903","Banu, you incompetent lapdog! Do you have any idea what I've been through?",""
"115740052-0-21904","Your grace, it's as I said. I'm very sorry about what has happened. They had the official seal, just as was described in the letters. I had no way of knowing you had been waylaid!",""
"115740052-0-21905","I will accept no excuses! The King will accept no excuses! This … assault on my person is part of a plot. I know it. Who is behind it?",""
"115740052-0-21906","I don't … I don't have an answer for you, Emissary.",""
"115740052-0-21907","I can assure you. I will find the one responsible. I will uncover the plot you speak of. I swear on my loyalty to the King!",""
"115740052-0-21908","Banu … why should I believe you? How do I know you aren't the one behind this?",""
"115740052-0-21909","Marganus called the sacrament! Kill him and we anger Sithis.",""
"115740052-0-21910","We anger Sithis if we spare him! ""Kill everyone"" means kill … every … one. He dies.",""
"115740052-0-21911","You trumped up pirates, with your lavish pillows and your hookahs.",""
"115740052-0-21912","No! Please!",""
"115740052-0-21913","I have … I have proof. I can show you …",""
"115740052-0-21914","Shut your mouth, dog! That was not a question. This is a situation that must be resolved. I will see to it … personally.",""
"115740052-0-21915","Captain Addin is an old friend of mine. I'm certain he'll have insights into how to proceed.",""
"115740052-0-21916","The Iron Orcs … the Butcher - they're feeding people to trolls! You've got the help!",""
"115740052-0-21917","This is an impasse. Let the new blood tilt the scales.",""
"115740052-0-21918","The new blood?",""
"115740052-0-21919","Freshly marked as a dark initiate. Sithis works through them.",""
"115740052-0-21920","Hm. Yes. On that we can agree.",""
"115740052-0-21921","Hey, new blood! Varn and I are leaving. Decide if this fool lives or dies, and meet us outside.",""
"115740052-0-21922","Banu … why should I believe you? How do I know you aren't the one behind this?",""

"115740052-0-22132","The Apex Stone! It's sealed the Serpent away!",""
"115740052-0-22133","Come, follow me. I'll show you around and take you to the Listener. He's in charge around here. But first, let's meet some of the crew.",""
"115740052-0-22134","Over here's our docks. Bronric is our boatman. Say hello to your newest member, Bronric.",""
"115740052-0-22135","Nice to meet you!",""
"115740052-0-22136","Don't mind him. He's a little funny in the head. Now, let's get you over to the Listener. He's in the West Wing. Follow me.",""
"115740052-0-22137","We use thi shall for most of our gatherings. You're free to come and go as you please, of course.",""
"115740052-0-22138","You hurt the pet, now you face the master!",""
"115740052-0-22139","As yo ucan see we have plenty of ""persuasion parlors"" for you to use if your contract is a little tight-lipped. Not everyone fancies their use, but I think it can be a good way to relax before a big contract.",""
"115740052-0-22140","And here we are. The Listener is in the tabernacle with the Night Mother's coffin. He'd like to speak with you to officially welcome you to the family. Good luck.",""
"115740052-0-22141","Come here, my child. Let us talk.",""
"115740052-0-22142","What is this strange stone?",""
"115740052-0-22143","Seek the key.",""
"115740052-0-22144","Enter the passage. Enter … and find me.",""
"115740052-0-22145","Witness, child. Your eyes gaze up on a maddness unbeknownst to the Brotherhood.",""
"115740052-0-22146","The madness of one torn in two.",""
"115740052-0-22147","Do you see the truth now?",""
"115740052-0-22148","Then Abnur himself believes it can be done. This is very welcome news.",""
"115740052-0-22149","Banish that thought from your mind, Your Grace. Among the Tharns, you and you alone have my heart. Upon my honor, our two paths are one.",""
"115740052-0-22150","He does. Though I must say I'm a little offended. My support is not enough for you? The support of the Rimmen Queen is insufficient?",""
"115740052-0-22151","Hmph. See that it remains that way. You heart may well be coated in gold, for all the coin I have spent.",""
"115740052-0-22152","Do not worry, my dear. I will admit the loss of my agent there is … frustrating. But I see frustrations not as setbacks, but opportunities.",""
"115740052-0-22153","Your Grace, I will remind you who placed you in your position in the first place. Your family may weave webs across Tamriel, but I am the one holding the threads.",""
"115740052-0-22154","And what of your designs on the Khajiit? You understand I have a sizeable investment in Elsweyr already?",""
"115740052-0-22155","I want your plot resolved by the end of the year, then. My plans in the region are very specific, and I cannot abide meddling.",""
"115740052-0-22156","I trust my agents have proven themselves useful, Your Grace?",""
"115740052-0-22157","Your Grace, I stole nothing. When the old Empire fell, I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.",""
"115740052-0-22158","Yes, yes. This Lodge you're so proud of appears to be quite capable. The fact that you stole your network from the Empire makes it all the more impressive.",""
"115740052-0-22159","So you say, Headman. So you say. Just know that the remains of the ""old Empire"" you speak of are still very much alive. And know where you live.",""
"115740052-0-22160","Well, you certainly don't look like the typical Serpent cultists.",""
"115740052-0-22161","I wasn't brave enough to stand up to the Scaled Court. And because of that, Craglorn is doomed.",""
"115740052-0-22162","Darkness rises when silence dies … darkness rises when silence dies ….",""
"115740052-0-22163","She's gone, old fool. Those words mean nothing.",""
"115740052-0-22164","We must have faith.",""
"115740052-0-22165","Our faith should be in Sithis, not a corpse in a fancy bucket.",""
"115740052-0-22166","Our plan won't work. This is blasphemy.",""
"115740052-0-22167","It's necessity. If she won't do her job, we'll do it for her.",""
"115740052-0-22168","There's still time. If she would speak with me—",""
"115740052-0-22169","We both know that won't happen. Hurry, there's little time.",""
"115740052-0-22170","What will become of the Brotherhood?",""
"115740052-0-22171","They'll learn to follow the Night Father. Those who don't, we send to the Void.",""
"115740052-0-22172","All right, if it must be done. We should prepare the coffin for our becoming.",""
"115740052-0-22173","Good. Let's give the old girl her send-off.",""
"115740052-0-22174","Sithis' touch is never kind. Some endure it … others crack beneath the strain, like a mirror in a tightly bound frame.",""
"115740052-0-22175","You're saying … the Wrath is crazy?",""
"115740052-0-22176","The Wrath can only rest with the Night Mother's destruction. Do you understand now?",""
"115740052-0-22177","But why would the Wrath harm the Night Mother? I don't understand!",""
"115740052-0-22178","Yes, Listener.",""
"115740052-0-22179","Then check the lower passage, and be vigilant. If the Wrath makes it inside, the Night Mother is lost.",""
"115740052-0-22180","Hail Sithis!",""
"115740052-0-22181","But his attention will wander elsewhere. We should depart.",""
"115740052-0-22182","I have explained myself well, I hope? You will stop for nothing, pause for nothing?",""
"115740052-0-22183","Yes, Magistrate. I must make for Cosh Hall at once, and deliver your missive directly to his seneschal.",""
"115740052-0-22184","You have the right of it. There has been some kind of horrible mistake, it must be corrected. My letter must reach the Headman as soon as possible. Tall Papa keep you safe, my dear.",""
"115740052-0-22185","Thy will be done, Magistrate Banu.",""
"115740052-0-22186","Here I am, my friends!",""
"115740052-0-22187","Hmph. Yeah, ""thy will be done"". Pompous windbag.",""
"115740052-0-22188","Hmm. I bet I have time for a mug before he'll expect me back. Magistrate Banu's a patient man.",""
"115740052-0-22189","No! She must burn again, she must ….",""
"115740052-0-22190","My child, what are you doing here?",""
"115740052-0-22191","The Celestial Guardians will not save you from me. They won't stop what's coming.",""
"115740052-0-22192","Ah, child. You held such promise.",""
"115740052-0-22193","Rise, face me, one final time.",""
"115740052-0-22194","Mother, I see clearly now, for the first time in years. I have failed you, nearly done the unthinkable! I have nearly brought ruin to the Brotherhood.",""
"115740052-0-22195","Ssh. Quiet now, child. The Void will bring you the silence you crave.",""
"115740052-0-22196","Come, Listener. I must speak with you.",""
"115740052-0-22197","SCREEECH!!!",""
"115740052-0-22198","It is done.",""
"115740052-0-22199","The Serpent could not break this new seal with the blood of a thousand mortals. He will never return to this plane.",""
"115740052-0-22200","Even the two of us could not break this new seal on the Stone. The Serpent will never enter this plane, again. Let us depart—the Mage remains in the Serpent's thrall.",""
"115740052-0-22201","No job is worth this.",""
"115740052-0-22202","I can't wait for tomorrow!",""
"115740052-0-22203","I can already see my crown!",""
"115740052-0-22204","The Warrior remains in his thrall. Even alone, that one will cause untold peril if left unchecked.",""
"115740052-0-22205","Serpent! I've ensured you will never return to this plane. When the Mage and the Warrior are freed from your influence, you will answer for their entrapment.",""
"115740052-0-22206","Darkness rises when silence dies… I must return to Void's Embrace.",""
"115740052-0-22207","I can hear her voice. I must return to Void's Embrace, there is much to be done.",""
"115740052-0-22208","These Iron Orcs are no fun at all! I had such high hopes for the diplomatic method.",""
"115740052-0-22209","I wonder if they've joined the Scaled Court.",""
"115740052-0-22210","I'll make a bow out of your spine and string it with your guts!",""
"115740052-0-22211","We are here, Wrath.",""
"115740052-0-22212","Protect the Night Mother!",""
"115740052-0-22213","It is not alone!",""
"115740052-0-22214","She is coming! Flee!",""
"115740052-0-22215","They flee like frightened echateres!",""
"115740052-0-22216","Listen!",""
"115740052-0-22217","This is what she deserves!",""
"115740052-0-22218","She burns again now!",""
"115740052-0-22219","You must let this happen!",""
"115740052-0-22220","You really showed up! Of course you did. I know how to pick them.",""
"115740052-0-22221","You dare to go on? This pleases my master. Let's hope you continue to please her and she grants you the strength to survive the coming battles.",""
"115740052-0-22222","You can always learn something from the entrails of a kill. Let's cut this trainer open and learn something.",""
"115740052-0-22223","Prepare your weapons. Ready your spells. Oh, and you may want to put on something warm. It's about to get cold in here.",""
"115740052-0-22224","d",""
"115740052-0-22225","Do try not to soil anything during this battle.",""
"115740052-0-22226","To advance, you must defeat the champions of this arena—Nords from the coldest region of Skyrim! They love the thrill of battle, the conquest of their enemies, and the taste of mead! But not necessarily in that order.",""
"115740052-0-22227","The ferocity in your blood melts the bitter cold of this arena! Well done, mortals! Head through the gate when you're ready. There are many more versions of the Arena waiting to be conquered.",""
"115740052-0-22228","Hey there fish. Put the uniforms on the counter, and we'll talk.",""
"115740052-0-22229","Heh, good work. You continue to surprise me.",""
"115740052-0-22230","Here's how it's going to go. Cosh sent us to have a little talk to the Magistrate, right?",""
"115740052-0-22231","Tasaba and I will go in hard, like we're ready to beat the snob out of him. That's where you come in.",""
"115740052-0-22232","He means that literally. We want you to come running in to Banu's rescue. We'll leave, and you can help the Magistrate recover his dignity.",""
"115740052-0-22233","We'll see you at the Manor, fish.",""
"115740052-0-22234","Please! Have mercy!",""
"115740052-0-22235","You've angered the Headman, Banu! You've crossed him for the last time!",""
"115740052-0-22236","Please gather near the pyre. We're ready to start the funeral.",""
"115740052-0-22237","What did I do? I have only ever served the Headman faithfully!",""
"115740052-0-22238","That's not what Cosh said, Magistrate! The way we hear it …",""
"115740052-0-22239","Hold your tongue. We appear to have company.",""
"115740052-0-22240","Some people would try to find a little heat when the weather turns so chilly. But perhaps freezing to death is part of a strategy I'm just not familiar with.",""
"115740052-0-22241","Emissary! Tall Papa be praised! These ruffians have knocked out my guards! They are here to ruin me!",""
"115740052-0-22242","You're a lucky man, Banu. Keep a blade handy. We'll be back.",""
"115740052-0-22243","Yes. Remember us, Magistrate. Cosh always pays his debts.",""
"115740052-0-22244","Aww, the fires went out. Well that's going to make things difficult. Better find a way to get those things back on.",""
"115740052-0-22245","Now that just looks cold out there. Bet it feels even worse.",""
"115740052-0-22246","The trolls! Always forget about the trolls. How the Nords hooked up with those ferocious creatures is beyond me, but their always good for a few bites!",""
"115740052-0-22247","Every victory elevates you in the eyes of the master, mortals. But how will you fare in the marsh? Can you handle the mud and the bugs and the creatures intent on eating you once they defeat you?",""
"115740052-0-22248","Safa sends more pawns? Very well. Feel the bite of the true Serpent!",""
"115740052-0-22249","Probably your toughest opponent in the marsh will be the Nereids. Feisty little darlings! They hate being here and will most definitely take out that hatred on you.",""
"115740052-0-22250","Enough with the commentary. Let's get this battle started!",""
"115740052-0-22251","What do you seek, little rat? Don't you fear the Serpent's sharp tooth?",""
"115740052-0-22252","The foul mongrels from the Reach certainly know how to put up a fight. Their magic is strange, their ways are strange, but I love the amount of harm they can inflict when they put their minds to it.",""
"115740052-0-22253","Another win, another step closer to a personal audience with my master. Now, through the gate! There's more fun waiting for you in the next arena.",""
"115740052-0-22254","Who dares interrupt—? Damn you, Safa! Can I never be free of your fangs?",""
"115740052-0-22255","We must shed Satakal's old skin, brothers and sisters. Only then can we know the true Serpent. Together we will make this leap of faith!",""
"115740052-0-22256","Yes, yes. I see it now. The true Serpent has opened my eyes. Arise, my slave!",""
"115740052-0-22257","The Serpent welcomes you into the fold, Mazaluhad. I trust you brought more recruits?",""
"115740052-0-22258","As we agreed. Safa will be furious, but these disciples are yours to command.",""
"115740052-0-22259","Cassipia! I mean, Exalted Viper! Let me see you, my love!",""
"115740052-0-22260","Cassi … I'm sorry … my love ….",""
"115740052-0-22261","No… No! Little Leaf!",""
"115740052-0-22262","You won't leave Sanctum Ophidia alive!",""
"115740052-0-22263","I will not be contained! Do you understand me? Not by the Celestial Guardians. Not by you.",""
"115740052-0-22264","No! Not Little Leaf!",""
"115740052-0-22265","The Lass, eh? Truly a hole in the fabric of my beloved Covenant. Come with me, I shall walk you out.",""
"115740052-0-22266","I will take Addin, and we will gather guards from his garrison. Together, we will descend on the Lass and take this … traitor into custody.",""
"115740052-0-22267","I would ask you make for this tavern. Stay with the traitor, and ensure they do not leave. Addin and I will not be far behind. And then all of this … unpleasantness can be brought to an end.",""
"115740052-0-22268","Indeed. We will meet you there in force. Go well … and say nothing to the traitorous dogs that lair in that tavern.",""
"115740052-0-22269","Hey there fish. We have Banu all trussed up and ready for his big day, down Below Decks. Follow me.",""
"115740052-0-22270","This place holds nothing for you but death.",""
"115740052-0-22271","Flee or be slain by the guardians of the honorable dead!",""
"115740052-0-22272","I tire of this. You will never leave the inner sanctum alive!",""
"115740052-0-22273","Destroy them.",""
"115740052-0-22274","The dishonor ends here.",""
"115740052-0-22275","Repel the invaders!",""
"115740052-0-22277","The Serpent wants to return the world to a more primitive state. Once I discovered that, I knew I had to oppose him.",""
"115740052-0-22278","Let's finish this grim business. Then I'll have one less thing to worry about as I work to break the Serpent's hold.",""
"115740052-0-22279","It seems the Game Master is slain, so entertainment must be temporarily suspended. nnSurvivors may go, but are encouraged to stay. Those who leave will be rounded up later.",""
"115740052-0-22280","By the Eight! I thought that was the end!",""
"115740052-0-22282","Then let us depart.",""
"115740052-0-22283","It always smells like rotten mudcrabs around here.",""
"115740052-0-22284","Mortals. More of you.",""
"115740052-0-22285","Your townships embalm the world like a foul crust.",""
"115740052-0-22286","Nirn will begin anew when I escape this prison, escape Craglorn.",""
"115740052-0-22287","You won't stop what's coming! No one will!",""
"115740052-0-22288","Allow me to show you a vision of the inevitable.",""
"115740052-0-22289","When I've ground the armies of Men and Mer to dust, this land will return to its rightful state—to all that you see.",""
"115740052-0-22290","Under my guidance, the jungles will reclaim your shining cities.",""
"115740052-0-22291","That Mantikora was a mortal construction—puny in the grand scheme.",""
"115740052-0-22292","You escaped with your lives against the Mantikora. Why persist?",""
"115740052-0-22293","Your end is imminent. The Stonebreaker will show you.",""
"115740052-0-22295","I see troll blood has thinned in the modern era. You will die for this! I promise you!",""
"115740052-0-22296","Present yourself, Regent Boward. The mantikora project is at an end.",""
"115740052-0-22297","Regent Cassipia? What is the meaning of this?",""
"115740052-0-22298","Watch your tone, regent! Your abomination is dead. Will you abandon the Serpent and join me?",""
"115740052-0-22299","Abandon the Serpent? I would never do that!",""
"115740052-0-22300","Very well, Boward. Join your abomination in Oblivion!",""
"115740052-0-22301","Boward gave me no choice. My actions must remain secret. Come talk to me after you free the prisoners.",""
"115740052-0-22302","Assume anyone from town is a rival gang.",""
"115740052-0-22303","By the Three, I thought I was done for!",""
"115740052-0-22304","They were going to toss us in that disgusting pool with that horrible beast! Thank you for rescuing us!",""
"115740052-0-22305","This one is very happy not to be dead right now.",""
"115740052-0-22306","That's the last time I accept an invitation from a mysterious robed figure. Thanks for setting us free!",""
"115740052-0-22307","Time to die!",""
"115740052-0-22308","The trolls have proved useful indeed, Akkra. But are you sure this taskmaster of yours can keep them at heel?",""
"115740052-0-22309","Zagrakh will not disappoint. Just be sure your master remembers his end of the bargain. When all this is over, these lands are ours again. As they should be.",""
"115740052-0-22310","Wait. Did you hear that? Ready your spells. We may have some pests to deal with.",""
"115740052-0-22311","Cassipia has betrayed us. Protect the progenitor, whatever the cost!",""
"115740052-0-22312","Look how they blindly follow the Serpent's orders. His venomous lies have poisoned their minds.",""
"115740052-0-22313","The scorpion matron's den should be nearby. Prepare yourself. The matron and her brood will be deadly opponents.",""
"115740052-0-22314","Their forward march persists! Alert the others!",""
"115740052-0-22315","Just where I'd expect to find you, Banu. A squalid rat hole, damp and decaying.",""
"115740052-0-22316","Meet me near Dragonstar after you deal with the wamasu. Its den is close by.",""
"115740052-0-22317","Captain Ann. I'm not surprised to find you here. You've been looking for a way to earn Banu's favor since you landed.",""
"115740052-0-22318","I'm sure you're starting to wonder what's going on in here. You'll come to understand—provided you survive!",""
"115740052-0-22319","And now for something a little different. Direct from the lands of the Dark Elves, allow me to present—the slavers of House Dres! Don't let them get their chains on you ….",""
"115740052-0-22320","Ah, here they come now.",""
"115740052-0-22321","Let's shout ""huzzah!"" for the champions of House Dres! Such grace. Such agility. Think of the pain they're about to inflict! Magnificent!",""
"115740052-0-22322","Well, you know what they say about House Dres? The only way to change a slaver's mind is to drive a sword through it! Ha! That's another victory for the newcomers.",""
"115740052-0-22323","I desire the favor of no one, Captain. I grew tired of your incompetence. This dog was angling for Cosh. What do you think would have happened to me if Banu sat in the Headman's hall?",""
"115740052-0-22324","No! Captain, Emissary! These are lies. I would never do what she says!",""
"115740052-0-22325","I've heard enough lies for a lifetime! I have seen the proof of your treachery. Be silent, or your fate is certain.",""

"115740052-0-22523","You seek to put an end to Kulth? Kulth does not think that will work out well for you.",""
"115740052-0-22524","You won't stop our army! You can't!",""
"115740052-0-22525","It seeks to test my weapons? My armor? The audacity!",""
"115740052-0-22526","Too late, little goats, too late. The prepared trolls have already been sent to the Exarch.",""
"115740052-0-22527","I am the Exalted Viper! I shall not be denied my place in the sky!",""
"115740052-0-22528","Regent Cassipia! You must not continue upon this dangerous path.",""
"115740052-0-22529","No! You don't understand! Leave us alone and everything will be fine.",""
"115740052-0-22530","I won't let you hurt my Cassi!",""
"115740052-0-22531","Come back to me, Little Leaf.",""
"115740052-0-22532","I only sought … to make things … better ….",""
"115740052-0-22533","Pause a moment, champion. I bring word from the great warrior.",""
"115740052-0-22534","Take up my blade, Titus Valerius. You have earned it. Let its might flow through you and remind you who and what you are—a warrior true!",""
"115740052-0-22535","Kulth eats Wood Elves! Well, that's what I heard. We have to stop him from inscribing trolls with nirncrux.",""
"115740052-0-22536","This nirncrux armor is tricky stuff. Without the armorer, the Iron Orcs won't be able to dress up their troll army.",""
"115740052-0-22537","Don't let them interrupt the process!",""
"115740052-0-22538","Moloch's eye! The armor is nearly complete. Kill these fools for interrupting.",""
"115740052-0-22540","Be careful! The Gate's been open for some time. The forest is probably crawling with Daedra!",""
"115740052-0-22541","There you are! The gate is just up ahead. Those three in front of it look … formidable.",""
"115740052-0-22542","Quiet, you! It's been a bad day!",""
"115740052-0-22543","Confound it. Where could that Bosmeri woman have gone off to?",""
"115740052-0-22544","I feel stronger. My memories return! Celestial Warrior, hear me! I have done all you have demanded. I have served faithfully. Now, please, send me home.",""
"115740052-0-22545","My comrades! My friends. Never have I fought beside more noble heroes. This may be farewell, but I will not forget you. Fight on, and never let your values falter. With you, I know the future is in capable hands.",""
"115740052-0-22546","Larisa … beloved. My part in this war is over. I'm coming home.",""
"115740052-0-22547","You are my champion, Titus, in whom I am well pleased. Hold tightly to the blade. It will travel with you and serve you well in your own time.",""
"115740052-0-22548","Do not fear. The story of Titus Valerius recounts one of the greatest warriors to ever walk the surface of Tamriel. His achievements echo even into the future. Perhaps the same will be true of you.",""
"115740052-0-22549","You're here! Let's go. We have to destroy the Sigil Stone in order to close the Oblivion Gate for good. Gilraen says the <<1>> guards it.",""
"115740052-0-22550","You forced my hand! We're going to smash you, and then the Sigil Stone.",""
"115740052-0-22551","I'll distract him. Fingaenion, you stay here!",""
"115740052-0-22552","When you're ready, meet me at the blacksmithing station.",""
"115740052-0-22553","Be careful! The Gate's been open for some time. The forest is probably crawling with Daedra!",""
"115740052-0-22554","Gilraen, don't you dare die on me now! Be careful!",""
"115740052-0-22555","You did it, the bridge is assembling!",""
"115740052-0-22556","You don't have to come down here for me to hurt you.",""
"115740052-0-22557","No! Fingaenion!",""
"115740052-0-22558","Tear his heart out! I'll tend to my husband.",""
"115740052-0-22559","You beat the Valkyn? Remind me never to anger you.",""
"115740052-0-22560","Is that the Stone up ahead?",""
"115740052-0-22561","It is.",""
"115740052-0-22562","Can't believe this is over. I'm glad you're safe.",""
"115740052-0-22563","I don't know if any of us are safe. What happened today—this might not be over at all.",""
"115740052-0-22564","I know so. I know it in my heart.",""
"115740052-0-22565","Ever the optimist. I'm glad you're here, Fin.",""
"115740052-0-22566","I never expected to be back. Oblivion had become home.",""
"115740052-0-22567","We can go anywhere you want. Just say the word.",""
"115740052-0-22568","We were involved in the death of a Valkyn. This ordeal may not be over, Fin.",""
"115740052-0-22569","Try to put it out of your mind. We won't be near any Oblivion Gates for a while.",""
"115740052-0-22570","Fingaenion? Dammit—hold on!",""
"115740052-0-22571","What is that, up in the sky? It's like no fowl I've ever seen.",""
"115740052-0-22572","So Gilraen has brought champions to fight for her. This will not go unanswered!",""
"115740052-0-22573","Do you have a deathwish, mortal wretch? You've been complacent for so long—why seek open war now?",""
"115740052-0-22574","I'm leaving. The deal was my husband and the others would be spared. You violated the Pact, and before the day is done, I will see you dead.",""
"115740052-0-22575","A Daedra doesn't know the meaning of that word, my dear. This will be unpleasant.",""
"115740052-0-22576","For you.",""
"115740052-0-22578","That settles it! On your feet, Brittgerd. It is time to fight!",""
"115740052-0-22579","Sit down, Hogondar! You need a breather!",""
"115740052-0-22580","I have been breathing plenty! I am ready to fight!",""
"115740052-0-22581","You should wait a minute. It is not time.",""
"115740052-0-22582","What in the nine holds are you talking about? The Daedra are coming!",""
"115740052-0-22583","Bah! To Sovngarde with you!",""
"115740052-0-22584","Me? How about to Sovngarde with you!",""
"115740052-0-22585","I am very tired.",""
"115740052-0-22586","Fine. I will wait.",""
"115740052-0-22587","<A long, frustrated yell.>",""
"115740052-0-22588","Shut up!",""
"115740052-0-22589","There's no end to them!",""
"115740052-0-22590","I know! Isn't it great?",""
"115740052-0-22591","To me, champion. We must speak.",""
"115740052-0-22592","No!",""
"115740052-0-22593","Spill your guts for me, fiend!",""
"115740052-0-22594","Oh no. Where in Oblivion are we?",""
"115740052-0-22595","Ha! A literal statement!",""
"115740052-0-22596","Shut it. This is Whisper Grove. We're free.",""
"115740052-0-22598","This is it. That's the Stone we want. Destroy it, and Oblivion will let us home.",""
"115740052-0-22599","This was the worst day of my life. I'm leaving.",""
"115740052-0-22600","Enough with the Undaunted. I have been thoroughly daunted.",""
"115740052-0-22601","Well. Monynen and I will be here, having all the fun.",""
"115740052-0-22602","Who knows no fear … of beast or blade?",""
"115740052-0-22604","Who knows no fear … of Daedric planes?",""
"115740052-0-22605","Undaunted! Undaunted!",""
"115740052-0-22606","Who knows no fear … of death? Of age?",""
"115740052-0-22608","Undaunted! Undaunted! We are Undaunted!",""
"115740052-0-22609","Undaunted! Undaunted!",""
"115740052-0-22610","This is the end of the line. Valkyn Skoria wants you dead.",""
"115740052-0-22612","It has the Lord's favor. Do you see what it wears on its belt? If it truly wants to impress us, it should not cheat.",""
"115740052-0-22613","They opened the Gate? Are mortals naturally daft?",""
"115740052-0-22614","You would not say that of the one who challenges us. It learned our ways.",""
"115740052-0-22615","Ah! I have no woman and no friends, but I have the Undaunted song.",""
"115740052-0-22616","We have to keep moving. What're you looking at?",""
"115740052-0-22617","What do you think? It's been months! Are you alright?",""
"115740052-0-22618","I'm fine. I got used to it.",""
"115740052-0-22619","Got used to what? What did you do? How'd you survive?",""
"115740052-0-22620","I went native. Keep up.",""
"115740052-0-22621","I'll try.",""
"115740052-0-22622","Undaunted! Undaunted!",""
"115740052-0-22623","Undaunted! Undaunted!",""
"115740052-0-22624","Undaunted! Undaunted! We are Undaunted!",""
"115740052-0-22625","Well. I will be here, having all the fun.",""
"115740052-0-22626","I am a lonely man.",""
"115740052-0-22627","This is no place to cook, I'll be over at the Tavern.",""
"115740052-0-22628","Sobabe is done with this! Done with the Undaunted.",""
"115740052-0-22629","The things I was willing to do to get out of torture—never again.",""
"115740052-0-22630","I wasn't meant for this life.",""
"115740052-0-22631","Enough with the Undaunted. I have been thoroughly daunted …",""
"115740052-0-22632","Zantan is too old for this.",""
"115740052-0-22633","Someone come find me when you need something cut. I'll see you idiots when I see you.",""
"115740052-0-22634","I'm going to get a drink. A short vacation from getting stabbed sounds nice.",""
"115740052-0-22635","I'm not quitting, but I am going home. Knock on my door in a week.",""
"115740052-0-22636","I'll meet you over at the woodworking station.",""
"115740052-0-22637","I'll meet you over at the clothing station.",""
"115740052-0-22638","Damn it! I told him this would happen!",""
"115740052-0-22639","Fine. I'll send your head to King Emeric too!",""
"115740052-0-22640","When you're ready, find me by the cooking fire.",""
"115740052-0-22641","You can find me at the enchanting station.",""
"115740052-0-22642","When you're ready, meet me at the alchemy station.",""
"115740052-0-22643","Kill it, Uchuiran! Protect the totem!",""
"115740052-0-22644","I will crush you for that insolence.",""
"115740052-0-22645","Are you so eager to die?",""
"115740052-0-22646","You have doomed yourselves. You have no idea what you've done.",""
"115740052-0-22647","You don't know what you've done!",""
"115740052-0-22648","You will regret that.",""
"115740052-0-22649","Do you wish for death? That shield was protecting this platform!",""
"115740052-0-22650","All right. Here it is. The moment of truth! Here, boy! Come here, Rover!",""
"115740052-0-22651","Now sit! Sit, I say! Oh dear ….",""
"115740052-0-22652","Get away from me! Aaaaugh!",""
"115740052-0-22653","Stupid Elf.",""
"115740052-0-22654","You—have you been to the Temple District? Perhaps you've seen my brother?",""
"115740052-0-22655","Stay back! It's an ambush!",""
"115740052-0-22656","Frozen egg wrapped in bread. Mmmmm. Delicious. Now I can perform the ritual.",""
"115740052-0-22657","Let's see. We put the totem and the fossilized sing bone in the pot, and then we add the potion.",""
"115740052-0-22658","Stand back now. I hope this works. I hope.",""
"115740052-0-22659","There. I believe it worked. I believe the curse has been reversed.",""
"115740052-0-22661","You have a warrior's heart—unlike the others. But you won't stop my attack.",""
"115740052-0-22662","You match the ferocity of my children. Intriguing.",""
"115740052-0-22663","I will open the way!",""
"115740052-0-22664","There is a grand temple ahead.",""
"115740052-0-22665","I will unbar the path!",""
"115740052-0-22666","You can slaughter my children, but they will rise again, and strike at those who exiled me.",""
"115740052-0-22667","I can see a battle ground up ahead, through the water—multitudes of warriors. End them!",""
"115740052-0-22668","Did you hear that?",""
"115740052-0-22669","Dark-Eyes … silenced? I knew there would be sacrifices, but—perhaps I underestimated you.",""
"115740052-0-22670","I refuse to live in exile any longer. My fight is with others, but I will oblige you.",""
"115740052-0-22671","I have brought a champion to judge you, murderer.",""
"115740052-0-22672","I would tell you the same. You've slain my nest.",""
"115740052-0-22673","More surface dwellers? Your journey ends here!",""
"115740052-0-22674","Turn back or die!",""
"115740052-0-22675","This is as far as you go!",""
"115740052-0-22676","You will perish! The surface will perish!",""
"115740052-0-22677","I will enjoy digesting you!",""
"115740052-0-22678","We've conquered the Hist Tree. It's no longer a threat. We need only finish it off by setting fire to it's roots,",""
"115740052-0-22679","Your village for mine, exile. My sisters received no mercy.",""
"115740052-0-22680","I've no desire to watch. I will meet you below once you've made up your mind.",""
"115740052-0-22681","Between you and me, the best part about worshipping Trinimac is how it's improving my prospects.",""
"115740052-0-22682","Exactly. Now me and Solgra are free to be together. It's the way it should be.",""
"115740052-0-22683","I feel the same way. The tradition where only chieftains get wives is pure horker-dung.",""
"115740052-0-22684","Sorry. You can forget that. Solgra's mine. Touch her and I'll tear your throat out.",""
"115740052-0-22685","My girls say they brought down a big herd this morning. So we have enough meat for a feast?",""
"115740052-0-22686","I think we have enough. Of course, it depends on how hungry Kurog is ….",""
"115740052-0-22687","There was a problem though. One of your hunt-daughters told one of my girls she could marry whomever she wanted—that the old tradition didn't matter anymore.",""
"115740052-0-22688","Bah! When will they stop this drivel? Even if Kurog's willing to allow such a thing, you can bet your arse I'm not! And neither is Grand Forge-Mother Alga.",""
"115740052-0-22689","Captain Skorgat … they dragged him inside! You have to go after him!",""
"115740052-0-22690","That's what I said, of course. Just because we're adopting Trinimac's ideals doesn't mean we're abandoning all the old ways! Can you imagine it? Madness. Pure madness.",""
"115740052-0-22692","You don't know the trouble you're causing me by coming here.",""
"115740052-0-22693","I guess I'm a fool for trying to save your life!",""
"115740052-0-22694","I had it handled. Your Undaunted are going to die, here!",""
"115740052-0-22695","What was your plan? Come here to live like some kind of extraplanar tramp? For how long?",""
"115740052-0-22696","I gave my life so Whisper Grove could live!",""
"115740052-0-22697","Right. The village comes before family, doesn't it?",""
"115740052-0-22698","I can't believe we're having this conversation right now.",""
"115740052-0-22699","I will not abide such insolence! I will bury you here!",""
"115740052-0-22700","Your life is forfeit!",""
"115740052-0-22701","Have you forgotten where we're going?",""
"115740052-0-22702","I'm not leaving without Mogbach's heart. Come find me when you finish whatever it is you're doing.",""
"115740052-0-22703","Smells terrible in here. Like rotten chaurus eggs.",""
"115740052-0-22704","Ha! I love surprises!",""
"115740052-0-22705","Good practice. We're coming, Mogbach!",""
"115740052-0-22706","He's right. We need to deal with this.",""
"115740052-0-22707","There's one problem we won't have any more. Now where's Mogbach?",""
"115740052-0-22708","Hold up. I have something to say before we go in there.",""
"115740052-0-22709","Mogbach's still in there. We can't leave yet.",""
"115740052-0-22710","Mercy! Stay your hand!",""
"115740052-0-22711","No! There's no one left! You can't leave me alone. Who will I talk to?",""
"115740052-0-22712","I told you I'd help you.",""
"115740052-0-22713","The Gravelight Sentry is all that remains between us and the Warden.",""
"115740052-0-22714","In my experience, flesh atronachs are tools of the dim-witted. Get moving. The way out is ahead, past the last cell block.",""
"115740052-0-22715","No! I will not suffer this!",""
"115740052-0-22716","Well … if it isn't the king of pig children come to die.",""
"115740052-0-22717","I love it when my enemy helps me get into a rage.",""
"115740052-0-22718","Hm. This room is very warm.",""
"115740052-0-22719","These pipes are producing a lot of heat, but this isn't the source. Keep looking.",""
"115740052-0-22720","Don't let Chief Bazrag scare you now, Solgra. Beneath that armor, he's all soft … and I mean all soft—just ask his hunt-wife.",""
"115740052-0-22721","Oh! Well … he-he doesn't scare me, Grand Forge-Mother. I assure you of that. I just wish he didn't plague our every effort.",""
"115740052-0-22722","Hoarker's whiskers. Is this some sort of village in the canyon?",""
"115740052-0-22723","Oh look! I have a guest. I know you need to get back to the Temple. Oh my! All those candles to light. Enjoy yourself, dear.",""
"115740052-0-22724","Yes … of course. Thank you for your time, Grand Forge-Mother. I should seek your counsel more often. I'll visit again soon.",""
"115740052-0-22725","The glacier has sealed off this ruin for hundreds of years. How have these Orcs survived down here? Let's check their homes for a heat source.",""
"115740052-0-22726","They must have built these homes around these devices in order to keep warm.",""
"115740052-0-22727","Ow! This is really hot. The metal seems to be warping. Something had made these to heat up beyond what they were ment to.",""
"115740052-0-22728","Accursed Dwemer and their arcane locks!",""
"115740052-0-22729","The controls must be in there. Let's get going!",""
"115740052-0-22730","Well, there you go, you dead bastard.",""
"115740052-0-22731","Aha! He really does have an Ice Heart. The perfect trophy. Come on. Let's go.",""
"115740052-0-22732","Excellent! This should allow me to control the automated defense systems. You should go to the quarry clan's village and tell them the quarry is safe once more. I will meet you there.",""
"115740052-0-22733","What's your idea bringing these things here? Answer me, Elf!",""
"115740052-0-22734","Forgive me, Forge-Wife. I bring you an offering and an apology—these automata can be used to help work your quarry and build the great city of Orsinium.",""
"115740052-0-22735","Praise you! I was about to just dive in the water. Better to freeze than get picked apart by these things! But now I'm free! Haha!",""

"116521668-0-275","With this Chalice, and the power in the Soulstone of Brall, I believe my invocations may at last reach Ranser's spirit, wherever it may be. I must prepare myself. You should as well. When you feel ready, return to me and we shall begin.",""
"116521668-0-276","They dumped him in the sea? The dogs… it would seem we've hit a nerve at last. The Order slew Dalomar, mark my words.nnI'm sure they'll claim innocence - and the King will never question them, of course. Now you see exactly what they are.",""
"116521668-0-277","You found my Jerome? Dead? We were to be wed in six weeks time! What am I to do now? I told him not to take up with those lumberjacks, he'd have been better off on the front lines of the redoubt…",""
"116521668-0-278","Now that the common rabble know even the Numinous support the Magis Order, they'll think twice before making any more mischief. You've done good work. Before I hand over the chalice, however, I'd ask you prove yourself once more.",""
"116521668-0-279","Could you possibly have taken any longer? I was beginning to think you were in league with the filthy thieves! Never mind, you are here, so hand it over.",""
"116521668-0-280","You've acquired the Chalice of Gwedrun? Our prospects improve. I hope Danain did not treat you too harshly. He's a hard man, but the good of Camlorn drives his every action.",""
"116521668-0-281","So Jes let you ""borrow"" the Soulstone of Brall? I expect he took some convincing. I know not what to make of him - he holds the good of the people in one hand and their gold in the other. Regardless, I shall return his treasure when we're done.",""
"116521668-0-282","War? I'll show Nermarc a war! My men are beset from all sides, by packs of deathless wolves! Many are dead, and more have fallen ill! We're doing all we can, but we need help!",""
"116521668-0-283","Thank you, stranger, you're a better road warden than the entire Magis Order. Maybe now those stinking cutpurses will think twice before assaulting innocents!",""
"116521668-0-284","Our true enemy has revealed himself - some thrall of the Daedra, no doubt. I am unhurt, but his spells weakened me. Ranser's body is gone! nnWorse, the ritual has gone awry - angry spirits roam Camlorn, and I am too weak to face them alone!",""
"116521668-0-286","Finally, some true inroads against this menace! Well done indeed - thanks to your valor, we can now rally our counterstrike to eradicate these fiends once and for all. With ten more like you, Camlorn's troubles would end very quickly.",""
"116521668-0-288","I should eat you now.",""
"116521668-0-289","King Sebastien would never provoke war by slaying Ranser, but someone wished to make it appear he did. If we cannot prove Sebastien's innocence, it will mean war with Shornhelm and the Adamant Crown will break. I need your help.",""
"116521668-0-290","I fear I cannot reach Ranser's spirit. Calling into Oblivion is difficult, but of late it grows impossible. If I but knew the cause… nnYou did not come for excuses. I need two relics of great power to call out to Ranser beyond the Mundus.",""
"116521668-0-291","You seek the Chalice of Gwedrun? That beacon of darkness is a foul thing we pried from the dead hands of a daedra-worshipping witch. The world is better off without it. What use does a holy priest have for it?",""
"116521668-0-292","Canning wants the Soulstone of Brall?  You'd shudder to learn what I paid for that rare prize. War with Shornhelm would raise the price of steel, but clearing the king will keep my customers alive. So, you may borrow the stone - if you first help me.",""

"116521668-0-296","The tale you tell would shock many, but not me. I've fought the dead things that plague Camlorn, and besiege us day and night. Many of us have seen this hooded figure also - he has killed many of my men, only to vanish again.",""

"116521668-0-312","The Poisoner, they call me, as if poison is all I put my mind too. Fools. There is far more to alchemy than poison.nnYou said some noxious goblin concoction is fouling up the lake? Very well. I'll help you clean it, if only for Jacinta's sake.",""
"116521668-0-313","You are most generous to assist me, Optimate. While my priestesses could have done it themselves, I cannot bear the thought of dead hands pawing at their flesh.",""
"116521668-0-314","This sludge is complex - goblins lack the wit to mix it. Someone must have put them up to this.nnNo matter. Whatever amateur mixed this concoction was a fool. I smell black lichen, chokeweed, and… corkbulb? Ha. I already have a remedy in mind.",""
"116521668-0-315","Thank you for locating Michael. It's difficult for those who once lived here to realize how dangerous it is to enter Westtry.",""
"116521668-0-316","My last assistant was a rather clumsy oaf. Did more damage to my herbs than any goblin. Had to kill him, leaving me quite short-handed. And me with so many poisonings to do just now! nnTerribly inconsiderate of him.",""

"116521668-0-320","I knew Thetis would aid us. If he would only give up the harmful elements of his craft, we would welcome him. I would welcome him… but that is neither here nor there.nnYou and Thetis have done well, but now there is another threat at hand.",""
"116521668-0-321","With our great Wyrd Tree recovering itself, I now have the strength I lacked in Grayborne, so far from home.nnMy sisters and I owe you a debt, hero. I will do all I can to wake Varic from his healing slumber.",""
"116521668-0-322","Ah, just as I suspected. This hag did some real damage, but it hasn't been a total loss. Now that the imposter is gone, we should be able to fully regain our defenses and heal the tree from any damage that was done. Thank you for your help!",""
"116521668-0-323","The Shrouded Throne - indeed, we have heard whispers of this. The evils you've fought were orchestrated by a powerful spirit plaguing Westry - the One Who Hungers. I believe this spirit serves the Shrouded Throne, and it vexes Northmoor.",""

"116521668-0-327","I have it on good authority the Bloodstone we seek is in Aldcroft. Countess Virolynn herself may be keeping it. There is but one problem - the Magis Order holds Virolynn's docks, and they claim Virolynn's advisor, Gargast, is guilty of treason!",""
"116521668-0-328","What is this?nn… Mirielle's locket!  After all this time, the guilt of her death has sapped my youth.  But now… I am forgiven.  Even now I feel the false age leaving my bones.",""

"116521668-0-334","He was to be brought to justice - the man who took everything from me. The trial in Camlorn was to be the end of it. Yet somehow… he escaped.nnI tracked him here - the wretch. I almost had him. If I had but known of the poison on his blade…",""
"116521668-0-335","From what you said, the man you'd want is Varic Aston. Got here right after that fuss in Camlorn, to see his cousin Bruno, he said. Then, the Astons were attacked by some giant wolf! nnWyress Jacinta chased it off. Thing got Bruno, but Varic's alive.",""
"116521668-0-336","Empty.  I should have known; that bastard. nnWell, thanks for your trouble, at least.",""
"116521668-0-337","The Bell has been blessed according to the Kinlord's desires. The Isquer Kinship has a new weapon with which to fight the Maormer.",""

"116521668-0-350","I used to come here with my father between the wars. nnBack then, we always seemed to be at war. This was such a pleasant spot... before the harpies came.nnAt the very least, their colorful feathers will help me lure more fish.",""

"116521668-0-353","You found this in Westtry? I thought it lost forever. It was my grandmother's.nnWesttry was abandoned decades ago, you see. Feuding lords just about burned it down, and my grandparents... they died in that war. I never thought I'd see it again.",""
"116521668-0-354","My friend, you've returned with our tools. You've saved me... and more importantly, my profit!nnI only wish I knew why the rootlings attacked us. Did some fool at the mill cut down their trees?",""
"116521668-0-355","Your news does not surprise me. It matches well with what my own sources tell me.nnA Reachmage dabbling in necromancy could certainly account for the unique merger of undead and corrupted nature we face.nnThank you for bringing this to my attention.",""
"116521668-0-356","The goblins' hearts are filled with hate. All that remains is to return them. nnMy rootlings will gather goblins from across the land. Replacing their hearts will be easy. A cut here, a cut there. Soon, they will know the fear that fills the forest.",""
"116521668-0-357","As with all growing things, the old and rotten must be pruned away to allow the new and pure to flourish.nnWith your help, I believe our great Wyrd Tree will soon shelter the pure glen it once was.",""
"116521668-0-358","Done in no time at all, and barely a scratch on you, <<1>>.nnNow you, you I'd share a flagon with.",""
"116521668-0-359","Now the goblins understand the fear and pain they've inflicted on these noble animals.nnWe can't save all the wolves, but I hope fear of my charms will force them to free their animal slaves.nnOtherwise, those same slaves will turn against them.",""
"116521668-0-360","Touching these limbs, even a novice wyress could feel traces of Reach magic. nnThis is a perversion of nature. Their aura matches the magic emanating from the center of the Dresan ruins.nnSomething in the ruins has stirred up the spriggans.",""
"116521668-0-364","I'll keep these hawthorn seeds safe until our lands are once more free of corruption.nnSomeday, we'll be able to concentrate on the growth of the woods instead of mourning our losses.",""
"116521668-0-365","I grieve at such a necessity. The Nereids are peaceful unless one intrudes on their pools. nnWhatever black plague the Maormer unleashed has driven them mad.",""

"116521668-0-369","Ah, the Blessed Bell I requested of the priestesses of Mara. I do hope the Lady Vendialara was not too… forward with you.nnFor the expedient delivery of this weapon, you have my deepest gratitude.",""
"116521668-0-370","I'm glad to know the people of Aldcroft won't share our suffering. Before you go, I offer one last warning.nnI doubt the goblins could devise such a poison on their own. Someone's pulling their strings, and that person is our true enemy. Be wary.",""
"116521668-0-371","I've no doubt our deputy learned quite a bit from fighting alongside a hero such as yourself - they'll be a Warden in no time, mark my words. Thank you for your help.",""
"116521668-0-372","The magic you describe is a perversion of Reach magic, <<1>>. I have heard of Angof. His own people banished him for necromancy. nnAngof the Reachmage has poisoned the forest. He's corrupted our Wyrd Tree. No wonder the land lashes out in pain.",""
"116521668-0-373","If we had but ten more like you, we would retake Camlorn in short order. We - nay, all of High Rock - will make good use of your talents, mark my words.",""

"116521668-0-375","Spirits warned you of the tarn's corruption? How curious.nnMany wolves have risen as undead. Perhaps drinking the tarn's polluted water helped them spread this new plague.nnRegardless, you've saved many souls, and you've served Arkay well.",""
"116521668-0-376","Ah, these are dreadful materials indeed. These are perfect for Shava to make into Sibellec's potions. Sibellec is very good to her apprentice Shava, even if Shava must call her ""Your Majesty"" all the time.",""

"116521668-0-711","We were in pain. Your kindness saved us from a tormented existence.nnI sent my husband to Camp Tamrith. If you happen to meet him, tell him what happened here. Tell him not to return. Let Crestshade be forgotten.",""

"116521668-0-2958","I'll take your word for it. I don't think I'm cut out for this job.nnBut you weren't just rustling leaves when you spoke - unlike <<1>> here. In a better world, you'd be honored for that. Here there's just me, and a handful of coins.",""
"116521668-0-2959","It is well.nnI will prepare these eyes for the invocation. You should prepare yourself for what must be done next. I will need your aid. What is required is beyond the reach of an old woman.",""
"116521668-0-2961","I've been foolish. It's not the way of the Hist to pounce like Khajiit. They're patient. Rain and root wear the highest peak. These piles are not so high.nnI should work to end the dumping, and let the Hist remove the filth in their own time.",""
"116521668-0-2962","That is good to hear! I had feared my scout had died in the desert before finding aid.nnFor now, however, I am most concerned by the plight of Destane here.nnI fear if he is not given treatment soon he will die while we sit here fenced in by ogres!",""

"116521668-0-4642","I'd be better if the damned ruins beneath my feet weren't infested with Dominion! We've posted guards until reinforcements can wipe them clean.nnYou kept this city from tearing itself apart. Stormhold's in your debt.",""
"116521668-0-4643","Said he stirred up trouble with some mercs and had to leave town. Asked <<1>> to take over his shop, permanently.nnMentioned you, too. Said he'd pay you extra for your silence. Said you were smart enough to take a hint.",""

"116521668-0-4645","I know. I am familiar with its contents as well. The Dominion seeks to fracture us from within. That much is obvious.nnWhat is less obvious is how. I believe the answer lies here. I trust you will be able to uncover it.",""

"116521668-0-4651","Truly? The honored dead of Kragenmoor have been interred in those tombs for centuries. They were built to honor the Daedra in the time of the Chimer. nnWell done, indeed.",""

"116521668-0-4735","Just as the moon cycles through the month, true evil cannot be destroyed.nnBut there was more to this wispmother than evil. There was love. Its love was twisted, but I think it cared for him.",""
"116521668-0-4736","I don't know. I should stay here, if <<1>> will allow it. No other place will give me safe haven, and my people will want to execute me for treason.nnI can still study. Perhaps someday, I can even be forgiven.",""

"116521668-0-4943","It is well. You've proven the strength of my Great House, and you brought my son home safely.nnI now name you the Hand of Dres and offer you my aid, should you need it in the future. To their friends, the Dres are generous.",""

"116521668-0-5035","Ziddak's fatal flaw was rage, not cowardice. Now there is no male in our tribe fit to take his place.nnSome of the housemen at the temple want revenge. They will hunt our people, so Tirinaat and I are leaving.",""

"116521668-0-5045","You saw the pain that drove Vox to unleash the plague and rally the Maulborn to glorious acts of violence. Now you understand her motives and are finally ready to face her.nnWell, except for the power of Veloth's hammer. You can't overcome that.",""
"116521668-0-5046","Hey, I wouldn't want the death of the last Kothringi on my conscience. Far as I'm concerned, the keystone was lost to the swamps.",""

"116521668-0-5060","I will discover what powers the Judgment of Veloth possesses and why Vox has stolen it. In the meantime, you must pursue Magistrix Vox.nnFor your heroism and service this day, I name you a Hand of Almalexia. Go with my blessing upon you.",""

"116521668-0-5069","Our ritual was a success—a bitter one, to be sure. We died, but our Hist tree lives. As we return to the Hist, so will the tree heal. nnSomeday, there will be a new clutch hatched here. If ever you return, they will remember your courage.",""
"116521668-0-5070","I have a reward for you. It isn't much, but I stole this from their camp. It's yours.nnNow to make the rest of these invaders suffer.",""

"116521668-0-5086","It is good to know not every soul in this burned place has turned to hate. I feared my family was dead, or worse.",""

"116521668-0-5090","I am. This was our favorite place in the prison. We'd meet in secret, dreaming of escape and our life beyond these walls.nnOnce the guards found us and punished me severely, but those fleeting moments of peace were worth every lash.",""

"116521668-0-5748","Those Worms! Trying to enslave my spirit, then sacrifice me to enhance Sinmur's powers. A foolish plan, attempted by idiots. Even you were able to defeat them!nnThat shard is mine, by the way.",""
"116521668-0-5753","Good work! With that manifest, the Maormer could've intercepted our supply ships, and taken arms intended for Dominion forces.nnThey'll regret this assault. We don't take such affronts lightly.",""
"116521668-0-5754","With this group? Without a doubt! We'll make our way overland to Vulkwasten.nnWe'd have been lost without you, and the Maormer would know our secrets. This rescue brings great honor to your name, my friend. May Auri-El guide you.",""
"116521668-0-5755","Good. I lit up a few of the rowboats myself.nnA job well-done, but don't let it go to your head. It'll take the Maormer a while to recover, but they will. We must be vigilant.",""
"116521668-0-5759","I have much to consider. For now, I will rest. Perhaps one day, I will decide to exert what influence I can upon this world.nnYou have done me a great service and shall be rewarded.",""
"116521668-0-5760","Help my family any way you can.nnThey'll need it without me around.",""
"116521668-0-5764","That is probably for the best. While Pelinal's actions were brutal and often mindless, the Ayleids were not a kind people. The imprisonment was likely warranted. nnWho knows what actions the spirit may have taken once freed.",""
"116521668-0-5765","Drunk? No! Just checking the jagga. For bruising, you know? Rotmeth's the real prize, though. Thank you for finding it! I'll have some of the workers bring it home.nnI thank you. My ancestors thank you. We all thank you! Here's to your success!",""
"116521668-0-5766","A shard of Wuuthrad. Here? You must be joking. Though, from the look on your face, I see you're not. nnThe Worm Cult is a danger to us all. We'll double patrols with the five men we have. In the meantime, thank you for running them out of town.",""
"116521668-0-5778","Every tale has an end. Every end allows a beginning to set hold. It is a balance, tenuous though it seems to be.nnZ'en's presence fades from this world as Mauloch grows stronger. Perhaps these journals will give comfort to those who fear the end.",""
"116521668-0-5780","With this, the rotmeth will turn out great! A pity to lose all that ice, but to be honest … the atronach always gives me the chills. Just standing there. Watching.nnWe'll make do with the cave. What was good for our parents is good for us, eh?",""
"116521668-0-5783","Hardly a scratch! I still don't have any idea what to make of this ore, but the residual dust could be useful. nnI'll go up to the mine and talk to Jomund. I need more samples. This dust may be valuable, even if I don't fully understand it yet.",""
"116521668-0-5784","And you turned the tide and cut off the head of the worm! Without Thallik Wormfather, the cult will be severely weakened.nnThanks to you, I now see victory on the horizon.",""
"116521668-0-5785","Yes, my friend. We have. Families across the Pact-lands will rest easier tonight thanks to you.",""
"116521668-0-5786","Bah, I've no time for you, creature! Your death will be painful, lingering, and unexpected!",""
"116521668-0-5788","I think we'll be fine. Maybe we'll be a little more diligent about guard duty. We don't want to get caught unawares again! nnThanks for all your help.",""
"116521668-0-5789","Please, enjoy the hospitality of Silvenar for as long as you like … though I am certain your tale will draw you away from us soon.nnMay your story be neverending, and always of interest.",""
"116521668-0-5790","The celebrations last several days. You should stay and listen to us! We don't all know the same songs yet, but our performance will never be forgotten.nnSee you there!",""
"116521668-0-5791","I knew it wasn't my imagination! She must need something to cling to.nnI'm here, my lady. I will protect you.",""
"116521668-0-5795","If you say it's safe, I believe you. Thank you for getting me here. I never would have made it without your help.",""
"116521668-0-5797","No. With my shackles destroyed and the cult's ritual disrupted, I am free. nnThey wished to enslave me, to use me to strengthen the giant Sinmur.  I will aid you in your quest against the foul Worms.",""
"116521668-0-5806","After that story, I think I might be the one who needs a drink! Well, thanks for the information. I'll make sure to look into these accusations as soon as I can.nnBut you're not going to give up on this, are you?",""
"116521668-0-5807","Nonsense. You worry too much, my friend. This is going to be the best Corn-loon-licker ever!nnNow please take this. It's a gift for all your hard work. Rigurt insists!",""
"116521668-0-5811","I agree. These people feel wrong. Thank you for your help, sera. At least now I know what happened to my husband.",""
"116521668-0-5816","That's the deed all right. I didn't think I liked you when I met you, but you've grown on me.nnNow to deal with the hole the kwama dug. There's some kind of Dwemer ruin down there. This whole affair might turn out better than I thought it would.",""
"116521668-0-5819","Excellent work! You've done us all a favor, him especially. Thank you, stranger. May you never know hunger.",""
"116521668-0-5821","I will enter the city and find a safe place to store the Egg. Then I will enjoy the celebration.nnThe Nords know how to keep the cold at bay. It's my favorite thing about them.",""
"116521668-0-5826","And I spoke to Prince Irnskar. He agrees that he might have been a little arrogant. Especially when I told him what you discovered.nnMaybe now we can all get back to the business at hand instead of just throwing insults at each other.",""
"116521668-0-5827","Death was a just punishment for my crimes. The <<1>> released my spirit when that barrier fell.nnThe Worm Cult failed to summon Mauloch, thanks to you. And now, I am free. Safe journeys, my friend!",""
"116521668-0-5828","Khanni thanks you for saving her soul from that prison. No treasure can repay you for my freedom.",""
"116521668-0-5831","Yes, yes. I'm thankful for these wounds, in fact. They woke me up. A thane must be ever vigilant.nnThe Worms will find no shelter in the shadows of Nimalten.",""
"116521668-0-5832","You can't get the plague, so you think you can pass judgement on how we survive? Oblivion take you, outsider. You don't know what we've been through. Get out of here.",""
"116521668-0-5833","Your loss, outsider. More meat for the rest of us.",""
"116521668-0-5835","Arithiel? Then you're on our side.nnLook there! The Silvenar appeared out of nowhere, like a ghost! You'd better speak with him. I dare not draw the Orcs' attention to him.",""
"116521668-0-5839","A Tharn? That's at once curious, fortuitous, and suspicious.nnI'm feeling more lucid now. I will speak with this Tharn. We shall see if his plan is sound.",""
"116521668-0-5843","I'd slit his throat right now if I could, but there's no time … not with the dead on our doorstep.nnDeal with the dead. Stop the attack. After that, we'll expose Thorulf for what he is!",""
"116521668-0-5846","Unusual, but not unworkable.nnShandi will make this less edible and more readable. Thank you for your gift!",""
"116521668-0-5851","I'll spend the rest of my life atoning for my crimes. Starting with telling my traveling companions the truth about my past. If I'm shunned for my actions, so be it.nnThank you for giving me a chance to start over.",""
"116521668-0-5852","Naturally. My plans always work. And while you were sowing dissent, I paid a visit to the Redguards' last ship. Their journey home will be … comfortable.nnYou've done a service for the Dominion. Take this, with my compliments.",""
"116521668-0-5856","I don't care if the Eight themselves sent you. If you're here to help, you have my thanks.",""
"116521668-0-5857","Did he mention the finder's fee he receives for sending you into the swamp? Of course not.nnSince he didn't, I'll provide you with his fee directly. Hand it to him the next time you see him, or use it for a pair of watertight boots.",""
"116521668-0-5859","Because of you, I've finally joined my sisters. I feel like we're old friends already.nnPerhaps the four of us can heal the spriggans and drive the Worm Cult away for good. It'd be like being the Green Lady once again!",""
"116521668-0-5865","Then we are allies. For now.nnI must go to my father. I don't care how we do it, but his life must be saved. My father can't die. Fildgor will not win this war! Not this way! I forbid it!",""
"116521668-0-5872","You … you're a hero to honest businessmen everywhere. I'll teach my children songs about you! Look at Turil glowering. I hope he gets a disease and drowns in his own fluids.",""
"116521668-0-5873","Did … did you notice that? Just now, as you handed me the silk. The sun shone through the clouds. Thank you. And look at Enthis over there. May he suffocate beneath a pile of mammoth dung.",""
"116521668-0-5879","This one must deliver the news, first to <<1>>, then to the province generals. Once a consensus is reached, <<2>> will be arrested and tried.nnThis one advises you to stay close. You'll be needed as a key witness when the time comes.",""
"116521668-0-5880","Recording your deeds here will be my first act as Sage of Fallowstone Hall. The Companions will recover from this setback. Vigrod and I will make sure of it.",""
"116521668-0-5883","Very well. Thank you for bringing these to me. I'll begin my research straight away. nnI'm certain it's only a matter of time before we'll need your assistance again. Be sure to check in every now and then!",""
"116521668-0-5885","Right. He's mine to deal with, and I will. As for you, you saved my hall. I owe you.nnI want you to keep Bonebane, use it as I did. My adventuring days are over. As for this cursed shard, Hallfrida will keep it safe until you need it again.",""
"116521668-0-5886","I'll keep it safe until you need it. You have my word as Thane of Fullhelm.nnIf not for you, we'd all be dead. It's a debt I can't repay, but you can start by keeping Bonebane. Use it like my grandfather did. Make these Worm Cult bastards bleed.",""
"116521668-0-5887","I'll keep this shard safe until you need it. You have my vow. If not for you, the garrison would be dead, and I - I'd be in the hands of that disgusting man. I'm the Thane, and a daughter of Skyrim. I'll do my duty. This pass will be defended.",""
"116521668-0-5889","I never had a chance. They drugged us. Then the Hagraven came. Its breath on my face! It sucked out my eyes. I'll never see again.",""
"116521668-0-5891","I'll never regain my eyesight, but I'll live. Porath will see me back to Shor's Stone. Come see me, if you ever return.",""
"116521668-0-5896","Then by all means, let me have it.nnExcellent! The fort is back under our control, thanks to you. You've made quite a name for yourself amongst our soldiers, friend. Lieutenant Koruni, in particular, seems suitably impressed with your efforts.",""
"116521668-0-5899","There's a necromancer here, but I can't find him. He must be in the catacombs beneath the shrine. That's the only place that makes sense.",""
"116521668-0-5900","Perhaps if my brother is still alive. I just hope it's not too late.",""
"116521668-0-5901","That's refreshing. Most days, it's just Rana and me against the world. nnWe have some work to do.",""

"116521668-0-5932","And not a moment too soon. nnWe can't wait for more reinforcements. We must strike back against these bastards before we lose our chance.",""

"116521668-0-5934","Great work! I knew we could depend on you.",""
"116521668-0-5935","Yes. As Ysgramor said, their masters reside in Coldharbour. We have no choice but to invade.n nI must return to Mournhould, my friend. I hope to see you there.",""
"116521668-0-5936","I'll make sure the families of the fallen get these. It should give them some closure at least.",""

"116521668-0-5938","<<1>> and <<2>> both did. Each deserved what they received. The guild will be staggered by this. I have no choice but to take command as the Master General and hold the guild together. Thank you for standing with me during these dark times, friend.",""
"116521668-0-5943","<The totem matches the gruesome style of the Green Hunters under Ulthorn's control. They must already be within Treehenge.>",""

"116521668-0-5957","Maybe I will … but don't be too insistent about that.nnKeep your curiosity to yourself. Better to stay silent and be thought a fool than to speak carelessly and have your throat cut.",""
"116521668-0-5959","Shor's Bones! I'm glad to hear that. On both counts! I wasn't looking forward to going up there. The mountain has a terrible reputation. I'll take the shard back to Riften and keep it safe until you need it.",""

"116521668-0-5983","They are safe. Trolls still roam the area, but they will get bored and wander off when the food runs out. Hopefully, they won't look in this cave.nnWe are in your debt. My skills are yours, should you ever need them.",""

"116521668-0-6116","Excellent! It'll take time to break their code, but that's time well-spent.nnI'll try not to bloody these up any more than you already have. Are you sure you didn't use them as bandages? Ah, well. Never mind. I'll take care of them.",""
"116521668-0-6121","Then I am ready to conclude the ceremony in the Ancestral Chamber. Thank you. With your help, we were able to salvage my reputation … and this holy and most sacred place, as well.",""

"116521668-0-6147","I don't know what we'd have done, living out the rest of our lives as cheese-eating rodents. Yech!nnIf I ever find that mage, I'm going to show him what it means to be vermin!",""

"116521668-0-6168","You can hold your drink, and you sing like a bird. Geirmund would be proud!",""
"116521668-0-6169","The shard enabled Gullveig to devour souls and ascend into lich form. I'll keep the shard safe from now on.nnYou saved our lives and prevented evil from spreading out of Lost Prospect. I hope to return the favor someday.",""

"116521668-0-6512","We'll just have to see, won't we?nnIn any case. For the lads and lasses here—thank you.",""
"116521668-0-6514","Sadly, yes. The attack is underway.",""
"116521668-0-6520","I don't expect you to understand, landlubber. But I'm the captain, and I always will be.",""
"116521668-0-6523","These weapons are works of art. I know this will help. nnIf we can end the curse of the Everfull Flagon, I will die a happy man.",""
"116521668-0-6524","I'll make my way to the Hollow City with any who wish to join me. Some may wish to stay here, where it's familiar.  nnI just wish my father were here. I am comforted knowing that perhaps we will meet again in Sovngarde.",""
"116521668-0-6525","Desperation drives men into bad bargains. The Daedric Princes wait for such opportunities.nnI promise you, I will try and help these people. We will make our way to the Hollow City when we have recovered a bit.",""
"116521668-0-6526","That's right. I'll collect Nelulin on the way out. I think maybe we'll retire to the countryside. nnThat sounds nice. Goodbye.",""
"116521668-0-6527","You did what you could. I somehow knew it would end this way.nnThank you for listening to a mother's plea. I'd like to be alone now.",""
"116521668-0-6528","I don't know. I'll go wherever I'm supposed to go, I guess. Wherever it is, it has to be better than here.nnThank you. Now, if you'll excuse me.",""
"116521668-0-6535","So you have chosen. So shall it be.nnYour allegiance has been pledged to Thallik Wormtongue.",""

"116521668-0-6543","Stand back while I put on the crown. If I turn on you, strike me down.",""
"116521668-0-6557","I have heard rumors of such a place. Just remember our agreement. Help me find a way to become what I once was and I will aid you against Molag Bal.nnI will find you in this city of yours soon enough.",""
"116521668-0-6567","Estre. If only you arrived here sooner. It's a lesson I'll never forget. She decimated my town!nnIf you can help, please, speak to Landare.",""
"116521668-0-6568","Yes, yes. We are here to gather some intelligence, right some wrongs. nnAnd perhaps slit some throats. We'll see how the day goes.",""
"116521668-0-6572","Yes, I know you must have been concerned about the messenger. He made it through safely.",""
"116521668-0-6573","We'll head out at once. That was where we were trying to go when we got separated from the others.nnI wish Angof the best. He really wasn't that bad. I think somewhere, deep inside, he remembered what it was like to be human.",""
"116521668-0-6574","Yes, I know of it. My former master spoke of it once. How he hated the place!nnI'll make my way there. Come and get me when you're ready to actually do something significant.",""
"116521668-0-6575","This one will find it. That was where we were headed when we got separated from the others.nnAt least I am no longer under the thumb of that horrible, horrible Breton!",""
"116521668-0-6576","I'll find this city of yours. I could do with a bath and a glass of fine wine. It's been far too long.nnJust remember our agreement. You help me, and I help you.",""
"116521668-0-6577","That's the place we were trying to reach when the portal spit us in all directions.nnYou really are remarkable. I can't believe you actually won that twisted game. We'll see you in the city. Find us when you have need of our skills.",""
"116521668-0-6580","You gave him … damn! He ran off to drink it all himself, didn't he?nnI have to get back to town. Take this, and thank you, friend!",""
"116521668-0-6581","You've done more than many would do—more than many would be capable of. I think my friends and I will need to recuperate before setting out to sea again.",""
"116521668-0-6587","Thank you, outsider. Because of you, the Hist tree's eternal suffering and enslavement shall finally come to an end.nnWe shall mourn the Hist, but we shall also find solace now that its pain and torment is over. When you need us, we shall be there.",""
"116521668-0-6588","You made the right choice, outsider. Life must always be preserved and cherished, even a life of pain and suffering and bondage.nnWhen the time comes, my warriors will be yours to command. Perhaps if you succeed, the Hist can finally be free.",""
"116521668-0-6589","I hope you are.",""
"116521668-0-6594","Good. You have passed the Trial of the Body.",""
"116521668-0-6602","Good work. With this I can convince my superiors of the Imperial threat.  The Dominion needs more soldiers like you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an ambush to plan.",""
"116521668-0-6603","Give you my gratitude.nnThe Daedra drove Nerien'eth to do this. I know it. I would leave this plane, but I cannot, knowing Nerien'eth is still out there. He may return, and on that day, I will do everything I can to free him from Daedric influence.",""
"116521668-0-6604","That Sea Drake attack was the last straw. Iriana and I are going back to town and not leaving until we find a ship off this damned island.",""
"116521668-0-6605","I'm amazed it worked at all, but thanks to you, I've made remarkable strides today. Neramo will be thrilled!nnPlease take this for your good work.",""
"116521668-0-6606","Yeah, well, I guess I did prove something, I'm not cut out for this. I'm heading back to make cheese, guess I'll never see my family again, but better that than be branded a coward. Thanks anyway.",""
"116521668-0-6607","I love the sound of bullies blubbering! Well, you've convinced me. If you can find my sister Iriana and convince her to join you, then we'll see you on-board.",""
"116521668-0-6610","Oh, very well!nnA good captain recognizes the signs of mutiny, and this whole place is a pot about to boil over. We can take advantage of that.",""
"116521668-0-6627","And not a moment too soon.nnI managed to subdue one of the tomes. It's proven most enlightening.",""
"116521668-0-6629","I've already lost everything. The Pact killed my father for dissenting, and my mother died of grief. What you see here is all I have left in this world.nnBut I certainly don't need your pity. Leave me.",""
"116521668-0-6630","I must get as far away from here as possible before <<1>> captures me again. nnPerhaps I'll stow away on a merchant's ship. I doubt anyone else would show me such kindness. Goodbye. And thank you.",""
"116521668-0-6631","I'm fortunate you were the one to find her. She may not know it yet, but <<1>>'s lucky to be alive.nnI'll gather what little belongings we have and head to Mournhold. I hope we meet again, friend.",""
"116521668-0-6632","This is the end dialogue for the condition testing quest.",""
"116521668-0-6635","No details, please!nnWith <<1>> and my ruby back, I just may survive this trip. I kept a few coins for expenses. Here, take them with my thanks.",""
"116521668-0-6637","I have heard rumors of such a place. We shall go there at once. And have no fear. I will make sure that your friends arrive safely.nnPerhaps the city will provide me more clues as to the magic I seek.",""
"116521668-0-6641","Yes, I know of the place. My former master spoke of it once. Its presence annoyed him so.nnI'll go with the mages. Perhaps I'll even help them if they run into trouble. You never know. Find me when you're ready to do something significant.",""
"116521668-0-6643","Excellent! He'll be perfectly safe. Well, assuming he avoids its gaping maw and other pointy bits, that is.",""
"116521668-0-6644","Ah, I wondered about that. It seems the device will require more testing before it's perfected.nnHowever, you've helped my research immensely. For that, I express thanks.",""
"116521668-0-6646","Yes, yes. That's all of them. Now, let's see. If I toss Tanamo into a cabin and set sail today I should just make Velyn ahead of the news.nnGood luck, drylegs.",""
"116521668-0-6647","Yes, yes. That's all of them. Now, let's see. If I toss Tanamo into a cabin and set sail today, I should just make Velyn ahead of the news.nnGood luck, drylegs.",""
"116521668-0-6649","A city? Ah, what an excellent idea. A warm bath, a glass of fine wine. I don't remember the last time I had such luxuries.nnThese dear mages and I will keep each other company along the way. We should have no problems reaching the place!",""
"116521668-0-6654","You could've just taken care of your own business in there and left us to our fate. But you didn't. nnI owe you. If that strange city over there has a tavern, the first drink's on me. And … thanks.",""
"116521668-0-6657","This means three things. First, you were instrumental in crushing the pirate invasion of <<1>>. Second, the Dominion's leadership owes you a debt of thanks.nnAnd third, I am privileged to be the one who pays it. An honor to fight beside you.",""
"116521668-0-6659","Then I'll distill an antidote immediately. With so many poisoned, we couldn't have repelled the bandits without your help.",""
"116521668-0-6660","What has the fool girl done?nnNever mind that. <<1>> has almost finished his antidote. Once <<2>> recovers, our warriors will find these bandits and crack open their skulls.",""
"116521668-0-6661","I see.nnI take no pleasure in my brother's death. I know he blamed me for his loss, but to come after his bloodkin in this way? It was what must be done.",""
"116521668-0-6670","That's as good a plan as any. Here's the other Daedric key, as promised. Sorry for holding out on you. nnI owe you a drink. Here's hoping there's a tavern in your Hollow City.",""
"116521668-0-6671","I'll make sure the Fighters Guild regroups and recuperates in this city of yours.nnI wish I'd retired before signing up for this campaign.",""
"116521668-0-6684","You will? We have waited such a long time for someone to aid us in our struggle. You have made me very happy, outsider! nnNow we can get our children back! Now we can have our revenge!",""
"116521668-0-6685","I knew you would help me! I'll show you how to get into the tower, but first you need to convince my people to end their service to Molag Bal.nnAnd to do that, you have to prove yourself to my clan.",""
"116521668-0-6686","They're putting out the lighthouse signal fire so ships will crash on the rocks! nnSomeone's got to warn the lighthouse keeper—Tyree. Damn it! If only we could spare the men!nnThanks for at least letting me know. Safe travels, friend.",""
"116521668-0-6687","He wouldn't share.",""
"116521668-0-6688","He wouldn't share.",""
"116521668-0-6689","He wouldn't share.",""
"116521668-0-6690","They were marched off to the east. My first mate went after them, but I can't imagine she'll be able to free them alone.nnIf you travel in that direction, keep an eye out for her. If she doesn't return soon, I may just have to track her down myself.",""
"116521668-0-6693","What has the fool girl done?nnNever mind that. <<1>> has almost finished his antidote. Once <<2>> recovers, our warriors will find these bandits and crack open their skulls.",""
"116521668-0-6694","Truly? This is wonderful!nnPlease, accept a meager payment for your trouble. And if a strangler-infested marsh doesn't frighten you, perhaps we should speak of additional work.",""
"116521668-0-6700","Oh, excellent! Let me see. Oh my, look at this gibberish. Driven insane by ancient ruins? This is a gold mine! The pseudo-intellectuals of Elden Root love this stuff.nnThe commentary volumes alone will keep me employed for years to come.",""
"116521668-0-6705","Well, you're full of surprises! You weren't followed here, were you?nnNo, no, never mind, I'm sure everything's fine. Thank you for delivering this! Good for the crew's morale.",""
"116521668-0-6708","We are the jungle. We were trapped in the city of stone by the Elf-things, unable to drink from the sun. But you have freed us. Even now the green calls us back to the fold. We will … do what we can to atone.nnWe thank you.",""
"116521668-0-6712","An unfortunate end to the young fool … Well, I suppose it's time to evict my brother and his hag from my rightful home.nnYou are welcome to visit the stronghold anytime, my friend. You have brought justice to my people. For that I am grateful.",""
"116521668-0-6713","She wouldn't say that lightly. With quality metal, I could rebuild this tower as a new home and drive my brother's tin profits into the ground.nnI'm an Orc of my word. My quarrel ends today.",""
"116521668-0-6715","Once you complete this quest, check off the ""complete a quest"" case.  Then check your Quest Journal to make sure it's not still tracking, and you're done!",""
"116521668-0-6724","Auri-el bless and keep you, traveler. You have no idea how much this means to an old woman. Now I can find peace myself. nnI'll be with my babies soon. It's been so long since I've seen their faces.",""
"116521668-0-6731","I'm sorry to hear that. But at least you found the parts.nnI'll fix Leggy up good as the day he was forged. From where my heartwater wells up, I thank you.",""
"116521668-0-6735","Oh, you did. And, as promised, here's your share of the winnings. Finally things are looking up for Firtoril!",""
"116521668-0-6742","The Heritance has expanded beyond Auridon? Damnit. nnI'll make sure the boss hears about your good work. Thanks for your service.",""
"116521668-0-6745","I know your story well. Your coming was foretold.nnYou rescued some of the scattered members of our procession of bones. For this, you have my thanks.",""
"116521668-0-6746","The bones are safe for now, but it is only a matter of time before the Cult find a way inside.",""
"116521668-0-6747","Ill tidings, but with <<1>> defeated, and Dringoth destroyed, the Jaqspurs should have no trouble keeping the undead at bay. The Blessing will be restored with the help of the elders.nnYou have my sincere thanks. May Y'ffre bless your journey.",""
"116521668-0-6748","Those disgusting rot worshippers … At least I can now put my kin to rest.nnOn behalf of my family, you have heartfelt thanks.",""
"116521668-0-6753","You can hold your drink, and sing like a bird. Geirmund would be proud.",""
"116521668-0-6772","Good. Seeing Imperials floating downstream brightens my day. The reward is yours.",""
"116521668-0-6779","Yes, that confirms what I've been told. The involvement of the Midnight Union is troubling — this violence at the abbey is far beyond mere smuggling and gambling. nnYou have our gratitude.",""
"116521668-0-6787","I suppose I'll write a paper about it. This hunk of crystal will occupy the next five years of my life.nnIt's a bit sad when I say it out loud.",""
"116521668-0-6789","Oh, no. I hoped we would join together in one last embrace, before triggering our death with my voice. But I whispered his name aloud as I waited … was that enough to collapse the stones?nnI should … go now ….",""
"116521668-0-6795","I'm amazed the Imperials hadn't stolen it already. I suspect they left it in the hopes of trapping me if I came to get it. You foiled that plan. Well done.",""
"116521668-0-6796","Excellent! These should help fund us for a few more days, at least. Here's your share.",""
"116521668-0-6802","Ha! I look forward to the sounds of puking coming from across the river. Should make things safer around here for a day or two. Great job!",""
"116521668-0-6805","I thank the Eight for you, <<1>>! As soon as I recover, I'll return to Wayrest and recommend a full squad be sent to clear out this wretched place.nnTake this coin for your trouble. Safe journeys to you.",""
"116521668-0-6813","Good. I hope we can take advantage of the confusion you've caused. But we must act soon, as they will quickly promote a new lieutenant from the ranks.",""
"116521668-0-6817","I'll keep you in mind if anyone else gets captured. The soldiers insisted I give you this reward.",""
"116521668-0-6822","Of course. He couldn't risk being captured.nnYou lived to tell the tale. I hear gold heals all wounds.",""
"116521668-0-6835","They'll build more, but you've slowed them down. The Shadowed Path will be a problem as long as this civil war lasts. After that, they're my next target.nnYou've earned this reward.",""
"116521668-0-6837","I hear Kaleen intends to head toward the isle of Betnikh. The ruins there greatly interest me. But first, I will assist you in this heist.",""
"116521668-0-6838","I had it in my hands … and it vanished in that blinding light! Blasted Dwemer magic.nnThen those undead came, crawling from the ground. Perhaps the Eye woke them. Sep's tongue, something awful has befallen this place. We need to get clear.",""
"116521668-0-6839","It's beautiful! It'll definitely go on my mantle at home, if I ever get my house back from the Imperials.",""
"116521668-0-6842","I will tell the troops; morale will improve greatly. Sometimes I feel more like a nursemaid than a troop commander.nnThank you.",""
"116521668-0-6846","Excellent … ""The Circus of Cheerful Slaughter?"" That's quite a title!nnI'll begin my research immediately. Can't wait to get to it.",""
"116521668-0-6852","Saving our lives is a little more than just ""help."" Next time you see us, we'll be privateers!nn<<1>> and I are going to miss you. We scrounged a bit and came up with something. I hope it serves you well.",""
"116521668-0-6855","You said it. I'm not fighting anymore. I'll make weapons for others. Mother will just have to get used to it. Thanks for everything!",""
"116521668-0-6856","Well, thanks for that. Who am I kidding? I am not cut out for this work. I'll return the sword back to my mother, after I make some cheese back at town. If I can make something good, maybe they'll let me stay. At least I can return the sword, right?",""
"116521668-0-6857","I'm going to give this warrior stuff a try! Maybe I'll see you again, if I survive.",""
"116521668-0-6858","The Stonefire cult is secretly manipulating the Colovians, who have no more love of Daedra worship than we do. With this knowledge our strategy should be to expose the manipulation.",""
"116521668-0-6859","It's as I said. This is the realm of Baan Dar himself! To many he is the Pariah, an outcast. But we Bosmeri and the Khajiit know him for what he is. The Legend, the Robber Baron, Master of Shadows—he who is called the Bandit God! Baan Dar!",""
"116521668-0-6861","""Driven off?"" You mean she's not dead? I hope you know what you're doing.nnWe'll oversee the Goblins from here. Their continued cooperation will ensure that they are spared.",""
"116521668-0-6862","""Driven off?"" She's not dead?nnFar be it from me to question you, but I really hope that doesn't come back to bite us later. Still, the alliance is broken. We'll take it from here.",""
"116521668-0-6863","Excellent. I'll take it to <<1>>. Meet us in her office when you are done with everything you else.",""
"116521668-0-6865","Great. I will take these to the commander right away. Join us when you are ready.",""
"116521668-0-6869","You've done those refugees a great favor. They've endured enough. I'll stay here to watch for others who might need aid. nnAs for you, please accept this, along with the gratitude of a knight.",""
"116521668-0-6877","I'm sorry. I got back here and I had to tell my parents and my friends about the slaver attack down at the village ….nnAnd then it just completely slipped my mind. Not much point in doing it now.",""
"116521668-0-6888","I don't know. With the ritual ended, the undead in this facility should slowly fade with time. As for myself, well … I suppose I could approach the Mages Guild, see if my services could be of use.nnI'm sure I'll figure something out.",""
"116521668-0-6890","No trouble from giants, eh? Well, you have my thanks and that of the good patrons here. They'll eat and drink well tonight because of you.",""
"116521668-0-6891","You've earned this coin then. If all sellswords were more like you, they'd find a warmer welcome!",""
"116521668-0-6892","I suppose I always knew he wasn't coming back. But this letter …. He left us to keep us safe. ""I will sing of you in the halls of Sovngarde."" Oh, father ….nnThank you. I have peace at last.",""
"116521668-0-6893","I disapprove. Many of my people had their souls consumed by that thing. You have condemned others to the same fate.nnEven so, you saved my tribe. For that, I will respect your decision. Without you, we would all be dead.",""
"116521668-0-6895","The only correct choice. War should be honorable. There is no honor in the use of such a device.nnYou have saved my tribe and my island. For this, I owe you a great debt.",""
"116521668-0-6897","And I've got your payment! Jilan-dar always keeps some squirreled away in the bottom of the boat. The goblins overlooked it, thankfully.nnPleasure doing business with you, and thanks for saving Khajiit.",""
"116521668-0-6900","If you're talking to me, you probably did! Great job. Go team!",""
"116521668-0-6923","Isn't it obvious? Open the door! They must be hiding something good down there.nnLet's go see!",""
"116521668-0-6924","I have to face the Hound. If I can reason with him, then there'll be no need to go after the Silvenar.nnEven after all he's done, I need to give him that chance.",""
"116521668-0-6940","Seeing as it's you asking, sure. If she's planning a job, I'm in. All I ask is a trip off this rock after it's over.",""
"116521668-0-6941","Yes. Yes, I do. I know someone on the island who can make us both rich.nnIf you're up for another job, I think it's time you met her.",""
"116521668-0-6942","I hope she listens to reason. She acts like she's in charge, but she wouldn't even listen to my proposal. Trade proposal, mind you. Not a marriage proposal!nnThose snake hides would earn them plenty of gold. Plenty of gold for all of us!",""
"116521668-0-6944","The Green Lady is my betrothed. Well met! If you are her friend, you can help me.nnYou see, I'm trapped in <<1>>, and need assistance to free myself and those captured with me.",""
"116521668-0-6946","Listen, I thought I contracted corpus from the Skeever cookies she gave me last year! She'll be fine! Thanks again, that was a great trick. I'm sure Baan Dar is well pleased.",""
"116521668-0-6950","Excellent work, I knew I could count on you.nnWith the reinforcements here, we can see to the Goblins as peacefully as we can. There will be restrictions, of course, but their willingness to stay out of the fighting may well save them.",""
"116521668-0-6951","Not a tough choice, I imagine. Even those rare goblins capable of speaking are little more than animals.nnWe'll take it from here. The Toothmaul won't be helping the Veiled Heritance any time soon.",""
"116521668-0-6953","Good news. Good news indeed. I was feeling a bit parched on this beach. Ale's run dry, you see.nnI've a slew of hard-working lads I mentored back in Anvil, and many the contact who might … help <<1>>. My thanks for your service.",""
"116521668-0-6956","That ring belonged to Raerana's mother! It's got her name inscribed on it. Damned bandits willing to murder for gold. Bastards. Poor Raerana!nnWell, I appreciate you getting to the bottom of this.",""
"116521668-0-6959","Though Dro-Dara is sad to see Murk-Watcher leave us, he is happy to know this evil man is dead.nnPerhaps someday this plantation may flourish again. Not by Dro-Dara's hand though. Knarstygg and I are leaving. Goodbye, and thank you.",""

"116521668-0-7281","I'll get it as far away from Marius as possible. You've saved numerous lives today.",""
"116521668-0-7282","I know it's a lot to take in. We'll talk more later.nnIn the meantime, I'll keep an eye on the Prophet. Hopefully that orb will help him find out where Sai Sahan is being held. Once we know that, we can plan our next move.",""
"116521668-0-7283","This is the last of it, then. Anyone who tries to stand in my way will regret it.nnHere's your coin, as promised. Now begone, there's much work to be done.",""
"116521668-0-7285","Is there? You don't just recover from vampirism. nnGods, what am I talking about? He's my son! I have to try. nnI'm not ready to lose him.",""
"116521668-0-7286","You have my never-ending thanks! If I should meet a singer in my travels, I'll commission a song in your honor.nnLuck to your house, my friend.",""
"116521668-0-7287","Help? You saved me from a fate worse than death! What that Argonian had planned … well, you'll see! The claw's on the other foot, now.nnPlease, take this reward. It's not much, but you've earned it tenfold.",""
"116521668-0-7288","My gratitudinous knows no bounds. I'm not certain my reputation would survive the humiliation of paying off this bet.nnHere, take this. It may not help a hunter of your obvious adroitinosity, but you deserve something for your efforts.",""
"116521668-0-7289","You're right. It has to be done. It has to.",""
"116521668-0-7290","Dead? Then the guides told the truth. Thank you for my strength and my life!nnI'll visit Mauloch's fury upon our clan! They'll pay the blood price for abandoning my father and me.",""
"116521668-0-7291","Dead? I don't … the males of my clan were right. I'm weak, not worth saving. Still, the poison no longer burns in my veins.nnThank you for your efforts. I'll stay here and rest. Perhaps some day I'll be strong enough to leave.",""
"116521668-0-7306","That is some consolation at least. Mallius will be sorely missed. Thank you, friend, for bringing the urn and news of Mallius's end.nnIn the future, if you know you will face Daedra, return to me. I may be able to help.",""
"116521668-0-7307","His last blessing, given to another. I am not surprised—Mallius was ever selfless. I will travel to <<1>> and recover his body. He deserves rest.nnThank you, friend, for all you have done. Arkay be with you!",""
"116521668-0-7310","What you've done has helped the entire town. You've given us back our pride.nnWe should never have let those Red Rooks frighten us. We're tougher than that. You can bet we'll be better prepared in the future.",""
"116521668-0-7315","Aren't we all, my friend. Aren't we all.nnWe might be able to assist each other, but we have some other business to take care of first.",""
"116521668-0-7320","Yes. I'll say my farewells first. It won't be easy, but I won't sneak out like a thief. My family has a right to hear it from my lips. nnI'll see you on the ship when you're ready to leave.",""
"116521668-0-7321","Travel to <<1>> to have it appraised. Surely Zahra has dealt with <<2>> in the past. She is wily, but Zahra is her match.nnHere is compensation for your efforts. Rest assured, you will be remembered when Zahra tells the tale!",""
"116521668-0-7323","That and more! Well worth your reward! I have thrown in a little extra, I hope it is satisfactory?nnNow to find a buyer! <<1>> is a good place to start, I think. Old <<2>> owes <<3>> a favor!",""
"116521668-0-7326","I thank you. Water and bandages will keep our wounded from passing over Shor's Bridge.nnTake this for your efforts.",""
"116521668-0-7331","I can open a portal that will return you to Tamriel. However, we will arrive at the same place.nnLyris and I must plan our next move. For now, escape through the portal behind you. When I am safe, I will contact you again.",""
"116521668-0-7338","Kyne be praised! We'll get these prepared immediately. nnYour efforts will save lives here. I can't thank you enough.",""
"116521668-0-7341","You've done more than most. Thank Kyne you showed up to help us!",""
"116521668-0-7343","Good news. Good news indeed. I was feeling a bit parched on this beach. Ale's run dry, you see.nnI know several hard-working lads back in Anvil. I'll see they throw a proper … hero's welcome for <<1>>. My thanks for your service.",""
"116521668-0-7344","What? That can't be. Being a bandit was supposed to be full of excitement and adventure. If you have this then he must have really said that. I need some time alone to think.",""
"116521668-0-7345","The Seamount Warchief? Impressive. I don't know what you did to convince him, friend, but you have my gratitude. Well done!nnI will take this petition to High King Emeric immediately. Enjoy your stay in Daggerfall.",""
"116521668-0-7347","Thank you. I'm still not ready to marry, but I accept my duty to my clan. I'll ask my father's wives for guidance, to prepare for my duties.",""
"116521668-0-7348","Yes. The Golden Claw is one of the artifacts that a Moon Hallowed may obtain to prove their worth. nnI never thought I'd touch this artifact in all my life. It's an honor. I will keep it safe until the time comes for it to perform its role.",""
"116521668-0-7349","Thank you. I can't leave to do this myself, and few others would survive the trip. Your efforts will keep at least some here from passing over Shor's Bridge.",""
"116521668-0-7351","That gives us some breathing room. I'm sure they'll try again, but we'll burn that bridge when we come to it.nnAluri will keep an eye on the roads. That's all we can do for now.",""
"116521668-0-7365","No. That's for someone more capable than a simple road worker like me. nnYou did well tracking the Rieklings from Cragwallow to here. The bard wasn't hurt too badly, but I saw what they did to the others. It was awful!",""
"116521668-0-7368","We'll stay here for a while, at least until the trolls are gone.nnMany thanks for your help. If you ever have the need for a Dreamwalker, you only need to ask. It would be my honor to help one who helped us.",""
"116521668-0-7369","I may not be the most honest Nord, but I promised I would surrender myself to the royal workers if you got me away from the rieklings. And I will.nnI never intended for anyone to get hurt. I'll stay away from enchanted items from now on.",""
"116521668-0-7370","A sorry tale. The lying bard got many of my friends killed.nnI'll tell the others what happened. A rough end, but fitting for one such as him.",""
"116521668-0-7376","Then it's as the Mane suggested. Magical forces are at work here that we can't fight with sheer numbers. I shouldn't be surprised.nnI'm just glad we have you and Indaenir on hand to sort this out. Yes. I think maybe Y'ffre smiles on us after all.",""
"116521668-0-7380","So now you know. Our foes are deadly and numerous. It is wisdom, not cowardice, that keeps us inside the shelters left to us.",""
"116521668-0-7381","By the Green, well done. I was beginning to wonder if anyone was going to show up. Claim these pretty little coins … ah, and these will do fine. I get a pretty necklace and there are fewer dangerous beasts wandering the wilds. Here you go!",""
"116521668-0-7382","Ha! And you're worried I won't hold up my end of the bargain? nnNo no. I keep my promises. You got rid of those parasitic Orcs—you've earned the right to petition the Wilderking for an audience.",""
"116521668-0-7383","Damn. This proves that Pelidil is planning something here, something even bigger than killing the queen.nnI'm glad you brought it to light. I just hope it's not too late for us to do something about it.",""
"116521668-0-7384","You have not yet earned that knowledge, which Naemon and Pelidil took by force.nnThey went to Hectahame. Where you go is your choice, but I will be watching.",""
"116521668-0-7387","I'll let them know. We must get help, so we can only send out the runners and hope some survive.nnThe way our luck is going, the Dremora will get them all before they leave town.",""
"116521668-0-7388","Well done! Now we can face the giants as equals!",""
"116521668-0-7389","Well done! Now we can face the giants as equals!",""
"116521668-0-7395","I truly cannot thank you enough. This one wishes she could stay and chat, but she must deliver the coffer as soon as possible. Safe travels!",""
"116521668-0-7396","Thank you once again. You're truly a boon to both the alliance and my people.nnI never thought I'd touch this artifact in all my life. It's an honor. I will keep it safe until the time comes for it to perform its role.",""
"116521668-0-7398","Moons be damned, I will get my sister back. I don't care what that moldering old ghost says. I'll walk the Path with you, cut Tharn's throat, and come back with an army of mages to free Shazah from this torment.",""
"116521668-0-7400","That's a small blessing. If I had known what Skorvild was doing, maybe I could have talked to him and stopped this.nnAnyway, thanks for your help. You kept a bad situation from turning even worse.",""
"116521668-0-7401","They'll find one, I have no doubt. But it's good to strike back at them as hard as we can. Thank you!",""
"116521668-0-7402","Damn. Honestly, I rather hoped he misheard. I suppose that's rarely the case.nnVery well, then. I will muster the city's defenses, but there is only so much we can do. I'm certainly glad you're here. You and Razum-dar may be our best hope.",""
"116521668-0-7407","That's the first good news I've heard in a long time. The Dremora and those cursed cultists will have to find another way in now.nnI'll trade you a reward for my crystal.",""
"116521668-0-7410","You have not yet earned that knowledge, which Naemon and Pelidil took by force.nnThey went to Hectahame. Where you go is your choice, but I will be watching.",""
"116521668-0-7419","Yes. This does look like Uggissar's writing. I had hoped that his wife would convince him to give up treasure hunting, but it appears that the opposite is true.nnThank you for bringing this to me.",""
"116521668-0-7420","These … these are my mother's remains. I thought this urn had been lost forever!nnI carved the designs onto the urn myself, pictures of things my mother loved. I can't believe thieves would steal it. Thank you for returning it to me.",""
"116521668-0-7421","I did, thanks to you. Not only did I make it in time to see my sister get married, but I also decided to follow her example and become a soldier for the Skald-King.nnWe're going to drive the traitorous Stormfist out of our land!",""
"116521668-0-7422","As one story ends, another reaches its climax. Our little bit of mischief was a success: because of you, Aranias may very well betray her masters to defend the Wilderking.",""
"116521668-0-7424","Fildgor's dead? As it should be. I mourn with my father, though. nnYou've been by his side and have persevered when others would have faltered. From now on, you shall be known as the High King's Arrow, for you lead the way and always strike true.",""
"116521668-0-7431","You're right. They'll know what to do. They have to.nnDespite his rough manner, <<1>> was a hero to many in Stormhold. When this is all over, he'll have a fitting burial.",""
"116521668-0-7433","Really? That's outrageous. But that does explain what that old Nord I bought the place from was trying to tell me.nnAnyway, we'll leave the camp vacant for now. Eventually the trolls will leave. Take this for helping us. And thank you.",""
"116521668-0-7434","Thank you. I will destroy the skull and rid the world of Blackheart's menace once and for all. nnMay fortune find you wherever you go, my friend.",""
"116521668-0-7440","A Dominion general, perhaps? Whoever he is, we'll stop his march through Shadowfen.nnI'll appoint <<1>> to lead the scouts in our search for <<2>>. I swear to you, he'll account for the Dominion's terror.",""
"116521668-0-7446","I knew it. They're both too stubborn and proud to take orders from anyone. Well, at least they're alive, for now.nnThank you for letting me know.",""
"116521668-0-7451","I am too. It has been many years since the plague of necromancy visited our shores.nnThough I am relieved the docks are clear, the events of this day are extremely disturbing.",""
"116521668-0-7456","It's all right, my agent. You've done the Dominion a great service today. With Estre exposed, the Veil falls. We'll investigate her staff, her guards. We'll bring them to ground.nnYou have the thanks of a grateful Queen.",""
"116521668-0-7458","They're a blight upon our people, a prize beyond our reach. And now they're our responsibility.nn<<1>> shouldn't have gone into the ruins.",""
"116521668-0-7464","Give me the Fang. I've got a special coffer that will deaden its spell. What happened to <<1>> need not happen to anyone else.nnPoor bastard. I'll miss him. And he only had one Fang of Sithis? There should have been two. Hmm.",""
"116521668-0-7465","Give me the Fang. I've got a special coffer to shield me from its magic. What happened to <<1>> need not happen to anyone else.nnPoor bastard. I'm glad he survived. But he only had one Fang of Sithis? There should be two. Hmm.",""
"116521668-0-7469","So she believes, but there may be a greater truth to her purpose here. nnYou may not like this, but I sense the same is true of you.",""
"116521668-0-7472","This day will go down in our clan's history, and you helped make it happen! You know what? You can even keep the guardian! nnUnfortunately, I haven't figured out to keep the guardians under control for very long, but I'm working on it!",""
"116521668-0-7473","<Cirion's body is unnaturally cold. It appears his gamble was successful. High Kinlord Rilis is defeated at last, leaving both dead.>",""
"116521668-0-7485","We'll keep the Fangs safe, as well as your friend here. He will be honored by the Shadowscales for what he did.nnFor you, I have a gift. This is one of the weapons I spoke of, made in the Fangs' image. Wield it well.",""
"116521668-0-7496","You don't wish to become captain of the royal army? We apologize, but the only other position is royal consort. Though we seek to cause no offense, you simply don't intrigue us in that fashion.",""
"116521668-0-7497","<<1>>'s a monster. Over the years the coin, the skooma, they've made him cruel. Cross him and usually you end up buried in a hole out in the wastes. Kill him, and no one will mourn him.",""
"116521668-0-7500","There are still matters that must be considered.",""
"116521668-0-7505","Without your help, Namira would have corrupted our Hist tree. Her minions would have enslaved us … or destroyed us.nnPlease, take this meager reward as a token of our gratitude.",""
"116521668-0-7513","I thought I'd lost it forever to the mire. When you have so little, everything you have carries meaning.nnI erect the spine of gratitude for helping me.",""
"116521668-0-7515","We've done all we can here, but it's clear that Naemon still seeks to harm Valenwood, so our work is not finished.nnI suggest we spread out and search for signs of darkness. When Auri-El wills it, I am certain the Green will bring us together again.",""
"116521668-0-7516","We've done all we can here, but it's clear that Naemon still seeks to harm Valenwood, so our work is not finished.nnI suggest we spread out and search for signs of darkness. When Auri-El wills it, I am certain the Green will bring us together again.",""
"116521668-0-7524","I must take stock of our assets and resources. Determine just how much might we can bring to bear. Only then can I develop a strategy that shall allow us to win this war.nnBut forgive me. I wanted to convey that you performed admirably at the tower.",""
"116521668-0-7528","The Dominion ambushed us. I'd be ashamed to call it a rout, if I wasn't considering how in Oblivion they knew.nnAt least we've learned where they are, even if it's butcher's work to get them out of that place.",""
"116521668-0-7530","I take no pleasure in being right. The Dominion must have learned <<1>>'s knowledge of <<A:2>>.nnIt is imperative we learn <<A:3>>'s true role in the Dominion's plans. They bring nothing to this land but abomination.",""
"116521668-0-7534","You must gather those who were lost. King Dynar and Vanus Galerion have vital roles to play, and they must be at your side.nnRescue your missing companions. Return the Hollow City to its former glory and we can begin the assault on Molag Bal.",""
"116521668-0-7536","Thank Vivec, some good news! We'll bring the eggs to <<1>> where they'll be safe.nnYou handled yourself admirably against such odds. The Dominion would've killed half a generation of Argonians without your help!",""
"116521668-0-7538","I'll need to confer with Abnur regarding what he knows. His defection is a surprise, but it will serve only to benefit us. Mannimarco did not dispose of this asset quickly enough and now it is ours to utilize.",""
"116521668-0-7543","Thankfully, your efforts within the Shadow Wood saved many of them. But there is still much corruption in the forest; I can feel it. Our work is far from finished.nnHere. I'll take the Heart now.",""
"116521668-0-7550","This mission needs a leader. I want you to lead the assault across the Chasm.nnWe have asked so much of you and you have already accomplished the impossible, but you are one of a very small few that I would trust with this task.",""
"116521668-0-7556","The Egg is of the Hist, just like Argonians. <<1>> has performed many experiments on the swamp lizards and the Egg.nnI do not know how, but the reason why is simple: turning the Argonians against their allies would be a boon for the Dominion!",""
"116521668-0-7557","Vampires, here? Sickening. Hunted in our own hunting grounds.nnWe'll be more vigilant of their kind now. I'll see to it personally that every last one of them is destroyed.nnThank you for helping us.",""
"116521668-0-7559","The gerents brought us here from Loriasel. We were knocked out for a bit.nnToo bad we couldn't save the Hist essence. The Pact is getting a Mnemic Egg without its memories, but that's our little secret. It's a purely symbolic gesture anyway. Right?",""
"116521668-0-7561","The gerents brought us here from Loriasel. Either we'd bring the Mnemic Egg to the Pact, or they'd bring our corpses as proof of our attempt.nnI'm glad it worked out this way. A hero's welcome is better than a martyr's. But Xuth! My head hurts.",""
"116521668-0-7564","The gerents brought us here from Loriasel. We were knocked out for a while.nnYou saved the Hist. Who could have known that's what having a keystone would do? It seems the Pact gets the Mnemic Egg with its memories intact.",""
"116521668-0-7566","I will. I can't wait to see him again.nnPlease, take this. It isn't much, for I could never repay what you've done for me, but I hope it will suffice.",""
"116521668-0-7571","Wait. If only one of us makes it out, know that your efforts are incomparable. May Sithis guide your steps through darkness, and spare his touch until you wish it.",""
"116521668-0-7572","My soldiers recovered us from the ruins and kept you safe while you slept. Now I've been asked to bring <<A:1>> to the Pact, but it seems an empty shell at best.nnHence the ship. Soon it departs Shadowfen for Skyrim.",""
"116521668-0-7574","After my soldiers retrieved us from the ruins, I was asked to bring <<A:1>> to the Pact. Hence, the ship. It soon departs Shadowfen for Skyrim.nnXuth, does your head hurt? Mine feels like an overused drum!",""
"116521668-0-7577","The gerents brought us here from Loriasel. We were knocked out for a while.nnYou saved the Hist. Who could have known that's what having a keystone would do? It seems the Pact gets the Mnemic Egg with its memories intact.",""
"116521668-0-7584","Wait. Should only one of us walk from these ruins, you must allow me to thank you on behalf of Shadowfen's citizens. Sithis guide your steps in the darkness, and refrain his embrace until you will it.",""
"116521668-0-7593","A weapon once gifted to the wasp-children! Bound in blood, it slips through the Hist's dreams. Tree-blood burns, and Tree dies a lonely death, removed from its sisters.nnThe guar thanks the mighty wamasu for its mercy.",""
"116521668-0-7603","Aye, and I thank you for your charge into the fray. We might have been overrun if those horns weren't silenced.nnThis is only one of many battles to come, however. We must cut off the Maormer threat at its source.",""
"116521668-0-7607","Then we'll finish repairs and shove off at high tide. Oh, your marine friends fended off Sea Vipers while you rescued my crew. They're welcome aboard as long as they want.nnPerhaps we'll see you at <<1>>. You'll always have a place on the Prowler.",""
"116521668-0-7608","Excellent! Once the tide rises we'll get the Prowler out of here. Your marine friends are welcome to recuperate, as long as they need. nnWe'll head to <<1>> soon. You're always welcome aboard the Prowler.",""
"116521668-0-7625","I signed a new treaty with <<1>> moments ago. He assured me the Dominion will defend our little island from any reprisals, Maormer or otherwise.nn<<2>> will see much change to come. We must grow together, or we shall die apart.",""
"116521668-0-7626","Yes, the Great Shackle. Where the Planemeld begins and ends. I thought I could deal with it on my own, but I was wrong.nnYou have restored me, released me from captivity. With your continued help, we can end this threat once and for all.",""
"116521668-0-7627","I've rarely encountered a creature of <<1>>'s power. There may be a way to separate him from <<2>>, but it will take much time and study.nnShe's not just an apprentice, she's my friend. If there's a way to free her, I swear I'll find it.",""
"116521668-0-7632","No good comes from dwelling on the past. <<1>> lives, which means there's hope.nnHe's a great man, a good man. I don't care how long it takes. I'll find a way to free him from that monster.",""
"116521668-0-7633","During our time together, Zur and I determined that the Dwemer device has similarities to the method Molag Bal uses to perform the Planemeld. I will honor Zur's memory and give him credit for this discovery.nnThank you again, friend, for saving us.",""
"116521668-0-7634","During our time together, we determined that the Dwarven device operates on the same principles as Molag Bal's Planemeld. Zur will honor the Dark Elf's memory and give him credit for this discovery.nnThank you again for saving us, my friend.",""
"116521668-0-7639","You see what horrors the gods have visited upon Bruma and all who dwell here? I have nothing for Leono. He should pray to be spared our fate.nnYou have kept faith with Leono. What the gods have left me, I share with you.",""
"116521668-0-7641","You know, the spell web. A pretty elegant trap, really. I think the spell's catalyst has something to do with an interest in knowledge. I'd be insulted, but what can I say. I'm in this for adventure, not scholarly pursuits.nnAnd thanks, by the way.",""
"116521668-0-7656","By the Eight! That crystal! It is a Light of Meridia! It is said that these orbs of power once allowed Meridia to transport an entire city into Coldharbour.nnIf an agent of Meridia harnesses this power for us, we shall gain a distinct advantage.",""
"116521668-0-7663","I signed a new treaty moments ago. <<1>> assured me the Dominion will protect our little island.nnIt's a new beginning for <<2>>. We will prosper or fall—together.",""

"116521668-0-7674","It is well done. There will always be warmongers in Valenwood. So long as the Bosmer do not war amongst themselves, the Hollow's purpose is served. nnAs long as the Hollow live, there is peace between Bosmer.",""
"116521668-0-7675","Good. With the last Hollow Lord destroyed, no new Hollow should trouble us.nnOnce we clear out the remnants, we'll make for Bramblebreach.",""
"116521668-0-7676","I thought we'd never get this back. Not after Jamileh made off with it. It was bad enough she dishonored my family, then she goes and steals this? It's back now, and she's hopefully dead or worse.",""
"116521668-0-7677","She's a bright light. She might be able to shine even in Coldharbour.nnWe'll mop up the remaining Daedra and start rebuilding the outpost. Thanks to you, we won't have to fight a war on two fronts.",""

"116521668-0-7683","By Mara's golden tresses! Never expected to see those. Ordered them to woo Domitia here but turns out she married me anyway. I suppose I owe you for bringing them. Maybe Dommy will want them, wet though they are.",""
"116521668-0-7685","Rasha! Many years have passed since we warred together. The sands of Sentinel, where we met—two young warriors who faced the world together.nnThe smell of this sand evokes golden days. But those times are done, for me at least.",""
"116521668-0-7686","Thank the Divines. I don't even want to think what might have happened if the Engine's affliction had spread outside of the caverns.nnThank you for your help. We can handle it from here. Barring any more attacks from the cavern wildlife.",""

"116521668-0-7698","<<1>> warned us to keep our claws clean, but how do you learn without experiment? If you do not stretch you do not grow, as the Khajiit say.nnYet, no use denying that this time our inquisitive nature has caused us trouble. I only pray you can help.",""

"116521668-0-7727","Ha! That sneaky Tamien fellow sure will be surprised.nnHopefully now, Lady Laurent will forgive me and realize we don't need any hired help. A mercenary … what in Oblivion was she thinking?",""

"116521668-0-7776","I think I've done all I can. You're pretty tough—tougher than me, at least. You may be ready for the next fight, but I'm going to need a few minutes.nnGo on, though. With you on our side, this whole Maormer thing will be over quick, I imagine.",""
"116521668-0-7777","I thought I'd never see this again! When the Goblins attacked, I panicked and ran. If I'd known how desperately I'd need my instruments here, I would have held onto my bag.nnThank you for returning it to me!",""

"116521668-0-7836","What! I knew I shouldn't have trusted that fool to get her here. Now I'm going to have to find someone else to marry me. It wasn't easy getting Munya to agree. When Fabanil gets here, I'm going to beat him bloody.",""
"116521668-0-7847","This one knows, Hallowed. Former Mane Akkhuz-ri is here. Preparations have begun. Your path to the Two Moons Dance begins here and now.",""

"116521668-0-7911","But then, enough about the past. Khali has already laughed at my attempts to write down what happened. We have much more dangerous, immediate threats ahead of us.",""
"116521668-0-7912","Yes, I know. Her sister told us a tale of bravery and sacrifice. She said you played an important role … as you so often do. I wish we could offer you a chance to rest and recover. But rest will have to wait for another day.",""

"116521668-0-8825","The Captain set up a camp south and west of here, just across the river. She's taken a band of refugees from Crestshade under her wing, but between the vampires and the bloodfiends, she may have more on her plate than she can handle.",""
"116521668-0-8830","A modest sum, yes? And I will tell our associates of your daring plunder! Greedy Khajiit from all over Elsweyr will stumble over themselves contracting your services!",""
"116521668-0-8836","A letter? From my cousin? That's wonderful news! I'm glad to hear he made it to Stonefalls safely.nnThanks for bringing this to me, friend.",""

"116521668-0-8856","Now it is time for you to leave and for me to reap what I've sown. I was a successful jeweler in my day—take this for your troubles and go on with your life.",""
"116521668-0-8862","Excellent work! This is exactly what we were looking for. Now perhaps we can foil House Montclair's plans.nnI'll get this to the rest of the Ravenwatch first thing in the morning.",""
"116521668-0-8865","Thank you. You've given me much peace. nnI think I'll to make it my personal crusade to repopulate the spriggans here. I'll find some in Glenumbra and Viridian Wood to bring back. So perhaps we will cross paths again.",""
"116521668-0-8866","Thank you. I intend to take great care of this last little spriggan.nnWith Hircine's blessing, I hope she might be the seed to spawn many more, and that someday, a multitude of spriggans will again frolick in the waters of Jackdaw Cove.",""
"116521668-0-8867","I had no doubts you'd triumph.nnThis may not be a stronghold, but there are people who need me. We'll fight back until the Imperials are beaten, or we die in glorious battle!",""
"116521668-0-8868","Yes, Evermore needs this alliance. But I need ….nnIsabeth's sacrifice will be remembered. You've proven yourself as a great ally to Evermore. I'll agree to this alliance. Together, we'll drive out the Reachmen.",""
"116521668-0-8869","Yes. I think I judged the Baandari too soon. Silver-Paws is actually quite a gentleman … or is it a gentle-cat?nnI just hope he doesn't expect me to pay for this mead. No way. This one's on the house, and by ""the house,"" I mean ""the Baandari.""",""
"116521668-0-8871","At least you had the courtesy to politely announce yourself before just barging in on the Countess' daily devotions. That man Dorell! He has no respect.nnYou'll find Countess Eselde and the Baron inside the chapel. May the Light guide your path.",""
"116521668-0-8882","Thanks to you, we have an excellent start here in Shornhelm, and I will devote my resources to fortifying the city as quickly as possible.nnWe're secure here now and we have to ensure it remains that way.",""
"116521668-0-8883","Shornhelm must be fortified, of course. And I reluctantly find myself agreeing with the Countess—the information you uncovered about Tainted-Heart and Lleraya revealed a threat we cannot ignore.nnBut we need more information before we can act.",""
"116521668-0-8884","The Ayleid text referred to an outpost in the hills. I need to find out where that is. It may be that the answer to defeating Montclair can be found in this hidden location.nnBut first things first. There is a more urgent matter for you to deal with.",""
"116521668-0-8889","Excellent! Thank you so much for recovering the cup from that terrible Nord ruffian.nnStibbons! Oh, Stibbons! Be a dear and drink from the Emerald Chalice. I want to see how its magic works before we return it to the Mages Guild.",""
"116521668-0-8893","I'll return to Evermore to serve the crown. I am still a knight. It's my duty.nnFirst though, I will do what I came here to do. I will lay the prince to rest.",""
"116521668-0-8907","Yes, for my duty is to protect innocents from predation. A spider's poison wears off, but research and collection by the untrained can never be healed.nnI see  <<1>> walks with you. You will share my wage for doing my job.",""
"116521668-0-8918","Whether it's wise or not isn't for me to say. All I can say is that if Emeric wants to push on, I hope you will go with him.nnIt's clear that any undertaking you're a part of is more than likely to succeed.",""
"116521668-0-8923","They will try, but without the Daedra or the link to Coldharbour, destroying the remaining Worm Cultists will be quick work.nnI will warn the Dominion of what they attempted with the Fangs of Chaos. It will not be allowed to happen again.",""
"116521668-0-8927","I'll bury my friends. Then, I suppose I'll seek out more companions in the next vampire lair.nnI can't rest until this scourge is wiped from Tamriel. Zungarg and Agalir felt the same. Thank you for your help, friend.",""
"116521668-0-8928","Ah. I shouldn't be suprised. She turned her back on her family the moment she summoned the Daedra.nnThank you for your help. Now, if you'll excuse us, we have much work to do to put the house in order, and I need to hire a new steward.",""
"116521668-0-8937","Oh, Puddles, what kind of trouble did you get yourself into? nnThank you so much for bringing my adorable Puddles home, friend. Here's a small reward. I know it's not much, but I want you to have it.",""
"116521668-0-8938","I hoped your defeat of the Mad Architect would allow us to pass from this plane. Seems that was not the case.nnWe'll have to determine a new course of action—but we'll not trouble you with that. You have my thanks, friend. For everything.",""
"116521668-0-8940","We must rebuild. The Imperials tore apart our fine city, but we will rise from the sands.nnYou have given us this chance. Forever will Hallin's Stand remember your work and your sacrifices!",""
"116521668-0-8943","Here, a little present.nnI can't make you a Vinedusk Ranger, but I can give you something to show you're an honorary member. They represent the king's trust, knowing we uphold the Green Pact despite our exemption from it. You've more than earned it.",""

"116521668-0-8945","So we use silver weapons against the bloodfiends and burn bodies to stop the plague.nnThis book is practically writing itself. I'm starting to think of a sequel.",""
"116521668-0-8946","I knew I could count on you. With this interview, the Bigger Book of Bloodfiends is assured of success!",""
"116521668-0-8947","A Dominion of peace. The fair and just rule of Tamriel, beneath an Aldmeri banner. A future I hope to build.nnAnd you, standing at my side. Come, help me build the future.",""
"116521668-0-8948","I feared as much. Alas for Edweg's weakness and the evil deeds of the bandits.nnYour efforts are greatly appreciated. I have rewards for your bravery and skill in Arkay's cause.",""
"116521668-0-8950","Thanks for helping.",""
"116521668-0-8953","I watched as he died, alone and miserable. I envied him though, for I knew I would be trapped in the centurion. And for centuries I was, until you freed me.nnYou have my gratitude. I will rest now, join my family and perhaps, even, my long-lost love.",""
"116521668-0-8957","I think I, er, we have accomplished quite a bit in this short time! nnWith Stibbons rescued, and our notes gathered, I think it's time we returned to civilization and compiled our conclusions. It will be a scholarly sensation!",""
"116521668-0-8959","Best news this one has heard all day. Rivenspire will sleep easier without that monster lurking in the shadows. Maybe we should change his name to No-Blades, yes? Get it?nnAnyway, thanks for your help. It's good to see Verandis was right about you.",""
"116521668-0-8960","Oh yes, Adusa is fine. Nothing to worry about. Let's take a look at that list.nnOf course. Verandis. Adusa. And Gwendis. We're at the top of the list! That would certainly explain why they attacked the castle, yes?",""
"116521668-0-8961","Now? We fight back! These villains, they think they can strike at us where we live? They are fools and less than fools!nnWe will take the fight to them. Thanks to the information you have gathered, we know where the worm behind this hides.",""
"116521668-0-8962","This threat, yes. But don't worry. Another will appear before you know it.nnYou have been a friend to Adusa. And to Rivenspire. Stay fragrant, Five-Claw. This one is sure we will meet again some day.",""
"116521668-0-8967","Shor's bones, you did it! Thank you. With this, Marien will make a full recovery. I know it. I may even get up the nerve to ask for her hand. Heh!",""
"116521668-0-8972","I don't think so. I don't know. Maybe if I hadn't confronted him, he wouldn't have killed her….nnAt least the hostages are all right. You did your part, and you did it well.",""
"116521668-0-8978","Excellent work! This is exactly what we were looking for. Now perhaps we can foil House Montclair's plans.nnI'll get this to the rest of the Ravenwatch first thing in the morning.",""

"116521668-0-8994","My Nathalye? Worried about me? Hah! I'll make sure to tell her about that when I get back. If you help me up, Xandier can lead me back home.nnDivines watch over you, traveler.",""
"116521668-0-8997","What? How dare you—no, what am I thinking? You're right. I know you're right. Thank you for forcing me to see that.nnI need to make up my own mind and then deal with the consequences. This might be painful, but it's the only way.",""
"116521668-0-9002","I trust your decision, they shall be the one crowned. I owe you much friend. Take this as just a small token of my gratitude.",""

"116521668-0-9005","Then it's decided. Thank you for your counsel. Both Queen Eselde and myself will be in your debt.nnAfter all you've done, there's no reward that can express my gratitude, but please accept this gift. I'd feel guilty if I didn't give you something.",""
"116521668-0-9006","Then it's decided. Thank you for your counsel. Both King Alard and myself will be in your debt.nnAfter all you've done, there's no reward that can express my gratitude, but please accept this gift. I'd feel guilty if I didn't give you something.",""
"116521668-0-9012","She did? That is funny, but I do not expect she will follow through.nnRegardless of her path though, I am grateful she will not interfere with mine, and for that, I have you to thank.",""
"116521668-0-9013","With <<1>> appeased, we will continue to do what we do best. While I am sure Jode's Chariot will try to stop us, they will never blot us out entirely, no?nnThank you, my friend. We would not be here without your help.",""
"116521668-0-9014","As long as the two of you weren't injured. That would have been tragic.nnWell, we'll all sleep a little better knowing that the dead have been laid to rest. Take this as a token of my appreciation.",""
"116521668-0-9015","Consider it returned. The grotto belongs to the Wyrd once again, but more importantly, to you.nnI'll be watching you, mortal. A larger hunt looms in your future, one I'll watch with great interest.",""
"116521668-0-9017","Just give me a second, and I'll head back home. I knew <<1>> wouldn't leave me here to rot.nn<<2>> will be worried sick. Thank you!",""
"116521668-0-9025","I will never forgive myself for the misery I have caused. At least no one else will suffer from my folly, thanks to you. Take this for your troubles.",""
"116521668-0-9026","Now I must reap what I've sown. Take this for your part in ending the curse I created.nnGo in peace, my friend.",""
"116521668-0-9031","He returned to me just before you arrived. We decided to move out to Cyrodiil with our sister, <<1>>. I'm ready, and I think it will make him happy. I'd rather see him work in a grand Keep than in a criminal den.",""
"116521668-0-9036","I think so. All in one piece, anyway. If it weren't for you, I'd be spider meat. Thanks again.",""
"116521668-0-9040","We'll interrogate <<1>> until we know the extent of her treason. Then she'll die, as all traitors must.nnBut no matter. Your efficiency in resolving this matter was commendable, and the Dominion rewards its servants.",""
"116521668-0-9041","That's my sister's journal. So sweet but so young and foolish. She was obsessed with the idea that trolls could be socialized.nnI knew this day would eventually come. I think it's time for another cup of mead. Thanks.",""
"116521668-0-9042","That's a strange way to put it, but Adusa will not pry. I'm disappointed we can't interrogate the informer, but the threat has been taken care of.nnThank you.",""
"116521668-0-9043","I wish there was something I could give you by way of gratitude. But I'm an Elf of little means, and this pittance is all I have. It will have to be enough. Thank you.",""
"116521668-0-9044","Glad to hear that bastard's been dealt with. Would have ripped his tail off and beat him with it, if I had my way.nnAt least we can focus on Northpoint now.",""
"116521668-0-9051","<<1>> remains true to its name, then. I'm sorry to hear it. <<2>> might have been a dunderheaded double-crosser, but he was still my friend.nnI figure I owe you what the treethane paid me for the bow. Some thief I turned out to be, eh?",""
"116521668-0-9053","Not much. You've done extraordinary work. And just in time for <<1>>'s arrival!",""
"116521668-0-9060","I'm not sure. There are so many memories here, but we can't keep the farm in good order with just the two of us.nnMayla and I might travel for awhile. Visit Shornhelm. Or Wayrest. We'll make a new life for ourselves, thanks to you.",""
"116521668-0-9064","<<1>>'s dead? Sad news, even if he did steal this bow from me.nnIt's a good thing you found it. I sort of owed it to a local treethane. Long story. I hope you'll accept this for a reward.",""
"116521668-0-9066","Were you indeed?nn<<1>> sent you from <<2>>, did she? A bit dramatic of her, but she does have an eye for talented people. Perhaps you could put your talents to use.",""
"116521668-0-9070","Ah, thrilling. I can just imagine the heroics. I'm sorry—most of the pleasures of old age are vicarious. nnAt least I still have my research, which you've helped immensely, I must add. Thank you.",""
"116521668-0-9071","So we use silver to fight bloodfiends and holy water on corpses to stop the plague.nnI'll be done with this book in no time.",""
"116521668-0-9072","So fire is doubly effective—use burning oil to kill bloodfiends and burn bodies to stop the plague.nnI have plenty of material for my book. Maybe I should spread it out into two books for twice the profits!",""
"116521668-0-9073","So we fight bloodfiends with fire and protect the bodies with water. Amusing.nnThat just about finishes my book. I'm already thinking of writing a second one.",""
"116521668-0-9074","I need time to deal with this. I can't believe I'll never see Nedras again.nnThank … thank you for telling me the truth about him. Green keep you, stranger.",""
"116521668-0-9075","When I find Nedras, he's going to have some explaining to do!nnThank you for telling me. If you'll excuse me, I need to start planning how to track down my good-for-nothing brother!",""
"116521668-0-9076","May Jone, Jode, and Yenadar watch you on the road, traveler. Kala's brother will be guiding your steps. She can feel it.",""
"116521668-0-9077","Good luck on the road, traveler. And if you find Kala's brother before she does, tell him he will need the blessings of Jone and Jode both to avoid my claws. Bah!",""
"116521668-0-9078","That's it, I've decided. Men are all mules. I'm going to march right over to the Dead Wolf, get ripping drunk. Maybe tomorrow I'll join the city guard. Bah!nnThanks for telling me, I guess. If you'll excuse me?",""
"116521668-0-9079","No, no. You know what? Don't apologize. This is just what I needed to hear. I'll go straight away to talk to Lorbash at the smithy. This is a new chapter for me!nnThank you for setting me straight, stranger.",""
"116521668-0-9080","His lordship, the Baron over there, wants us to head inside, see what's going on, and secure the area. He wants us to be slow and careful so as not to damage his precious city.nnGood job getting that key, by the way. Now let's go save Northpoint.",""
"116521668-0-9081","Something no mortal's ever seen, until that nasty woman went in there, of course … and who knows what she might have done to the place …?nnI guess you'll be finding out soon enough though.",""
"116521668-0-9085","Once a pup, now a wolf. Once prey, now a hunter. The blood of the true hunter, and the pack, is now yours. They are your only family, your only allegiance.nnHunt well.",""
"116521668-0-9086","You are free of Hircine's corruption. You were brave to face and kill his horrific beasts. Should you become infected again, you need only return to me and receive my blessing.",""
"116521668-0-9091","No need to wait …nnYes, of course! She ordered me to summon her when everything was ready. But first, I must … thank you. I did not expect you to be so helpful when we first met. What you have done will make history.",""
"116521668-0-9092","Excellent. To be honest, I wasn't sure you would return at all. nnThis is a favorable turn. Now we can secure this area and ensure it is not a weak link in our defense of the region. You have my gratitude.",""
"116521668-0-9093","Relish this new life I have given you. Feed and grow powerful.nnFind others of our kind. Form families. Bring new children into the fold!",""
"116521668-0-9094","We'll proceed as planned. These ruins are too interesting to leave, despite our unhappy first impression.nnYou there, take this pittance as a reward. I need to have a word with my guide.",""
"116521668-0-9096","A gruesome trophy, to be sure, but we've thought him dead twice before, only to learn how painfully wrong we were.nnThere are many grieving families who will rejoice to hear of Sgolag's death. Here's your reward. It's well-earned.",""
"116521668-0-9101","You can't know what this means to me. This was my life's work. Everything I've learned in twenty years of studying kwama.nnI thought I was going to have to give up, find something new. Thank you so much.",""
"116521668-0-9103","Yes, of course. To Oblivion with this whole campaign folly, and the Seventh Legion. nnAs you can see, my men are securing their gear and preparing for the march back to Cyrodiil. It's a long journey, but it'll be good to fight where we're needed.",""
"116521668-0-9106","I hope that she is. Perhaps killing me will grant her some solace. She deserves justice. nnI deserve to die.",""
"116521668-0-9107","Yes, of course. I'm sorry … for everything. Gods, what have I done ….",""
"116521668-0-9108","Don't you recognize the old beggar without his rags? I've been following you for quite a while! Even my own followers suspected nothing.nnDhakir and Qismah will never forget what you've done for them.",""
"116521668-0-9109","She is in no shape to fight. I can't imagine what tortures she must have endured under the Imperials' reign.nnYou are our symbol, friend. Our symbol of freedom.",""
"116521668-0-9112","You bet your arse there is. Queen Maraya's messenger said she had heard rumors, and I guess they were true … or something.nnGo talk to Captain Marck. He actually walked a little ways down the dock. Better he tells you about it himself.",""
"116521668-0-9113","Oh, yes … I must always finish what my sister starts. In this case, it involves thanking you. You've been an excellent errand boy, and I should know!nnStill, the Dominion requires more of both of us.",""
"116521668-0-9114","Then accept the gift of Eidetic Memory. Remember now every tome, every book, every scrap of paper you have ever read.nnAnd remember, too, the tale of Eyevea's return to Tamriel, and the story of the Adept who made it happen.",""
"116521668-0-9119","Fantastic. Hold still for a moment, you may have a few seconds of confusion.",""
"116521668-0-9125","Shrouded Pass? That means Montclair is in the Doomcrag! Then the time has come to strike down the traitor and restore peace to our shores!nnBut first, I want to thank you for helping the people of Northpoint. I won't forget your bravery.",""
"116521668-0-9130","The crown is here somewhere, I can feel it in my bones! If only we could get one of these skeletons to talk to us. If only we could speak to someone who was with King Ranser at the end.",""
"116521668-0-9132","What? Do you know how long we've been … well, no matter. That crown represents the key to creating a lasting peace in Rivenspire. Thank you for recovering it.nnI will get this crown into King Emeric's hands,",""
"116521668-0-9136","It is <<1>>'s duty to send those who measure up to our standards. She doesn't take her task lightly.",""
"116521668-0-9139","Oh, I see. My apologies then. She had been after me to aid her, but I saw it as her usual nagging. Maybe she really does need someone. I should go and see her. You have my thanks for the kindness you showed her. I'll tell her you kept your word.",""
"116521668-0-9143","We'll perform our hearts out! The Wood Elves will see there's more to the Summerset Isles than stuffy politicians.nnReturn anytime you wish. If there's enough call for it, we may have new performances to share!",""
"116521668-0-9144","I suppose so. Furthermore, I'm grateful now that Septima never returned my affections. Mara's mercy, that woman did not age well!nnShe's irrelevant now though, thanks to you. I suspect, however, that we can't afford to rest on our laurels just yet.",""
"116521668-0-9147","Edouard Celd? Really? It's always the ones you least suspect. We'll learn much from Edouard, though he may not be a willing teacher.nnThank you for your help.",""
"116521668-0-9152","It's obvious, isn't it my dear? Don't make me … spell it out for you.nnI'll say, they do wonders for the figure. Especially if you're looking to grow fungal curves … Ha!",""
"116521668-0-9158","Enough? This is more than I even dreamed of. I think this might even allow me to piece together the complete tablet! Variations in the runes, slightly altered structure … yes, yes, this is very exciting!",""
"116521668-0-9162","Hmph. Don't care to keep company with your old granny Alyxe? Or is it the smell of boiling kwama? A little too heady for your delicate sensibilities?nnOh, well. I'll enjoy it all for myself. I always do!",""
"116521668-0-9164","Without Naruk, the Children of Yokuda will crumble. No one can say King Fahara'jad did not deal them justice. The Daggerfall Covenant is safe, and so am I, thanks to you.nnNow have a drink with us and celebrate our victory.",""
"116521668-0-9167","Yes. The blood-curse is gone from you.nnTerrible dangers, such as werewolves and vampires, crawl in the darkness. Should you fall victim to their infection, know I will lift the evil with the light of Arkay.",""
"116521668-0-9173","Hurry along then. You will find the king just up the road.  nnI am going to scale this wall and try to get more details on the Imperials' defenses. I will join you shortly.",""
"116521668-0-9174","You've found the notes! Oh, superb. I'm sure I can cobble these together and keep the high points on the voyage.nnI might even make the two of them my co-authors—no, no that's absurd! Here, a pittance for your trouble.",""
"116521668-0-9178","How exciting! We still have much to learn about the Ayleids that settled here. I am most glad you sought me out with this.",""
