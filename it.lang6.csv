"55049764-2-5476","With you taking care of Varnedo, I can relax a bit. nnMight see if those Nords really know how to drink.",""
"55049764-2-5477","Discover anything new?",""
"55049764-2-5478","You have questions, new friend?",""
"55049764-2-5479","So, everything work out all right?",""
"55049764-2-5480","I'm resting up. Talk to me another time.",""
"55049764-2-5481","<A small pouch sits inside the hollow tree>",""
"55049764-2-5485","You. You're not with them? Quickly, get me out of here!",""
"55049764-2-5486","Remember. No is not an acceptable answer.",""
"55049764-2-5491","Quickly, take the side tunnel to return to the entrance!",""
"55049764-2-5492","You've returned! I thank you again for your help.nnTwo-Blades would like to speak with you.",""
"55049764-2-5493","You arrived just in time.",""
"55049764-2-5494","Be wary, traveler. This corruption could take you, too!",""
"55049764-2-5497","Find my father, outsider. And the rest of the villagers, too.",""
"55049764-2-5499","This one has no time for talk now. I must tend to this poor man. Though I fear with the reagents I have on hand… there may be little more I can do.",""
"55049764-2-5501","Hope it's going well for you.",""
"55049764-2-5502","Oh, dear! Did my champion lose his nerve? Please, you must stop Cracktooth!",""
"55049764-2-5506","Well, from the time you've spent in there, I think we may be onto something.",""
"55049764-2-5508","How goes the stealing of the blades? Don't let me down.",""
"55049764-2-5509","Clever, using the back exit. You might have a future with us. How'd it go in there?",""
"55049764-2-5512","Greetings. What can I do for you?",""
"55049764-2-5513","Oh, I hope they are safe.",""
"55049764-2-5515","Did you find my boy, Ulfslod?",""
"55049764-2-5517","They're stocking something in the hut off to the west. Might be worth checking out.",""
"55049764-2-5519","Lodorr's Crown isn't here.",""
"55049764-2-5522","Woo-hoo!",""
"55049764-2-5526","I need another drink. Let's find my friends and get out of this accursed place.",""
"55049764-2-5527","I see you've found one of my friends. Good to know they haven't all been eaten.",""
"55049764-2-5529","You should have seen the fish I almost caught. It was a small whale.",""
"55049764-2-5531","You have the pleasure of speaking with High Kinlady Estre, scion of royal Aldmeri blood. I must apologize, but my escort and I were just in the middle of a conversation. If you'll excuse us?",""
"55049764-2-5532","Bit busy here, if you don't mind?",""
"55049764-2-5533","Welcome to Vulkhel Guard!",""
"55049764-2-5534","A very fitting look for you.",""
"55049764-2-5535","Interesting, so I see Mom's got you on a job. I hope it goes well.",""
"55049764-2-5536","I saw those three drunkards stumble out of here. I assume you had something to do with that. Should have left them to the Draugr if you ask me. nnBut I guess you didn't ask me, did you?",""
"55049764-2-5537","That's the end of the coven, but we still need to get out of here.",""
"55049764-2-5538","Could it be I made the wrong choice?",""
"55049764-2-5539","Eranamo was a good mer. He only wanted to do what he thought was right in his heart.",""
"55049764-2-5540","Right. Now we can go find my sister.",""
"55049764-2-5542","My daughter doesn't deserve this fate!",""
"55049764-2-5543","The voice could've lied about everything. But if I don't try, we'll both be cursed.nnShe's in such a daze. I'd hate for her to know what's happening right now.",""
"55049764-2-5546","It's great to meet you at the gate again. Just like the last time!",""
"55049764-2-5547","Estre must pay for this.",""
"55049764-2-5548","Ah, good. Raz was beginning to worry about you.",""
"55049764-2-5552","Zaban. What happened here, damn it?",""
"55049764-2-5553","Have you finished your tour yet? Make sure to have a run at some of the students. Can't have you telling the Queen we're slacking.",""
"55049764-2-5554","I see you survived. The Ra Gada sure are mad — well done!nnI still haven't recovered enough to cast the disguise ritual on myself, but there's more to be done, anyway.",""
"55049764-2-5555","Sorry. Can't talk.",""
"55049764-2-5556","Those Redguard shouldn't be here. Drinking my booze, stirring up trouble. Sure, we don't always get along with the Wood Elves that well, but what they're doing ain't right.nnGet my booze back and everything'll be fine, though.",""
"55049764-2-5557","Bravely done.",""
"55049764-2-5558","Let's show these Bloodthorn cultists what for!",""
"55049764-2-5559","What I am going to do with that fool Orc. He'll never make it in the Lion Guard.",""
"55049764-2-5560","Two altars broken and still I can sense the Canonreeve's magic. There must be one remaining. Find it and you may find <<1>>.nnBe wary if you do—her power has grown immensely if these altars are any indication.",""
"55049764-2-5563","There are two loyal soldiers and one traitor out there. I need you to sort them out!",""
"55049764-2-5565","Hurry it up, will you?",""
"55049764-2-5566","You're freeing us? Are you going to free me, too?",""
"55049764-2-5567","I may have exaggerated a bit. My apologies.",""
"55049764-2-5568","Hurry, please. They could be back any minute!",""
"55049764-2-5569","Greetings. Did Baham send you to this one?",""
"55049764-2-5572","I'm sorry. I have to get back to practice.",""
"55049764-2-5573","I'm sorry. I have to get back to practice.",""
"55049764-2-5574","I'm sorry. I have to get back to practice.",""
"55049764-2-5575","That went better than expected. Now, just do your part ….",""
"55049764-2-5577","My friend, you are unbelievably quick! <<1>> hopes the ladies don't also say this to you as well, eh?nnBut no matter… you have bested the hourglass, and so you may choose a treasure from my private collection. Congratulations.",""
"55049764-2-5578","Students always complain about our difficult curriculum.nnOf course it's difficult! This is Shad Astula, not the Mages Guild.",""
"55049764-2-5579","Just don't snort the cinnamon. That's bad for you.",""
"55049764-2-5580","Don't stand here with your mouth open. Go!",""
"55049764-2-5581","Reinforcements are on the way. Move. We need that thing up.",""
"55049764-2-5587","I can't believe this is happening to me.",""
"55049764-2-5588","You've come to test your mind? Learn if you have what it takes?",""
"55049764-2-5589","It's only a matter of time before we take the fight to Daggerfall, mark my words.",""
"55049764-2-5590","Thank you. One day, perhaps Ilara's dreams will return. Return to normal.",""
"55049764-2-5591","I'm impressed … and relieved. Memories in this part of the Silvenar's mind tend to be unpleasant at best, deadly at worst. You've proven yourself his true friend.nnI'll help you.",""
"55049764-2-5592","Good work. You're tougher than you look.",""
"55049764-2-5595","Why did you come here? Velian will kill you.",""
"55049764-2-5596","I've dosed Len with enough healing potion so that he'll sleep for hours. Once he's feeling better, these rogues better be gone.nnOtherwise, he'll just try to fight them again.",""
"55049764-2-5598","Congratulations, you beat up some weaklings.",""
"55049764-2-5599","Well. You've got some backbone. Good for you.",""
"55049764-2-5602","Those Bloodthorn cultists ran out of the village like a dragon was chasing them! Glad we had our weapons ready. We cut them down without breaking a sweat.nnDame Clarique wants to know what happened in there when you get a chance.",""
"55049764-2-5604","They'll get what's coming to them, one way or another.",""
"55049764-2-5605","You better get moving. Lyris may need your help.nnI'm going to stay here and make sure the Daedra don't get through.",""
"55049764-2-5606","I'm very grateful for your help. I wanted to help these people, but I couldn't have done it without you.",""
"55049764-2-5608","Here we are. The very embodiment of the Green Lady can be see in this ancient tree.",""
"55049764-2-5609","Fair day! I've been given instructions. Razum-dar needs to speak with you, at once.",""
"55049764-2-5610","Oh Divines, they're going to torture us horribly for that one. But it's worth it just to stick in their craw. Ha!",""
"55049764-2-5611","How do you like that, you Daedra bastards? That felt good.",""
"55049764-2-5612","Damned Daedra. I was a slave in life, and now a slave in death. I'll make them pay for this!",""
"55049764-2-5613","Ah, Lyris. Bit of an idealist, that one. Says she's determined to save us all from eternal torment. Heart's in the right place, I suppose, but the girl's as mad as Sheogorath's jammies.",""
"55049764-2-5621","The captain sent you? Thank Mara.",""
"55049764-2-5622","By the blessings of Tava! Fine work, my friend. nnI have no love of Imperials, but I rejoice in their custom of hoarding weapons. Still, I would not wish this fate on anyone, even my enemies. The Planemeld is far from an instrument of mercy.",""
"55049764-2-5625","I hope we're in time.",""
"55049764-2-5629","Take another look into the rooms before you head down into the library. If there are illusion spells, you'll need every edge you can get.",""
"55049764-2-5631","Were you able to find some petals from Kyne's Tears? They are so hard to find.",""
"55049764-2-5633","As I feared, we arrived in different locations. I am in a place with the smell of burning ash on a hot wind and the sounds of a distant battle. nnIt matters not. You have awakened once again and we must set you on your path.",""
"55049764-2-5635","Find the leader of the side you have chosen and present yourself. I'm eager to see how the game plays out with you involved.",""
"55049764-2-5636","Did you speak to Nelhilda? Smart lass, my daughter. Very smart.",""
"55049764-2-5642","If you're looking for work, there's better to be had elsewhere. The forge is suited for the lesser races, particularly those cats. nnAlmost hate to see the Bosmer work the forge. Mer should stick by mer.",""
"55049764-2-5651","Once I destroy the wards, we can get inside the vault. No problems after that. I'm sure!",""
"55049764-2-5652","Sithis blind me! Be there other living mortals in this wretched waste? You're the first swab I've seen who still has meat on their bones.",""
"55049764-2-5653","Thanks for the bait. Maybe them fish will start biting now.",""
"55049764-2-5654","I wouldn't go into town if I were you. Just keep on to Firsthold.",""
"55049764-2-5655","I hope he's all right.",""
"55049764-2-5656","Me crew is dead. Looks like we be the only living things left in this wretched place.",""
"55049764-2-5657","If you keep the Admiral distracted, I'll convince his crew to join with me … er … us. Without a crew, a captain is powerless.nnExcept for me, of course.",""
"55049764-2-5658","The Amulet is secure, sir.",""
"55049764-2-5659","I wonder how much that Amulet is worth on its own, without the whole magic bit.nnWhat? Idle thoughts, don't look at me like that.",""
"55049764-2-5660","These Daedra deal most generously in the currency of pain.",""
"55049764-2-5661","The face is still good, yeah? Good.",""
"55049764-2-5664","Excuse me, please. I must look for her ring. Can't leave without it.",""
"55049764-2-5665","You're a stubborn one, mate, I'll give you that.",""
"55049764-2-5666","I know a few of the House Hlaalu guards. I heard how you helped them find a cure for the plague.",""
"55049764-2-5678","Enter the portal and find the source of the power I sense emanating from the other side.",""
"55049764-2-5679","Please find my husband! His name is Pirtar. He was still in the house when the roof fell in!",""
"55049764-2-5680","The attack was so sudden. We barely made it out alive.",""
"55049764-2-5681","The Daedra. Everywhere. Damn those things are fast.",""
"55049764-2-5696","Thank the Eight! Please tell me the Marines have arrived.",""
"55049764-2-5697","Thank the Divines I found you. nnYou need to find Landare. She's in over her head.",""
"55049764-2-5699","I feel my strength returning. I should be as good as new in a few days.",""
"55049764-2-5701","The guards are quiet again. Something's happened.nnWhere's my son? Where's Sorondil?",""
"55049764-2-5706","Bernt gave my lute back. It feels right to have it in my hands again.nnI showed great promise when I was young and Bernt had it made for me. Sent all the way from Windhelm and made by the finest lute crafter in the land.",""
"55049764-2-5713","Why is … why is Angof helping me?nnWhat … what's going on here?",""
"55049764-2-5714","Are you mad? You decided to help Thallik? Willingly? How can you imagine that was a good idea?nnThis one hopes you know what you're doing.",""
"55049764-2-5716","Look at me! I'm a flaming nix!",""
"55049764-2-5726","<Raynor Vanos is sound asleep.>",""
"55049764-2-5727","I had friends and allies once. Companions who would never abandon me, no matter the cost. But that was before. Before I became this … monster.nnEnough! I must find the magic to restore my human form.",""
"55049764-2-5729","Hey there. Ever spend any time staring at your own corpse?nnI don't recommend it.",""
"55049764-2-5730","<Lady Laurent doesn't seem to hear you.>",""
"55049764-2-5734","Off with you. Off!nnSpill blood. Stab things. Do what you do best!",""
"55049764-2-5735","The shadow wanted my help, but I never asked what it wanted me to do. I … I just gave up.nnIf you can find the shadow, maybe we'll have a chance. I … I just don't know.",""
"55049764-2-5736","Defeat the champions of Angof and Thallik. Then we can have a proper celebration!nnAnd remember, should you need assistance, use my mask of shadows. I think you'll enjoy what happens after that.",""
"55049764-2-5739","I hope you're not here to kill Goblins. If you are, we'll have a problem.",""
"55049764-2-5740","You did it! You've returned my crewmates! My friends.",""
"55049764-2-5741","I hope that our warriors are strong enough to aid you in the coming battle.",""
"55049764-2-5749","You are interfering. The fate of the old tavern keeper and his patrons is none of your concern.",""
"55049764-2-5752","It's been years since I spilled blood in the field. Ah, the memories.",""
"55049764-2-5764","You look to be young and able. Please say you'll help.nnThe Nurin farm has been burned down and Mister Nurin has disappeared. It's very serious.",""
"55049764-2-5765","I feel sorry for Rosalie, but there's nothing more these old bones can do.nnI only stayed on the farm these last few years for William's sake, and I hate to say it, but I think he died in the fire.",""
"55049764-2-5770","I failed.",""
"55049764-2-5772","If I lose my pack beasts and all my money, I'm doomed. I might as well die here.",""
"55049764-2-5773","Your valiant rescue of the First Auridon Marines was well-timed. They've driven off the last of the imposters.nnWhat news of the traitor, Teldur? Was Canonreeve Valano injured?",""
"55049764-2-5775","Masterful! Did you take dance lessons, or are you naturally graceful?nnI suppose I shouldn't tease. You did much better than I would have. I'm sure <<1>> will appreciate your hard work.",""
"55049764-2-5776","Return once you've convinced Drulis to do his job. If he won't, perhaps you'd undertake it.",""
"55049764-2-5777","We just need to hold a little longer.",""
"55049764-2-5779","I knew Nelhilda would hate me for this.nnI almost said I would give anything for her forgiveness, but I've learned the dangers of making wishes.",""
"55049764-2-5784","The observatory is just below us.",""
"55049764-2-5786","We'll keep the pirates off your tail, I swear it!",""
"55049764-2-5787","They attacked the lighthouse? But why? That doesn't make any sense.nnCan I see these plans?",""
"55049764-2-5790","You're a clever one. I figured this would all end in bloodshed. Turning an Orc's wounded pride against him is no easy task.",""
"55049764-2-5791","We'll distract the pirates while you slip into the Fighters Guild.nnHurry, before they can arm their undead with every weapon in that building.",""
"55049764-2-5792","Please, don't let her take me back! I'll give back the trinkets, but I can't go back!",""
"55049764-2-5793","She's my property, as surely as that locket is. But if you're determined to free her, there's nothing I can do about it. You're the one who's armed here, after all.",""
"55049764-2-5794","We must stop the Daedra before they can steal the Amulet!",""
"55049764-2-5795","Is it done? Is <<1>> dead?",""
"55049764-2-5796","Ask questions later. You need to get spriggan bark so we can save your remaining friend.",""
"55049764-2-5797","Ifriz isn't in the Fighters Guild? I don't understand how I could have been so mistaken.",""
"55049764-2-5798","Watch out for Captain Angarthal—his axes are stained with the blood of more sailors than I can count. He's a monster. nnHey though. If you're feeling tough, I say take that bastard out. Won't hear any complaints from me.",""
"55049764-2-5799","It's all my fault. We wouldn't be out here if it weren't for me.",""
"55049764-2-5800","He left a note? I don't know how to mix the ingredients!nnMaybe you can figure it out his word-play. There must be something in the way he described the ingredients. Take a look at his note again.",""
"55049764-2-5801","Don't dawdle with me, get the Amulet!",""
"55049764-2-5802","The Amulet is safe, but it looks like whatever it did drained its power.",""
"55049764-2-5805","I have nothing to say to you.",""
"55049764-2-5806","Oh, hello. Guess I should've expected to see you around. Not that it isn't good to see you, but ….nnWhy are you here, exactly?",""
"55049764-2-5807","Why would you say that about my mother?  You don't even know her!  You can pass the ""Or Step"" test case … jerk.",""
"55049764-2-5808","We have nothing to discuss. I'll meet you below.",""
"55049764-2-5809","Sai Sahan is one of the greatest warriors of the age. He shall be a powerful ally in battle.",""
"55049764-2-5817","What happened? Why did <<1>> sound so strange?",""
"55049764-2-5820","Sorry, but Master Tuunerol is currently away. I can't grant you access without his express permission.",""
"55049764-2-5821","The race is on!",""
"55049764-2-5822","It's … surprising to get help from a stranger out here. Thank you.nnThree journals should be enough. Knowing the whoreson dogs that live out here—I mean that literally—I'm assuming at least one was eaten or defecated on.",""
"55049764-2-5823","Uh, can I help you? Very busy here.",""
"55049764-2-5824","Can I help you? Just watching the races. Noting that Snooks is a superior specimen in almost every way.",""
"55049764-2-5825","What do you want? Look at you, weakling. Even my frog could rip you apart.",""
"55049764-2-5826","It should be easy to grab those baubles and get back before anyone's the wiser.",""
"55049764-2-5827","A mother shouldn't outlive her children. And I've had four pass on to Aetherius. It's almost too much to bear.",""

"55049764-2-5836","What is it now?",""
"55049764-2-5837","Bandits rushed the gates and scaled the walls. There's not enough of us to drive them back!",""

"55049764-2-5842","You don't fool me! It looks like you're helping us, but I know you must be up to something.nnJust remember that I'm keeping my eye on you.",""
"55049764-2-5845","Statues with living eyes. They were always watching! And the bones ….",""
"55049764-2-5846","Ah, my arms! I thought they were going to fall off.nnI'm glad the eyeball was worth it. So good when a theory works in practice, you know?",""

"55049764-2-5851","Well, did you add our special ingredient to the Imperials' food?",""
"55049764-2-5856","Ready?",""
"55049764-2-5859","Hello, murderous. We both expect to see you at the estate. nnYou don't want to disappoint us, do you?",""
"55049764-2-5860","As mud is my mother, what is the Canonreeve planning?nnThe air is tinged with an aura of magic I've never felt before.",""
"55049764-2-5861","What an obscure ritual. I've never seen its like. Seems Bakkhara was right, and the Canonreeve is no mere politician.nnPerhaps I wasn't wasted on this mission after all.",""
"55049764-2-5862","You need something. I can tell.",""
"55049764-2-5863","Ah, the little meddler. Enjoying yourself so far? You're like a Dwemer toy that doesn't need to be wound up. You do all the work yourself and I just watch and smile.",""
"55049764-2-5869","Welcome to Sentinel, grunt. I wish I could have gotten some of that action on the docks. But, you know—politics. nnTake a moment to look around. We've got all the tools of the trade. Point one out and we'll make a deal.",""
"55049764-2-5885","Be quiet! That thing might hear! We can speak after it's gone.",""
"55049764-2-5887","Now that Vox no longer threatens us, I'm sure things will return to normal.",""
"55049764-2-5888","Tell me, was the entrance to the crypt breached?",""
"55049764-2-5889","Thank you for helping search for my family's remains.",""
"55049764-2-5890","As you see, Headman Bhosek's trust in my skills was not misplaced. Nor was my faith in your prowess.nnWill you assist me on another task?",""
"55049764-2-5892","The traitors lost their fight once you killed <<1>>. I'd rather hang the lot of them, but <<2>> said some were coerced into it.nnEven so, they'll need some kind of punishment.",""
"55049764-2-5893","Yes? Is it done?",""
"55049764-2-5894","Auri-El watch your steps. I'm very excited about this project. Shalidor's sanctuary would be a boon to every mage in Tamriel. Even Guildmaster Vanus approves of our work here!",""
"55049764-2-5895","If there's anything consistent about Sheogorath, it's his knack for surprises. nnCome. Let's return to Valaste now that you've recovered the second book.",""
"55049764-2-5897","Are you still on the first act? Very good. A true professional always prolongs the first act.",""
"55049764-2-5898","I hope that goblin chief understands your generosity in sparing him. We'll take charge from here. With any luck, we can relocate Koth and his tribe.nnAnd thank you for dealing with Nelanya so I wouldn't have to. I've found quite the boon in you.",""
"55049764-2-5899","The mutiny's over? He's dead?nnOh, it's done! I think I need to sit down.",""
"55049764-2-5900","How did it go, dearie? The faithful have been served at Baan Dar's bar, yes?",""
"55049764-2-5901","Be on guard if you're headed up to the castle. King Fahara'jhad's army is camped outside the walls.nnThey claim they're here in a diplomatic capacity, but I'm not buying it.",""
"55049764-2-5902","Listen to this braggart. Claims he could drop us all with a hand behind his back. The nerve.nnAnd King Fahara'jad claims these warriors are here in a diplomatic capacity? Preposterous!",""
"55049764-2-5903","Byz not get in way! Let Byz alone!",""
"55049764-2-5904","So you haven't been briefed? News travels slower than honeymead in the field.",""
"55049764-2-5905","Good, you have arrived.",""
"55049764-2-5908","Are you expecting me to fetch it for you? I'm no servant of yours, mortal.",""
"55049764-2-5909","You! You're the one who rescued me from those slavers in Koeglin. nnI can't thank you enough. They would have killed me for certain.",""
"55049764-2-5910","What you want? Go away!",""
"55049764-2-5911","Shazah and I rarely agree on anything. But your role in the Dance … this could be important. Not important like the monks and their books. Actually important.",""
"55049764-2-5913","You're not changing your mind, are you? Please don't!",""
"55049764-2-5916","You look like you know something of my father. Tell me.",""
"55049764-2-5919","If it isn't too much trouble, would you bring me the skulls of the Imperial mages? It will allow me to stop the ritual that sustains me in this terrible fashion.",""
"55049764-2-5920","Shazah wasn't sure to believe you … couldn't believe you. But it is true. You are the Moon Hallowed!",""
"55049764-2-5922","This is very exciting!",""
"55049764-2-5923","My ""husband,"" Quintus Verres, is around here somewhere. He's got every scrap of research I've done on these ruins and the Guardian's Eye. I need my materials back.",""
"55049764-2-5924","If you are wounded, you may take a bed in the corner. I will tend to you as soon as I can.",""
"55049764-2-5925","Can you get the sword for me? I'll prepare the stinking flesh needed to lure out the beast. It's Mother's special recipe.",""
"55049764-2-5926","You're back. Good. Do you know what this cult is planning?",""
"55049764-2-5931","Ugh. My head thanks you for your haste. Once the barrier fell, whatever she was doing stopped as well!",""
"55049764-2-5938","It was horrible. They descended like wolves.nnIf Dark hadn't been with me, I don't want to imagine what they might have done.",""
"55049764-2-5939","I am to protect Eling at any cost. I did not fail. nnThe bandits made off with some of our goods, but Eling is uninjured. That is what is important.",""
"55049764-2-5940","You aren't a cultist, are you? Please. Help me! They took me from my tribe!",""
"55049764-2-5941","Hello to you, Aniel's friend. This one wishes we had brought more moon-sugar with us. Roasts always taste better lathered in sweet.",""
"55049764-2-5943","I'm not proud of what we've decided to do, but we might as well get it over with.",""
"55049764-2-5946","A bit rusty, but not bad! So funny, watching you mortals muck around with things you can't possibly understand.nnI'll be needing that back, now.",""
"55049764-2-5947","As I expected. <<1>> is hiding something, but I don't know what.nnGood thing we've already planned for this. Are you ready for a little subterfuge?",""
"55049764-2-5951","Can't wait to see the look on <<1>>'s face when I prank her this year.nnHello there, stranger! Having fun at the festival?",""
"55049764-2-5952","You have the <<1>>? This is going to be amazing!",""
"55049764-2-5953","Quick, follow him! Don't lose the courier!nnYou've got to be the first person to find him when the poison takes hold. I'll meet you at the farm.",""
"55049764-2-5957","Good. You made it! Thank you for rallying these brave men and women. We stand a chance now!",""
"55049764-2-5958","You don't belong here.",""
"55049764-2-5960","Remember, get arms caches and bring to Khajiit out by the shoreline. He will have your money waiting for you.",""
"55049764-2-5961","Shame about Captain Helane. I hear even a touch of that poison gives you the runs for years, though. That'll keep me grinning.",""
"55049764-2-5968","The sergeant said Velyn Harbor would have fallen without you. Honor to meet you—I'm the Green Lady. The, uh, the new one.nnI could use your help. The Drublog clan usually side with my people in times of war. We need to learn what changed.",""
"55049764-2-5970","Have you spoken to my father? We must hurry, with or without his blessing.",""
"55049764-2-5971","<<1>> told me she'd wait for the right champion at the upper arena's gates.nnGo and do what you must.",""
"55049764-2-5972","I'm surprised House Dres managed to do anything with the Ordinators on high alert. Not much gets past them, even when they're not looking for trouble.",""
"55049764-2-5974","Did you get it? I'm going to need that wine if this ruse is going to work.",""
"55049764-2-5978","Impressive.",""
"55049764-2-5979","I watched you fight. Impressive.",""
"55049764-2-5980","Soon. Soon you too will know of my greatness.",""
"55049764-2-5981","Tell Daljari you bested some brawlers. Then come back here so I can knock you around.",""
"55049764-2-5982","Once again, you return safely from the dream, bringing one of Vaermina's victims back with you.nnGeneral Godrun seems to be feeling himself again.",""
"55049764-2-5983","Your technique is good but that is rarely good enough.",""
"55049764-2-5984","Bthzark is on the north side of the island. Neramo should be poking around the ruins.",""
"55049764-2-5985","Tell Daljari you're ready for a real fight.",""
"55049764-2-5986","I didn't expect to get help so quickly. Remind me to thank Kaleen when we're done here.",""
"55049764-2-5987","Where do you think I found my husband? Hiding! Hiding in a tree stump!",""
"55049764-2-5988","I'm going to stick around and see what I can salvage here. Pity about poor Raston, though.",""
"55049764-2-5990","Follow the rules. Talk to Daljari and then we can fight.",""
"55049764-2-5995","You should give the bucket to Jill.",""
"55049764-2-5996","What do you want?",""
"55049764-2-6001","Follow the road to the mine. I'll be right there.",""
"55049764-2-6007","You desecrate a few old graves, and already the Bretons are back to complain.nnNice work dealing with the cult. Warchief Tazgol will be pleased.",""
"55049764-2-6008","If the Maulborn figured out a way to reactivate these wards, they have more powerful allies than we thought. nnNow be careful and get your shapely butt moving.",""
"55049764-2-6011","My friend! As you can see, my lovely wife Liane found me. I mean, I found her! We found each other!nnPlease give me good news. Please.",""
"55049764-2-6012","Let me do the talking, won't you?",""
"55049764-2-6013","These are troubled times in Stormhaven. nnI should be focused on the Daggerfall Covenant as a whole, but it would be unwise to neglect the threats to our home lest we lose that which we fight for.",""
"55049764-2-6014","I'll have this guillotine down and burned before the day's over. You have my word.",""
"55049764-2-6026","Please … you have to help. They're trapped. There's no help coming, and they don't know it.",""
"55049764-2-6028","Get out of my house! Put on a shirt and get back to the arena, whelp!",""
"55049764-2-6029","Thank you for helping <<1>> find me.",""
"55049764-2-6032","Thank you for sparing my cousin. nnEspecially since I'm sure he doesn't deserve it. The old rascal.",""
"55049764-2-6036","I'll be sure to credit you when I present my findings to the Mages Guild. Thank you again!",""
"55049764-2-6039","Hurry! If the guards catch you, they'll have your head on a pike!",""
"55049764-2-6041","I hope you made the right choice. It is done. Other matters concern us now.",""
"55049764-2-6042","We've got a crew to rival the legends! Time to make some money, don't you agree?",""
"55049764-2-6045","I am done talking. Make the right decision!",""
"55049764-2-6046","Now, put it over your head and get out of my sight.",""
"55049764-2-6047","Well, look who's come to pay a visit!",""
"55049764-2-6048","The man is a pig. But then, aren't they all?",""
"55049764-2-6051","By the Empyrean Light. The Worm Cult brought his spirit back, didn't they? And you led him here.",""
"55049764-2-6052","I feel … free. It's as though a burden has been lifted from me, a burden I didn't know I carried.nnWhatever you did, it feels … right. When my memory returns, I'll find you and thank you properly for this.",""
"55049764-2-6054","Another day, another whipping. This job just gets better and better.",""
"55049764-2-6063","Endarwe has to know more. Talk to him again.",""
"55049764-2-6065","Shuzura knows how I feel about her. Just make sure to rub it in. Heh.",""
"55049764-2-6066","Khali … damn it. So strong, so forceful. So stupid when it comes to things like this. nnI suppose there's nothing else for it. We have to make for Dune.",""
"55049764-2-6067","You're a gift from the Stars. Once you're into the tunnels, Telenger should be easy to find. Do whatever it takes to get that old fool out of there.",""
"55049764-2-6068","Shazah … damn it. Why did she force me into this? nnI suppose there's nothing else for it. We have to make for Dune.",""
"55049764-2-6069","I should warn you, Gloo is a little … odd. But she's a damned genius when it comes to alchemy.",""
"55049764-2-6070","Good timing. We need to get some information out of our friend here. She seems pretty dense.nnI was just telling her how delicious I find silent tongues.",""
"55049764-2-6071","You're going to do great! Just, whatever you do, don't … err. nnYou know what? I forget. Probably wasn't important. Meet me at my workshop, northwest edge of the village, when you're done.",""
"55049764-2-6072","I wanted to pick up something nice for Captain Kaleen. Something to surprise her, like a new mug. But all this stuff is so expensive!",""
"55049764-2-6074","If the Countess is truly sick, I am more than a little bit concerned. nnI would not wish to remain in this village if she was not in charge.",""
"55049764-2-6078","We have sailed often to Betnikh these last years. Chief Tazgol is a gracious host. In many ways, this is my second home.",""
"55049764-2-6079","If it's true that the Countess is… well, no longer able to manage her estate… I hope it's Sir Brice who takes over.",""
"55049764-2-6083","A hive of ants is no less busy … or determined … than our captain. I am honored to serve upon this ship.",""
"55049764-2-6084","Don't let me die in here!",""
"55049764-2-6093","You journey into danger. Choose your steps carefully.",""
"55049764-2-6094","Bah, the dull claws on you. Do you have any idea how many coins you're leaving on the table?",""
"55049764-2-6095","Thank you. You have made a wise decision. The Bright Moons will sing your name for this.",""
"55049764-2-6099","Kalari will be all right, you will see. Just needs some time to deal with what has happened.nnGo, speak to Shuzura. She will want to hear from you.",""
"55049764-2-6101","You haven't finished serving everyone at the bar yet!",""
"55049764-2-6110","He came stalking back here, mad as a wet Khajiit. You'd better talk to him.",""
"55049764-2-6111","You smell like burnt corn. Is it done?",""
"55049764-2-6112","My, my. So the Arbordawn cult has been spun into Mephala's web. Fascinating. Worrying, to be sure! But fascinating.",""
"55049764-2-6113","Fivefold venerations upon you, traveler. What brings you to the Falinesti Autumn site?",""
"55049764-2-6114","Welcome to the Falinesti Autumn site. I'm with the team Telenger has brought. What brings you this way?",""
"55049764-2-6115","Welcome to the Falinesti Autumn site. Ghadar is working with the famed Artificer Telenger to study the site.",""
"55049764-2-6117","Don't worry. Tazia will not be moving. She has no interest in any kind of heroics.",""
"55049764-2-6118","That map—it marks the location of our treasures! Listen, I don't know how you got it, and I can't stop you from looking for those relics with these necromancers around, but if you find them, bring them to me.nnI'll make it worth your while.",""
"55049764-2-6120","Did you do it? Did you kill the Goblin king?",""
"55049764-2-6121","There's more to this plot than simply spreading chaos across the land. I won't rest until we uncover the truth behind this assassination attempt.",""
"55049764-2-6122","This is it! Either we break them or they break us!nnWhere is everyone? It's going to take more than just me!",""
"55049764-2-6123","Well? What did you find? Did he leave behind some papers, something to show what's going on in Shuzura's town?",""
"55049764-2-6124","I know we have just met, but you must listen to me. You must decide, do your duty. Destroy the circlet.",""
"55049764-2-6126","What are you still doing here? Shuzura will be wanting you there now, not when you feel like it.",""
"55049764-2-6127","Still waiting to hear why I need you.",""
"55049764-2-6128","You again? What's it this time?",""
"55049764-2-6130","Keep your eyes peeled. This place is crawling with surprises.",""
"55049764-2-6133","Hey there! You look like you don't have anything to do. The guy over there seems to be in dire need of help.",""
"55049764-2-6135","Why are you still here? Go away.",""
"55049764-2-6138","I honor you for bringing news of my brother's death. Now I know his fate, sad as it was.",""
"55049764-2-6140","Ha! I didn't think I'd ever find you. You move around.",""
"55049764-2-6141","What were you doing in the mine? And did you see a scummy Breton up there?",""
"55049764-2-6143","I'll take the Baron back to town with me. The magistrate will know what to do with him.",""
"55049764-2-6146","Ah! Thank Alkosh you found her! We've lost enough soldiers today without adding our best scout to their ranks. nnWith luck, the two of you will find more, yes?",""
"55049764-2-6147","What a day.",""
"55049764-2-6150","If you choose to destroy the relic, then you've turned your back on me and the Covenant. Make the right choice.",""
"55049764-2-6151","Did it go well? Do you have the samples?",""
"55049764-2-6152","Raz could not help but overhear. It is a terrible thing, to tell a person her father is gone.",""
"55049764-2-6153","He's badly hurt. I'll see if I can get him bandaged up.",""
"55049764-2-6154","Head to Moriseli, the Ayleid ruin to the north. Shaman Azlakha is already out there, and she may need help.",""
"55049764-2-6155","Chief Tazgol took the army to Carzog's Demise. Hurry if you want to actually kill any cultists.",""
"55049764-2-6156","I blacked out for a second, thought I died. Did you find the plant sap?",""
"55049764-2-6160","To think that my brother was afflicted by something similar to Sir Hughes … that's frightening indeed. nnI thank you for helping him. I still hope we're able to bring Sir Hughes to justice for what happened to my sweet Lakana.",""
"55049764-2-6163","What're you waiting for? Let's get rid of that pest!",""
"55049764-2-6164","I can't make Goblin's Delight without sugar leaf. Get it and I'll make you a treat you will never forget. Zich loves it!",""
"55049764-2-6174","You! How much more blood do you want?",""
"55049764-2-6177","Spare your blade, Orc. We have yielded to you.",""
"55049764-2-6179","Looks like you found his family. Maybe he isn't as full of Elf dung as I thought.",""
"55049764-2-6183","It's time. The people of Crosswych have taken up arms and are ready to retake their town.nnBut first, <<1>> must die.",""
"55049764-2-6186","We need this shore cleared to advance. Get these lamias off my beach!",""
"55049764-2-6187","My mistake cost my family their home and my people their lives. In my anguish, I sought to redeem myself.",""
"55049764-2-6191","I had my unit scale the sheer cliff behind us, and there was much complaining. The young are weak.nnYou, however, handled that Conduit Stone very well.",""
"55049764-2-6192","So the duchess got killed by one of those high-and-mighty knights?nnFolks like me, we liked her—and now she's gone. I hope those knights get what's coming to them.",""
"55049764-2-6197","The ritual tore the veil between Nirn and Oblivion, allowing Mannimarco to begin stealing the souls his master needed to power the Dark Anchors and initiate the Planemeld.",""
"55049764-2-6198","The holy waters of Do'Krin have kept the Claw safe for years. I pray they keep you safe as well.",""
"55049764-2-6202","Why did you invade our island? We had no quarrel with you!",""
"55049764-2-6207","The thought of the dead walking around is unsettling at best. Soon they'll be shambling into Cropsford!",""
"55049764-2-6208","As soon as I know there's nothing in here, we can go. I have a feeling though. Keep looking around.",""
"55049764-2-6209","The spirits have vanished! Their valiant souls rest once again. Quickly tell me what you found below; we have much to discuss.",""
"55049764-2-6210","I need to get these goods shipped to Daggerfall right away. So please, just leave me alone. nnNo offense, but our business is finished and I want nothing more to do with you.",""
"55049764-2-6211","Yes?",""
"55049764-2-6212","Lord Diel is a miserable piece of work. I just hope my brother knows what he's doing.",""
"55049764-2-6214","I've got no love for the Covenant, but it is good to see a few more Orc faces in town.",""
"55049764-2-6216","I think the constable did the right thing. There's something shady about that knight. I've been watching her.",""
"55049764-2-6218","Indaenir's a real piece of work, isn't he? I always thought he was half-mad. They say he has ""the Green"" in his blood, but most things that man does, I just don't understand. nnRecently though, I've realized just how fortunate we are to have him.",""
"55049764-2-6219","The incessant clamor of the undead at the gate finally stops, and you come through the gate—it is a relief to finally see someone new from among the living.nnIs Akkhuz-ri correct in thinking you have come to our aid?",""
"55049764-2-6220","Glad that's done. The pleading of the condemned is almost too much to bear. One way or another, they are returned to the Forest.",""
"55049764-2-6222","That's what the Orcs want, a fight? We could have resolved this hours ago! Though I suppose the captain's not too keen on killing our new friends.",""
"55049764-2-6223","I'm just going to assume at this point that S'rashi's giving me a break. True or not, that's what I'm going with. nnMeans I can head back to the ship …. Well, maybe just one more drink first.",""
"55049764-2-6225","Go on, the guards are always good to give a sound beating.",""
"55049764-2-6226","That was unexpected.",""

"55049764-2-6236","You made it! I wasn't sure if you would. I haven't had a drink in days, but if you've got the ingredients I need, it's time to celebrate!",""
"55049764-2-6240","Why isn't … why isn't he breathing? nnOh gods, we're too late.",""
"55049764-2-6241","The fighting sounded rather brutal from down here.  You're still in one piece though, so I'll take that as a good sign.",""
"55049764-2-6243","This guar gives its life so we may have meat. Now, I give you my time. Why?",""
"55049764-2-6246","When I leave this place, I will need all my strength. I thank you for my life.",""
"55049764-2-6247","Did you get my lute from <<1>>?",""
"55049764-2-6248","Stretch your tail here in peace.nnWhat brings you to the Hatching Pools?",""
"55049764-2-6250","Been to Crosswych, eh? We'll have the Red Rooks on the run soon enough.",""
"55049764-2-6251","What took you so long?",""
"55049764-2-6252","I'd never seen Sai's proving grounds before. It must have been a serene place before the attack.",""
"55049764-2-6253","I suspect that Vardan died when the portal closed. The body cannot survive without the soul.",""
"55049764-2-6254","You have a container, good. Are you ready for what's next?",""
"55049764-2-6255","This place is pretty impressive.",""
"55049764-2-6257","I need you to listen to me.",""
"55049764-2-6258","This thing must be destroyed!",""
"55049764-2-6261","Don't mind Marius. He was ordered here to look after the interests of the Empire. But really, all he cares for is his own advancement.",""
"55049764-2-6266","Quickly, Hallowed. Close the portal! Sealing it should draw the beasts back to Oblivion.",""
"55049764-2-6269","More wounded arrive by the hour. I hope you have good news for me.",""
"55049764-2-6270","Use the visions as guides, not shackles. Your fate is yours to determine.",""
"55049764-2-6273","Hmph. You've impressed even me. The Dominion owes you yet another debt.",""
"55049764-2-6275","Leave me alone.",""
"55049764-2-6276","You're looking for Sir Hughes, aren't you? Get in line. We've been waiting for him to come and clarify our orders for days. nnHe returned all right. But mumbling incoherently. Know what that means? Just more confusion. I think Hughes has lost it.",""
"55049764-2-6279","I wonder what's taking Jakarn so long? I wouldn't keep a girl like me waiting.",""
"55049764-2-6281","Curse Jakarn! How does he slip about so easily? I turn my back for one moment and he's gone.nnHe's probably off with those slatterns from Stros M'Kai. If I find any of them, it won't be pretty.",""
"55049764-2-6282","You have no idea how long I've waited to taste a good Orcish brew! That swill the Redguards call beer has less kick than a mudcrab.nnNow, if only Lambur would join me.",""
"55049764-2-6284","At last, I find myself looking forward to my future.",""
"55049764-2-6285","The Bright Moons smile down upon us, traveler. The Claw is safe.",""
"55049764-2-6286","You have returned! Bright Moons be praised! Do you … do you have the relics?",""
"55049764-2-6287","I respect the captain, but I won't set foot on an island full of Orcs.",""
"55049764-2-6288","Well, I'm considering waiting til we get out to sea, then throwing you over. I can barely stand the sight of you.",""
"55049764-2-6290","I lost my best daggers when the Maiden's Breath ran aground. I'm going to pick up something new, but the question is what?nnDo I need a new dagger or a trusty mace? Depends on what we're killing, I suppose.",""
"55049764-2-6291","I don't trust these Orcs. Their chief refuses to join the Covenant. No idea why.",""
"55049764-2-6292","I'm … I'm the Mane! Hallowed, we survived!",""
"55049764-2-6301","Hallowed, thank you for dispatching that treacherous Urcelmo. I … have to admit, I'm going to make jokes at his expense for years off this.",""
"55049764-2-6302","Sholg says you talked Lokra out of her wild ideas. You honor our clan. She will be an asset to her people.",""
"55049764-2-6304","Point me at what you'd like slain.",""
"55049764-2-6305","What is it? You want me to stab something?",""
"55049764-2-6306","We've been through quite a bit together, haven't we?nnIf you ever pass this way again, feel free to stop by and visit. I can think of a few other rituals that you can help me with, if you're interested.",""
"55049764-2-6317","Hunal's commentary on your progress has been … most interesting, Hallowed. I hope seeing me alive and well is not too distressing.",""
"55049764-2-6318","I'm sorry, Hallowed. The words of the Moon Bishop have affected me greatly. The thought of my people gone feral, my Silvenar dead ….",""
"55049764-2-6319","Hunal tells me you've already progressed well along the path. You continue to impress me, Hallowed.",""
"55049764-2-6320","ON the agony! The affront to our faith and our people!",""
"55049764-2-6321","They have some interesting brews here, don't you think?",""
"55049764-2-6327","The Covenant moved in when they took Drakelowe. As long as they don't make me work, we'll get along.",""
"55049764-2-6328","Too close! They nearly had us that time. The wards will keep the Daedra bound, for now, but I'm still not sure how they managed to break them. We need to investigate Ilmyris.",""
"55049764-2-6329","You have my gratitude. That is no small thing. Zadala always remembers her debts.",""
"55049764-2-6331","The Woodland Man is not wood or land or a man.",""
"55049764-2-6332","Orthenir's soul seals the binding, but without a caretaker the Daedra flee. It is temporary. The mountain is worn away and the tides rise and fall with the same inevitability.",""
"55049764-2-6335","We can get to the Imperial underground through an old guardtower. Raz thinks it's … to the southwest? Yes. Let's go!",""
"55049764-2-6336","Quick work. Word spreads that I have a new collector. I've already gotten back some of the coin I was owed.",""
"55049764-2-6337","What are you doing standing around here? You have your mission. Do not miss the meeting!",""
"55049764-2-6339","Well done. You've made quite a name for yourself among the Shadowscales. nnSoon, our services will be required elsewhere. We may need you again in the future.",""
"55049764-2-6340","Don't bother coming back here until you've run off the Orcs. I've got important business to attend to. Heh.",""
"55049764-2-6342","Hurry! Head into the tunnel and find our leader. She'll explain the plan to you.",""
"55049764-2-6351","It is time for you to go. Leave my body here, where it cannot be bothered again.nnYou have done more than I could have hoped for. Thank you.",""
"55049764-2-6352","Ahh, a traveler. Coming from Dune, sent by the Moon Bishop, if she had to guess. This one is pleased to see you.",""
"55049764-2-6353","My scales are falling out.",""
"55049764-2-6354","This way, it isn't far!",""
"55049764-2-6357","What a day.",""
"55049764-2-6360","The Stormfist thugs captured me. I'm done for!",""
"55049764-2-6362","Beginner's luck. You still need to win three duels.",""
"55049764-2-6363","If the plague of necromancy has truly returned, I fear the future may bring many dark days.nnSomeone will need to come forward to fight the risen dead.",""
"55049764-2-6364","So there you have it. My true form revealed.",""
"55049764-2-6367","Ha! You should've seen Garnikh's face when you won that duel!",""
"55049764-2-6372","Oh, no.nnCheck his body. There must be something to tell us who did this.",""
"55049764-2-6374","Good fight. Garnikh's bitten off more than he can chew this time.",""
"55049764-2-6375","So, I'm next?",""
"55049764-2-6376","Good Thane Harvald here has let me in on your recent accomplishments.nnYou certainly are disrupting Fildgor's plans here at Fort Amol.",""
"55049764-2-6378","I hope you realize what you've gotten yourself into. Once you're in Fahara'jad's inner circle, you'll never get a moment's rest. nnI know this from personal experience.",""
"55049764-2-6380","So, you convinced Lokra to remain. Good. It may not be what she wanted, but it's best for our clan.",""
"55049764-2-6381","Lokra never really had a choice. I'm glad you helped her see that.nnWithout her clan, she is lessened. And without her, so are we.",""
"55049764-2-6382","Did you manage to fill up the supply cache?",""
"55049764-2-6391","Of all the ports in Tamriel, why this one? I sailed all the way across the Iliac Bay and I need a glass of grog!nnI've shared a drink with some unsavory characters, but I draw the line at zombies. I think I'll stay off the docks for now.",""
"55049764-2-6392","We're here. In Daggerfall. Now get off my boat.",""
"55049764-2-6393","The Fangs of Sithis are the property of the Night Mother. We will return them to our enclave and protect them until they are needed.",""
"55049764-2-6394","Thanks for getting those supplies. Quite a few of us have been in need of a good patching up.",""
"55049764-2-6395","I can't believe we survived that! You made the right choice, I think. Anything else would have been disaster.",""
"55049764-2-6397","Rid-Thar will tell you what he can. But know that this choice is yours. You must choose with your heart, and your mind, and your soul.",""
"55049764-2-6408","Look for the truth behind the appearances in her memory. She is a very special young lady.",""
"55049764-2-6409","I trust you, traveler. I know you've made the right decision.",""
"55049764-2-6410","You should find enough uniforms to disguise all of the prisoners in that crate over there.",""
"55049764-2-6412","Tand thought he was going to be sold! This one thanks you for your help!",""
"55049764-2-6413","His life mate <<1>> warned him of the dangers here, but <<2>> did not listen. The son of Muzag is as stubborn as he is naive.",""
"55049764-2-6414","<<1>> attracts trouble like fleas. He'll get his claws clipped one day, I swear.",""
"55049764-2-6415","I almost lost hope! You will always be remembered by this family!",""
"55049764-2-6421","Thunderbug bellies and hive seeds make a fire guardian. Hive seeds and dew bugs make a wooden guardian. Thunderbug bellies and dew bugs, a water guardian.nnIt's up to you.",""
"55049764-2-6422","You released him—I think that was the right thing to do. nnI'm glad to know that at least some of the spirits here will be able to rest, though I am sorry for the villagers who remain trapped in the Shadow Wood.",""
"55049764-2-6423","Do not hesitate. This is the only way the Keeper oath is fulfilled and Tamriel remains safe.",""
"55049764-2-6424","Patience, my friend. The race is about to begin!",""
"55049764-2-6428","Please … help me.",""
"55049764-2-6429","Let us not dawdle in this vile place. Find me in the Hollow City and speak to me there.",""
"55049764-2-6430","Rumors say that the people of Zuuk were wiped out by a flu years ago.",""
"55049764-2-6431","All this standing around is bad for my knees.",""
"55049764-2-6436","It seems the Prince of Murder has already disrupted your plan. Where is your army? Surely not even you can hope to take on a Daedric Prince by yourself.nnYou need an army. And you need a safe haven to discuss strategy and gather your forces.",""
"55049764-2-6437","Will the Champion of <<1>> also prove to be the champion of spikeball?",""
"55049764-2-6440","Keep moving. I'm right behind you!",""
"55049764-2-6441","Let's see what he has to say.",""
"55049764-2-6442","Well, don't dally about here, you've got a princess to rescue. It was a princess, wasn't it?",""
"55049764-2-6444","Disaster looms with the Elder Scroll of Altadoon in the hands of our enemies. It must be recovered!",""
"55049764-2-6445","You see? It's clear that Asteril has been dead for some time, so she cannot have been the one you saw in the Imperial tunnels!nnI told you—say what you will about the Thalmor—but we do not have traitors in our midst.",""
"55049764-2-6446","If you haven't seen it yourself, Dominion forces are all over <<A:1>>. They kill anyone who tries to leave.nnThe only good news is they've left the eggs unharmed. We could use your help in learning why.",""
"55049764-2-6447","I guess you aren't an illusion, after all. Skordo also vouched for your existence. He doesn't vouch for anything, so you must have really impressed him.",""
"55049764-2-6448","Ezreba prays for forgiveness.",""
"55049764-2-6451","This mess with our leader needs figuring out, and fast.",""
"55049764-2-6452","My scales itch for a contract.",""
"55049764-2-6453","Damned cultists. Tried to melt our minds and left a giant mess to clean up. Damned inconsiderate.",""
"55049764-2-6455","Was that a vision of Lady Estre? Is there no end to the strange magic of this place?",""
"55049764-2-6456","Do what you must, outsider. Do what you must.",""
"55049764-2-6457","I'm trying to eavesdrop on the conversation, if you don't mind.",""
"55049764-2-6458","The fight is about to begin! May Riddle'Thar bring you luck!",""
"55049764-2-6461","I wish I'd had a chance to talk to that Dunmer before he sped off. What could he know about this?",""
"55049764-2-6462","Finished with your little chat?nnI shall relieve him of his head now and rid us of his insufferable mewling.",""
"55049764-2-6463","You must have mercy! The Dark Elf won't listen, but you will, won't you? nnWe were different! I didn't want this!",""
"55049764-2-6464","Have you solved the puzzle?",""

"55049764-2-6478","So, not overcome by poisonous fumes or fallen into lava yet?",""
"55049764-2-6480","You've done it! Tell Yzzgol what you've learned. Let's end this.",""
"55049764-2-6481","When you're prepared to travel, we leave for Rictus.",""
"55049764-2-6482","I know it will be hard for the community to accept her, but I think this is for the best. She deserves a chance to rejoin the village.",""

"55049764-2-6485","Thanks to you, my squad has safe passage to <<1>>.nn<<2>> offered to make us part of the Prowler's crew. Don't know if I'll have a choice once the fleet puts itself back to together, but it's better than sitting around and counting sand.",""
"55049764-2-6486","May Y'ffre look after <<1>>. The gods know, nothing will protect his killer once the sergeant learns their names.nnYou go warn that ship. We'll prepare our friend for what awaits us all.",""

"55049764-2-6506","That foul creature. I expect her to lead the Shadowed Path into Vlastarus any minute now!",""
"55049764-2-6509","Forgive me. You did so much to help a stranger. I won't forget.nnI can open a portal to the temple courtyard, if you wish.",""
"55049764-2-6510","Please don't think me ungracious. Without your aid, I'd still be under <<1>>'s influence. I won't forget.nnI can open a portal to the temple courtyard, if you wish.",""
"55049764-2-6511","If only the bandits would leave us alone, we might have a chance.",""
"55049764-2-6514","Sea Vipers are all over the beach, but the lookout spotted a bunch of them on that island nearby. I don't know what they're up to, but it can't be good.",""
"55049764-2-6515","Stop interrupting, Dark Elf!nnExcuse me, please. What else can Zur assist you with?",""
"55049764-2-6516","The summoner's array still remains. Destroying it should put an end to their assault on Mistral.",""
"55049764-2-6518","I could get used to traveling around with you. It's never dull, I'll give you that.",""
"55049764-2-6523","I will never forgive you for what you did. That relic is going to cause horrible suffering in the world.nnI'm leaving this ship, leaving Kaleen. Perhaps I'll go out on my own. Whatever happens, stay out of my way.",""
"55049764-2-6526","I will be blunt. You were a fool to trust a relic that powerful to these Bretons. If they do not use it for evil, they will harm themselves through their ignorance.nnI believe I am done with both you and Captain Kaleen.",""
"55049764-2-6528","When the elves attack our shores and hundreds of our soldiers die, I want you to remember the choice you made. If you had kept that relic, we could have saved those soldiers.nnYou made the wrong choice.",""
"55049764-2-6535","Your decision at Carzog's Demise will affect this world greatly, for good or for ill. Kasan fears the relic will bring more destruction than good. Even so, it was your decision.nnTravel safely.",""
"55049764-2-6540","Well, after all the years it's taken me to find this place, I certainly did not expect to see someone else down here. nnWere you searching for it as well? Or do you even realize that this is the final resting place of Sabasad the Shield?",""

"55049764-2-6548","Welcome back to the Guild Hall! How goes the search?",""
"55049764-2-6551","Watch yourself! This isn't a safe place for soldiers of the Covenant.",""
"55049764-2-6558","Seeing my comrades again gives me hope.  We'll guard the outpost while you finish this.",""

"55049764-2-6609","I suppose you're feeling pretty cocky about now. Don't let it go to your head. The qualifying rounds are child's play. nnAre you ready to take on a real challenger?",""
"55049764-2-6610","Welcome back, my lovely! Zara wondered when you would return. She missed you terribly. nnThe other contenders should thank Jone and Jode that championships are not won by physical attraction. Your sleekness would best them all.",""

"55049764-2-6624","I can feel the spirit's frustration. It wants to help the Great Tree, but something prevents it.",""
"55049764-2-6626","Thank you once again for what you did. Let's not speak of the details. Thorinor has worried enough as it is. You brought us back together, and that's all that matters to us.",""
"55049764-2-6629","You have now witnessed the first sacrifice, and you know that true honor need not be named.n nYou are now one of us. You are Ash'abah.  We will recognize you as our sister and together, we will uphold the sacred duty of our tribe.",""
"55049764-2-6630","Do not be afraid. The Wood Elves have only themselves to blame.nnWe shall never cower in the shadows again.",""
"55049764-2-6631","Oh! You startled me!",""
"55049764-2-6635","The passage to the tower is to the northwest. Go on. And good luck in there!",""
"55049764-2-6636","<<1>> cooks the filthy skooma in his lair. Let's put an end to him.",""
"55049764-2-6637","Who are you?",""
"55049764-2-6640","You'll have to go on alone. Find the Engine. Destroy it.nnSurveying these ruins will have to wait.",""
"55049764-2-6641","I want to heal the Great Tree, but I'm just a farmer. If something is keeping that spirit from mending the roots, there's nothing I could do to help.",""
"55049764-2-6647","You are one of us now. Welcome to the tribe. nnTrue honor need not be named.",""
"55049764-2-6649","Good day to you, and welcome! I hope you didn't have too much trouble with the locals on your way in. Feel free to look over my sundries. Just let me know if you find something you fancy.",""
"55049764-2-6652","Welcome back to the Guildhall. There is much knowledge buried beneath the sands of Alik'r. Have you found any to share?",""
"55049764-2-6653","Please … there is not much time. nnFirst, you must decide … are you willing to join us, to become … an Ash'abah?",""
"55049764-2-6656","What foul magic is this? This … is this the Shadow Wood? nnIt is. This is what the Shade seeks—to transform Valenwood into … this. A realm of darkness and evil. It's inconceivable!",""
"55049764-2-6657","Welcome to the Sentinel Fighters Guildhall. You look like the capable sort. Interested in signing up?",""
"55049764-2-6658","Good luck with the spinner.",""
"55049764-2-6660","Today truly is the worst of my life.nnDamned Netches.",""
"55049764-2-6661","Collect the gate key from the coffer to the north and destroy the three crystals to bring down the barrier. There's one crystal in each tower.nnMeet me near the Hall of Judgment's entrance when you're done. I'll continue scouting until then.",""
"55049764-2-6662","Let <<1>> take a look at you. Quite dry for a castaway, and no injuries this one can see.nnDid you hit your head in the shipwreck? Here, stand on one foot. That's a sure way to tell!",""
"55049764-2-6663","If the commander doesn't send someone to help our troops on the shoals, they won't need me. They'll need a gravedigger.",""
"55049764-2-6665","Help me, please! I got caught in this bubble of force, or whatever you call it. Get me out!",""
"55049764-2-6667","I found a note in one of the desks talking about this hatch back here. Guess what's down there?",""
"55049764-2-6670","Sorry, the lodge is off-limits to anyone not part of the Pact delegation. You'll have to move on.",""
"55049764-2-6672","I just need a mug.",""
"55049764-2-6674","Ah, mortal! You are a curious creature.",""
"55049764-2-6675","You've done it. The tomes are gone! I can't hear them anymore.",""
"55049764-2-6677","Who are you? You don't belong in here. Wait, maybe you can help me?nnI ran away from home with one of the bandits, but I've since learned that he was a jerk. He lost my ring in a game of dice and killed my father when he came looking for me.",""
"55049764-2-6678","Quickly. We don't have much time.",""
"55049764-2-6679","We're finally taking control of our own fates again. Long live the Fighters Guild!",""
"55049764-2-6681","Such a pity! The Mourning Stone's secrets would've brought me to the Queen's attention. Once again, <<1>>'s plans stand in my path to glory.",""
"55049764-2-6682","I can't bear to think that we left our people behind in that forsaken plane, but we did what we had to do.",""
"55049764-2-6683","Don't! Oh—I'm sorry, I wasn't expecting—I mean, I am really glad you're not a Daedra.",""
"55049764-2-6684","We need your face to become familiar so your presence won't be questioned. Come, stay by my side.",""
"55049764-2-6685","You do not have horns. This is a bright moon indeed.",""
"55049764-2-6686","This one wishes you hadn't destroyed the books, but the shrine may yet reveal its secrets.nnFirst is first! Determine how to rekindle the flame.",""
"55049764-2-6687","Carry on, soldier.",""
"55049764-2-6688","You no longer wear the husk of the Hollow. Should I bestow it onto you again?",""
"55049764-2-6689","If the inspectors see these rats, we're ruined!",""
"55049764-2-6691","Whoops! I'm sorry. I didn't see you there. I almost ran right into you. I guess I'm a little distracted. Anyhow, I hope you'll forgive me.",""
"55049764-2-6692","Oh, hey, you're the one who's volunteered to drive away the Orcs, right? Chieftess Niriel wanted me to give you these seeds.",""
"55049764-2-6695","Beg your pardon! This is a private residence. Where are my guards?",""
"55049764-2-6697","Z'en's sweet mercy! We did it! The serpent's bound again! nnFirst off, I have to say I'm sorry to the gods for ever doubting them. Second, I promise I will never say that guard duty is beneath my abilities again. Never!",""
"55049764-2-6698","Please return quickly with the tools. If I can't trade them for medicine, this one's father will die.",""
"55049764-2-6699","Want to buy a carpet? How about three? They aren't good for much else.nnYes, <<1>>, even you!",""
"55049764-2-6700","This one hopes the people may be forgiving. Akkhuz-ri can't expect a warm welcome.",""
"55049764-2-6701","Thank you! This one thought we were done for after <<1>> sentenced us to death.nnHow do we get out of the Hall of Judgment? They're not going to let us simply walk out of here.",""
"55049764-2-6702","You've got to let us out!",""
"55049764-2-6703","You've got to help us!",""
"55049764-2-6705","This one will get Kargand the help he needs.",""
"55049764-2-6706","You need to use the book now. Cast the ritual! Don't worry, I turned it to the right page. You won't be annihilating worlds or anything.",""
"55049764-2-6707","Did Marcella send you? Please! Get me out of here.",""
"55049764-2-6711","Please! You've got to help me get out of here! Those crocodiles look hungry.",""
"55049764-2-6716","Peace be upon you, wayfarer. I am relieved to see a survivor from the docks. The news we have received is grave indeed.",""
"55049764-2-6717","I shall return to the council. We have many plans to put in place—both to assist you in your cause and to prepare for our return to Valenwood.nnGood luck, outsider. And thank you.",""
"55049764-2-6728","If this place remains open, as has yet to be determined, the Clan Mother should hire you in a more legitimate capacity.",""
"55049764-2-6729","You are thrice lucky, but you will never best Ishalga!",""
"55049764-2-6733","What are ye doing here?  I told ye this is sacred ground. How did ye even get past the barrier?",""
"55049764-2-6734","All right, you've had enough time. Where's the skooma?",""
"55049764-2-6735","Thank you. S'rendarr himself would commend your actions.nnGive me the skooma so I can destroy it. I want to finish what I started.",""
"55049764-2-6736","The troops have secured the Chasm. Thanks!",""
"55049764-2-6737","Caretaker Henodras is passing the mantle to Erunor at the Fading Tree now. Hurry!",""
"55049764-2-6738","We will stay here to protect the priestess from the bandits, in case you drive any of them out.",""
"55049764-2-6739","I'm terribly worried about my comrades. Especially my brother Veranus. Mother would never forgive me if I returned to Bravil without him.",""
"55049764-2-6740","Mara bless you, child. Did one of my temple guards send you this way?",""
"55049764-2-6741","Ah, it is my most pleasant and clever friend. Zur is happy to see you again!nnThis Hollow City, it is nice, yes? Gadris would have liked this place. I learned much from our time together. Zur keeps better notes, now. Very neat. Less doodles.",""
"55049764-2-6742","It is nice to see you again, friend. I find the accommodations in this city to be most pleasing.nnI can't help but imagine that Zur would have taken great delight in this place. I think of him often.",""
"55049764-2-6743","We must be ever vigilant. Daedra can be as devious as dark clouds on a sunny day.",""
"55049764-2-6744","You've got to destroy all four of the focus crystals in order for us to open the portal.",""
"55049764-2-6745","Sorry I missed the fight with Molag Grunda. I got distracted by a veritable flood of Dremora. I was up to my ankles in Winged Twilights and was having a grand old time!",""
"55049764-2-6747","Go on in, don't keep the Captain waiting.",""
"55049764-2-6749","Go, walker. Repair and learn.",""
"55049764-2-6753","Bright moons. Jone and Jode shine down on us, even now.",""
"55049764-2-6756","We're almost done. Just destroy those totems.",""
"55049764-2-6757","Thank you, Hallowed. You've filled your role admirably, as hundreds of Moon Hallowed have done before you. You have the thanks of all who praise the Bright Moons.",""
"55049764-2-6759","Only the dead and the desperate end up in this part of the desert. You appear to be neither, so you must be a very brave soul. nnDo you intend to enter the cursed grounds, the Tears of the Dishonored?",""
"55049764-2-6761","So, we meet in person at long last. You looked taller in your projection.",""
"55049764-2-6765","I erect the spine of caution. Adalmor is not the most patient of Nords. Perhaps there are no patient Nords.",""
"55049764-2-6766","Go on—repair one of those siege weapons.",""
"55049764-2-6767","Just stick with the training, soldier.",""
"55049764-2-6770","Go ahead, use that repair kit.",""
"55049764-2-6773","The time has come to perform the ritual and destroy the Harvest Heart. My children yearn to be free!",""
"55049764-2-6775","I'm sorry. I don't have you signed up for a fight at the moment.",""
"55049764-2-6776","I'm sorry. I don't have you signed up for a fight at the moment.",""
"55049764-2-6777","I'm sorry. I don't have you signed up for a fight at the moment.",""
"55049764-2-6778","I'm sorry. I don't have you signed up for a fight at the moment.",""
"55049764-2-6780","I'm sorry. I don't have you signed up for a fight at the moment.",""
"55049764-2-6781","I'm sorry. I don't have you signed up for a fight at the moment.",""
"55049764-2-6782","I'm sorry. I don't have you signed up for a fight at the moment.",""
"55049764-2-6783","I'm sorry. I don't have you signed up for a fight at the moment.",""
"55049764-2-6784","What … what are you? Are you real?",""
"55049764-2-6787","Hm?",""
"55049764-2-6789","You heard Father, yes? We must pray at the lunar shrines to learn more of his … my past. Let's do it.",""
"55049764-2-6790","Mother said we should pray at the shrines, see more of her past. Come, Hallowed. Let's do it.",""
"55049764-2-6791","We have accomplished great things this day, my faithful friend!",""
"55049764-2-6792","I'm so glad you could come! My parents will be back tonight, and I was afraid I'd have to face them alone again.",""
"55049764-2-6793","This is my test. If I can take the life of this girl, it means that I'm willing to make the necessary sacrifices.",""
"55049764-2-6794","Gifted with a rare and powerful ability, Aranias tried in vain to win her parents' affection.",""
"55049764-2-6795","Peace be upon you, comrade. Good to see you at my little meeting.",""
"55049764-2-6796","By the Divines, it's good to see you here.",""
"55049764-2-6797","You look formidable, comrade. Perhaps one day you'd care to spar with Ra'zaym, yes?",""
"55049764-2-6798","Ahh, so nice to be holding this meeting in Skyrim. Perhaps later we can go for a run out to one of the dragonshrine ruins! Always a good fight, draugr.",""
"55049764-2-6799","You must be the one Merric and Aelif have been talking about. Finally we get some movement around here.",""
"55049764-2-6800","What news do you have?",""
"55049764-2-6801","Our customs and our traditions … these are the things that sustain us in this foul land.",""
"55049764-2-6802","I toil and sweat, but this foul land provides few bounties.",""
"55049764-2-6803","I often deal with the unknown in my role as a go-between and agreement broker.",""
"55049764-2-6804","I am most grateful for your help. Casnar's brother, Enneh, will be at his market stall. The wedding offended him so greatly, he had refused to attend.nnWhether he knows what happened to Casnar or not, let us hope we can soon put the matter to rest.",""
"55049764-2-6805","Congratulations. The path is over. The moons shine their light upon you once again.",""
"55049764-2-6806","None have entered the vault save you and the vicereeve. I have confirmed it.",""
"55049764-2-6807","You again?  You seem to make a habit of showing up just when things are getting properly twisted.",""
"55049764-2-6808","This one will never complain about a job again.",""
"55049764-2-6810","We were lucky to make it back here alive. Those Dawnmead are … they're monsters. Thank you for getting the relics back here.",""
"55049764-2-6811","Somebody here must know why <<1>> has gone bad. Ask around. Discreetly.",""
"55049764-2-6813","Be mindful of your step. This forest has been most unkind to guests.",""
"55049764-2-6814","I really appreciate you helping me out with this wolf situation.",""
"55049764-2-6815","I can't believe they're dead. Glad … glad you could bring the relics back, traveler. Make their sacrifice worth something.",""
"55049764-2-6816","The pillars seal the gateway. Unlock them with the keys.",""
"55049764-2-6817","Use the keys on the pillars and we'll be on our way to Moonhenge. Well, this Moonhenge. Confusing, isn't it?",""
"55049764-2-6818","Those bastards killed Patraud, for little more than stepping into the clearing. I'll be sure to return the favor to these Bosmer savages.",""
"55049764-2-6819","When inspecting all the claws of this plan, this one is not so sure it will work.",""
"55049764-2-6820","We'll find out what we need to know.",""
"55049764-2-6821","I'd be lying if I said I liked Patraud much. The Apprentice never knew when to shut his mouth, but he didn't deserve to die like that.",""
"55049764-2-6822","That Bosmer we … captured mentioned a matriarch named Selene.",""
"55049764-2-6824","By the Egg, those Bosmer were vicious. I won't forget Patraud's sacrifice.nnLet's hope there's research worth doing in this forest.",""
"55049764-2-6826","Told you I'd make it back, didn't I? Not going to let something like a little gutwound stop me. No way.",""
"55049764-2-6827","Honor and praise, my friend. Do you have the Staff of Magnus?",""
"55049764-2-6828","I'm sorry. Only Forebears are allowed in today. We do welcome guests on some occasions, so I hope you will return at another time.",""
"55049764-2-6829","I know you are a guest in our city, wayfarer, so I will forgive your ignorance, but the fellowship hall is open to Crowns only.",""
"55049764-2-6830","Do not worry, I will not get in your way. I like keeping I's head on I's neck.",""
"55049764-2-6831","Accompany Evoker Ahainar-jo. He will attempt to contact the Bosmer again. Perhaps they will tell us how to contact the spirit of this forest.",""
"55049764-2-6832","Greetings, Crown. nnBy Stendarr's grace we have summoned the strength to forgive you for your trespasses.  I hope you will afford us the same courtesy.",""
"55049764-2-6833","Don't you have your own dead to tend to in the Crown quarter? nnLeave us to our grief and we shall do the same for you.",""
"55049764-2-6834","You have our condolences, Forebear. We have asked Tu'whacca to take up your dead. No Redguard should face such defilement.",""
"55049764-2-6835","Thank you. You have no idea what it means for me to see Lorwen alive. And our project fulfilled. You've saved us.",""
"55049764-2-6836","May Ruptga's blessings fall upon the wayfarer who uncovered the truth about our inglorious Magistrate. Crown justice prevails once again.",""
"55049764-2-6837","Greetings, sera. Distrust runs deep here in the Alik'r, but you are most welcome in our Guildhall.",""
"55049764-2-6839","<The imperial is still dead. He will likely continue to be dead for several years.>",""
"55049764-2-6842","We must stop them from destroying my island.",""
"55049764-2-6843","I thank you. If you are braving the cellars further, I would ask again for your help. On behalf of all my people.",""
"55049764-2-6847","What foulness is afoot now? The dead have risen? I thought Alasan was purposefully not raising them!nnWere we too late? Has Alasan made himself into a lich?",""
"55049764-2-6854","I really miss my lute, F'lah.",""
"55049764-2-6858","Hunal has been giving us a running commentary of how it's going in there. Truly, your vision showed me falling to Urcelmo's blade? Raz thinks Jone and Jode do not know him very well.",""
"55049764-2-6860","I can't work under these conditions! I'm not built for war!",""
"55049764-2-6870","Remember, the beacon at the lighthouse will be our signal to move in. Light it once you've completed your task. We will descend upon the Maormer at that moment and crush them.",""
"55049764-2-6873","Leave me alone. Let me die here.",""
"55049764-2-6876","Thanks to you, my soul is back where it belongs.",""
"55049764-2-6877","Freedom is a wonderful thing. And I'm sure that dear Lady Laurent has missed me terribly. She really is lost when I'm not around to help her.",""
"55049764-2-6885","You work quickly and efficiently, young one. I appreciate that. nnDid you recover all the ship designs?",""
"55049764-2-6887","I prayed Tu'whacca would guide you.nnDid you find Zariya? I heard fighting amongst the dead … is she all right?",""
"55049764-2-6890","Don't tell anyone, but I've started sleeping under the desk. The streets are too dangerous at night.",""
"55049764-2-6892","I've a great deal of work to do, so please excuse me. nnI need keep busy. Keeps my mind off things.",""
"55049764-2-6894","Greetings, wayfarer. I'd ask you to report any rumors you might hear concerning disappearances to Justice Istah.",""
"55049764-2-6895","These disappearances have the Justice on blade's edge. Seek him out if you have any information to impart.",""
"55049764-2-6898","Hers is a sad story.",""
"55049764-2-6900","Ruptga's blessings upon you and your house, wayfarer. nnI apologize for the poor state of our streets. The recent unpleasantness in the wastes has brought an influx of Forebears from the west—and you know how they are.",""
"55049764-2-6901","Fahara'jad's appointee is useless as a sundial in a sand storm. nnIf this is the best our Forebear king can send, he should abdicate.",""
"55049764-2-6902","You must be the person who rescued all these people. We were part of Vanus Galerion's group before … well, before everything fell apart.nnWe appreciate everything you've done for us.",""
"55049764-2-6903","Got me new bones yet?",""
"55049764-2-6904","My mother banished me to this Crown-infested hamlet with its absurd bumpkin nobility to ""cool my blood."" nnIt leads me to wonder if she already knew people were being kidnapped here.",""
"55049764-2-6906","I've not seen my son for some time. At first I thought he'd debauched himself into another stupor, but now … now I bear a father's worry.",""
"55049764-2-6910","You missed all the fun.",""
"55049764-2-6911","You have to get out of here before my babies find you. They'll tear you apart! This has never happened to me before. So many people are dead!",""
"55049764-2-6913","This hall is full of secrets. If you will hear advice, then hearken—leave Bergama now before you are caught in the jackal's snare.",""
"55049764-2-6915","If rumor is to be believed, a great many of the disappearances occurred near the gambling hall. I've been giving it a wide berth.",""
"55049764-2-6918","Hmm. You looking for a skull thumping? Keep walking, stranger.",""
"55049764-2-6919","You have returned. Did you ignore the instructions of the Champions as well? Raz hears that is something you do.",""
"55049764-2-6920","Let these petty man-thieves come for me. By Tava's red feathers, we will see this nonsense ended with a flick of my blade.",""

"55049764-2-6923","My friend! It's good to see you again. I'm thrilled I could persuade Urcelmo to trek out here. We need to support Akkhuz-ri and the Champions. This is a vulnerable moment for our fragile new Dominion.",""

"55049764-2-6926","Hallowed. I hope you and these Champions won't take long. I worry about Her Majesty's security this far from Auridon.",""

"55049764-2-6928","My friend! Isn't this amazing? It's my first time on the borderlands of Valenwood. And my first time in a Khajiiti temple! I'm honored to be here today.",""
"55049764-2-6929","It's a shame about all these people going missing, but I tell you, it's great for business. Samhudah's paying me to stand here and make sure no one shady gets in. That's it. nnEasiest money I've ever made.",""
"55049764-2-6931","I've never seen a place like this in all my dreams.Unless we're in my dreams now. That's the only way it would make sense.",""
"55049764-2-6932","I hope to save enough gold to make the journey to Sentinel, but it's hard to come by in this stingy Crown village. They cling to their wealth like a goat kid to its nanny's teat.",""
"55049764-2-6933","I have something for you to do.",""
"55049764-2-6937","Ah, well met! Very well met, indeed! Allow me to welcome you to The Winking Jackal! If you should need anything, feel free to call out. nnOr, you know, throw something. That seems customary here.",""
"55049764-2-6939","The decision is yours alone, though you know what I believe is the best course to take.",""
"55049764-2-6945","Business has slowed to a tortoise's crawl since the disappearances started. nnMany of the missing were patrons of ours … friends, even. If you ask my opinion, this smells like Crown mischief.",""
"55049764-2-6946","Fair winds. Have you come to escape the sour looks as well?nnAs soon as people began to disappear, the guards went looking for the foreigners. I've taken refuge here to avoid harrassment. It's not all bad though—I'm a fair hand at dice.",""
"55049764-2-6948","Deliver the mixture quickly. If the vampirism progresses too far, curing it becomes a far more difficult endeavor.",""
"55049764-2-6949","We'll both be happier with that altar smashed. You'll see!",""
"55049764-2-6952","All stories go on, even when your part is complete. There was a reckoning for Aranias and for the Wilderking himself, as you well know.nnNow, go where your story takes you. I will try not to interrupt it again.",""
"55049764-2-6953","Now remove the heart and there may be a chance we can grow a new one.",""
"55049764-2-6954","My friend! They hit me over the head and dragged me in here. Is Alanya safe?",""
"55049764-2-6955","If Andur kills me before I pass the mantle to Aranias, there will be no caretaker of the Valenwood. nnThe forest would become a voracious monster. It would turn against the Bosmer and ultimately bring about its own destruction. You must stop him.",""
"55049764-2-6957","The bundle of roots will pull you into the ground and let you pass under the fire.",""
"55049764-2-6958","Stick close to me, and I'll have that gate open in no time.",""
"55049764-2-6967","If you don't mind, I still have recruits to drill.",""
"55049764-2-6968","Please, go let Pircalmo know what's happened. I'll untie Alanya. We've made such a mistake.",""
"55049764-2-6969","You don't look like one of Gudarz's bruisers. What do you need?",""
"55049764-2-6971","Ranneth untied me? That means Pircalmo is safe, right? He did nothing wrong?",""
"55049764-2-6972","Take out <<1>> and his lackeys will take to the hills. Spineless bastards.",""
"55049764-2-6973","Pardon me, I have to go on sentry duty.nn…Which is a relief, with all these new low-lifes in camp.",""
"55049764-2-6974","A woman named Aranias endangers the whole of the Court of the Wilderking, you must stop her.",""
"55049764-2-6975","I have guarded this square long and long, wayfarer. Even so, I do not know what the Forebears might do about these disappearances. Best that a Crown abide here and keep watch.",""
"55049764-2-6977","Welcome to the Manor of Revelry. Let me know if you see anything you like.",""
"55049764-2-6978","Help me clear a path so we can get <<1>> out of here safely.",""
"55049764-2-6979","Look at you! Nothing but skin and bones! We really need to fatten you up before you wither away to nothing.",""
"55049764-2-6980","The manor is everything you hoped for, isn't it? But look at you! You could really use a bath.",""
"55049764-2-6981","<<1>> is kind of clumsy. He tripped and stumbled six times on the way down here. It's a wonder we weren't spotted.",""
"55049764-2-6982","I don't think I like you. And I don't think my friends will like you, either. nnBetter think about moving on.",""
"55049764-2-6985","I'm a Nord—which means I'm moody, and prone to violence. Don't provoke me.",""
"55049764-2-6993","You must decide which companion to take on the initial assault. You need to travel light and move quickly, for speed is essential.nnEach of these soldiers has worked with you before. You know what each of them can do and who will serve you best.",""
"55049764-2-6994","Once you select the companion that will aid you in the initial offensive, let me know.nnAs soon as you're ready, we'll begin our assault.",""
"55049764-2-7004","The Fighters Guild came to Coldharbour for this express purpose—to stop the Planemeld and save our world. nnNo matter how many of us fall this day, we shall not fail!",""
"55049764-2-7005","Go on, close that portal. The honor's all yours.nnI'll make sure nothing sneaks up on us in the meantime.",""
"55049764-2-7006","Win or lose, it's been an honor to fight alongside you.nnThat said, let's do our best to win this thing, all right? I'm not sincere very often, and I'd hate to have wasted it just before I die in battle.",""
"55049764-2-7009","The Champions are in good hands with you, Hallowed. Good luck on your path.",""
"55049764-2-7012","The expression upon your face tells me that the time has come. The final assault is about to begin, isn't it?",""
"55049764-2-7013","The final adventure begins, yes? May the many Moons bless this foolhardy endeavor!",""
"55049764-2-7014","I enjoy a challenge as well as the next mage, but this might be a little much, even for me.nnStill, I'll do whatever I can to make sure our world isn't completely destroyed. While I grew up on the Shivering Isles, I now call Nirn my home.",""
"55049764-2-7015","Please, you have to hold on. We … we can't lose any more of our companions. There's been too many deaths already.",""
"55049764-2-7016","When I left the forest, I thought I was going to be alone in a new world. But everyone here … it feels like I'm with family again.nnYou're all stuck with me now. I'm not leaving until we finish this.",""
"55049764-2-7017","No longer will we hide in the darkness. No longer will we fear those who would hunt us.nnToday, we become the hunters.",""
"55049764-2-7026","So now we just need to find the other two wards. My apprentice Shiri is traveling with Prince Azah, trying to find answers, but they need my research.nnLet me work. I will ensure you are notified when we know more.",""
"55049764-2-7027","Hurry! If you take too long, these bandits will kill me.",""
"55049764-2-7028","You! There you are! The scholar Zohreh said I might find you here. nnYou must make great haste. Prince Azah is in need of your assistance.",""
"55049764-2-7029","Looking for something? A set of keys, perhaps?",""
"55049764-2-7030","You did it! The portal is ours now!nn<<1>> and <<2>> have already led troops through to the other side.",""
"55049764-2-7033","Here in Willowgrove, we pride ourselves on two things—our honey-mead and not being stung by bees.",""
"55049764-2-7034","You look like you're at loose ends. Interested in making some money?",""
"55049764-2-7035","I can't believe you beat me. You! A cheat and a swindler, in league with that false matchmaker!",""
"55049764-2-7036","Sorry, I'm a bit busy right now. Have you had a chance to try our honeymead?",""
"55049764-2-7038","If you're not going to deliver those to Zan, I'll give them to someone else.",""
"55049764-2-7039","<action sequence>",""

"55049764-2-7044","My men are itching to soak the sand with Imperial blood. We're just waiting on you.",""
"55049764-2-7045","I hear Zara will be picking fighters for the next division round soon. Maybe I should go flirt with her.",""
"55049764-2-7046","My scouts reported sounds of battle along the beaches. This forces my hand. If I can't explain this immediately, my superiors will hear about this and assume the worst.nnI need you to tell me what's going on in <<c:1>>.",""
"55049764-2-7047","Be on your guard wayfarer. There are more dangerous things in Bergama than discontented Redguards.",""
"55049764-2-7051","The Withered Hand rallies more dead to its banner with each passing day, and still these fools feud. Crowns and Forebears taste the same to vultures.",""
"55049764-2-7055","Tava's red feathers! Do I dare to believe my eyes? I have been watching that door for so many days … I had ceased to hope.nnTell me—did the king send his army? These Imperials could launch a full invasion if they are not stopped.",""
"55049764-2-7056","Whoever you are, I rejoice that you have come to my rescue. The Imperials have kept me locked in here.nnI deemed it likely that they would seize control of all Alik'r, and there would be nowhere to flee to.",""
"55049764-2-7057","This Khajiit's magic has no equal. Save your dignity and quit now. This one will be Sorcerer Division Champion.",""
"55049764-2-7058","You've seen for yourself. <<1>>'s influence is gone from this tribe.",""
"55049764-2-7059","Welcome. What brings you to <<c:1>>?",""
"55049764-2-7060","I've seen better.nnGo on then, ask what you will.",""
"55049764-2-7061","Do not tell Meridia, but Mezha-dro should have joined Fighters Guild. At least then fighting all these Dremora would pay something.",""
"55049764-2-7066","My axe and pack are outside. Take them with my gratitude. I must do this alone.",""
"55049764-2-7068","The harpies are congregated around this building. Looks like the mercenaries took something every bit as valuable as the harpies' eggs.",""
"55049764-2-7069","By Jone and Jode, I wasn't sure we'd make it out of that one, but you never cease to impress. Things are always exciting when you're around, it seems.",""
"55049764-2-7070","Let's go. My axe won't find a Sea Viper spine on its own.",""
"55049764-2-7071","Lead the way. We'll learn what the Sea Vipers plan soon enough.",""
"55049764-2-7072","We need to search the area for any information we can gather about the maormer's ritual. I'd start by looking in some of those ruined houses and examining a bodies lying around on the broken docks.nnMaybe a few survivors can answer questions, too.",""
"55049764-2-7075","We did it. I can't believe I'm here. My master, Rurelion, would be proud of me, I'm sure of it. nnCome on, it's time to kill Molag Grunda. We can do this!",""
"55049764-2-7081","Tu'whacca has taken the Chief. So passes Marimah—water into sand.  May the Divines bless his passage.",""
"55049764-2-7082","It wasn't easy, but we did it. We stopped the blight from spreading, defeated Naemon's servant, and we still have the heart we can use to grow a replacement for the Eldest.nnAll things considered, this went as well as I could have hoped.",""
"55049764-2-7084","If only I could get to my feet, draw my weapons …. nnBy Onsi's bright blade, I would die in combat—not like this.",""
"55049764-2-7088","Tu'whacca, I cannot heed your summons—not yet. Just a few days more and I will cleave that Withered Hand in two.",""
"55049764-2-7089","This poison strikes like a scorpion … just below the ribs.",""
"55049764-2-7090","Slain by a cup of water … Onsi, forgive me.",""
"55049764-2-7091","Many here are beyond our help. All we can do is ease their passing. Water into sand, wayfarer … water into sand.",""
"55049764-2-7092","Zeht's tears. Our dead, our sacred water—we've nothing left to revere that hasn't been polluted by these Withered Hand dogs.",""
"55049764-2-7093","Our tribe is beset by sickness. Is this the end of the Ash'abah?",""
"55049764-2-7094","I feel like I can see forever here. Not seeing what I want to though.",""
"55049764-2-7095","I beg your pardon, O wayfarer, but I must hold to my work. Many and many of my tribe-folk require attention.",""
"55049764-2-7096","The Chasm is ours. We'll protect the portal while you push on ahead.",""
"55049764-2-7097","Killing Dremora is thirsty work. I need a mead!",""
"55049764-2-7098","I think … I think I just narrowly missed Tu'whacca's summons, brother. I credit my mother. She had a stomach like an iron kettle.",""
"55049764-2-7099","Tava curse these twisted legs! I almost reached him in time. nnI wasn't fast enough.",""
"55049764-2-7100","If my brother is taken from me, by Onsi's bright blade, I will visit a blood-storm upon the Withered Hand such as the world has never seen.",""

"55049764-2-7108","And so, the little mortal, once more into the breach!nnI believe the Ayleid King wants you to find a hidden key. Hurry! I think your friends have already made it into the sealed hall.",""
"55049764-2-7109","Well, so far the vampires have remained true to their word. They allowed us to pass through the Orchard without any resistence.nnI wonder how long our good fortune will last?",""
"55049764-2-7110","With your help, we will launch a two-pronged attack into the citadel. It starts with the abandoned Fighters Guild hall within the city.nnWhile the fighters use the secret tunnel to reach the hall, you need to find the key to deactivate the wards.",""
"55049764-2-7111","What are you doing, sneaking up on a woman in my condition?",""
"55049764-2-7112","Hey, I know you. Indaenir mentioned you. You've come along at just the right time—or I guess it's the wrong time. The forest that way is blighted. Indaenir's looking into it. I'm not supposed to let anyone through, but I can make an exception.",""
"55049764-2-7113","Ah, my friend! So good to see you again! Now that my head has cleared, the writing has been going very well. How went the relic hunting?",""
"55049764-2-7114","I'm hoping to compete in the Summoner Division. I finally learned to conjure wolves. Only took me three months of training—and three lost fingers.",""
"55049764-2-7115","Don't worry about my safety. I'll be perfectly fine.",""
"55049764-2-7116","I would like to speak with you, but I must finish reading this first.",""
"55049764-2-7117","Everything is so … very different. It's like I'm no longer a single physical form, but my being is spread out across the forest.nnAranias is slipping away. You are my friend though, whoever I become. Will you stay for just a moment?",""
"55049764-2-7118","Wonderful! Thought I'd be yapping here for eternity. Blasted Wormies only have eyes for the empty ones.nnVery well, tie me to your belt and we can get started. No time to lose!",""
"55049764-2-7119","You'll find Ugorz in the Orc stronghold to the east, and Zirani in the Khajiit village in the west. Both were once-flourishing townships—but no longer. They'll need help to escape.nnI'll meet you all at the Overseer's overlook.",""
"55049764-2-7120","Nice! That'll show 'em!",""
"55049764-2-7122","Please, go away! If the Taskmaster knows we've talked, he'll be furious.",""
"55049764-2-7123","I can't tell if you're crazy or daft, but you have my thanks.nnIf you can stop the Daedra at the other fronts, we should be able to hold here. I won't blame you if you fail or flee—we're prepared to defend our homes either way.",""
"55049764-2-7125","This one knows you mean well even as you keep pestering her. You must, to risk your life to come here.nnBut she has already told you. This one refuses to leave. Taskmaster is watching.",""
"55049764-2-7126","I'll wait right here, and hope no one notices their things are missing. You do this, and you can just take the damned thing.",""
"55049764-2-7127","You-you are here? Thank the gods! We need you!nnThe third Ansei Ward is here. That girl Shiri—the scholar's apprentice—she is a necromancer and she has come to the necropolis. We have to stop her!",""
"55049764-2-7130","Do not linger here.nnThe living who wander in my realm tend to become … lost.",""
"55049764-2-7132","Welcome, stranger. I'm on the hunt, but you're not my quarry.",""
"55049764-2-7137","With Vanus and the Mages Guild to aid you, you've gained a strong advantage in this fight.nnDo not underestimate the power of Vanus Galerion. He's accomplished many great things during his lifetime.",""
"55049764-2-7139","Have you spoken to Malesse?",""
"55049764-2-7140","You didn't hear anything, got it? Certainly not that I'd like to be his night blossom. Or anyone's! Especially not his! You didn't hear that!",""
"55049764-2-7141","My apologies, but I can't chat. Tholbor's given me an arm's length of tasks to do, including his filthy laundry. Horrible man, honestly.",""
"55049764-2-7142","My apologies. I'm all out of sorts. Malarel has a thousand tasks for me, and her idea of motivation is a lightning bolt to the forehead. I understand I'm the third assistant she's had in a month!",""
"55049764-2-7143","I'm the stage manager for the Swordmaster Division. If you hurry, you can make the next round of qualifiers. Credentials, please?",""
"55049764-2-7144","A moment.",""
"55049764-2-7145","Excuse me.",""
"55049764-2-7146","Raz wishes he could help. Naemon would not last long.",""
"55049764-2-7147","A moment. I want to watch this.",""
"55049764-2-7148","Pardon. This seems an important moment.",""
"55049764-2-7149","In a moment. Shazah would like to see this.",""
"55049764-2-7150","In a moment.",""
"55049764-2-7151","Sorry. I'd like to see this.",""
"55049764-2-7154","Not only did I witness the choosing of the Silvenar, I also got to see the Heart of Valenwood. It's really been quite an extraordinary day.",""
"55049764-2-7156","Don't interrupt.",""
"55049764-2-7157","This looks important.",""
"55049764-2-7158","We've been away from the central barrier long enough. Gilraen and the others will need my healing. Let's hope they're not dead.",""
"55049764-2-7159","By the Green Pact those Daedra were powerful! nnI fear what Gilraen and the others are facing at the central barrier. Perhaps we should return to help.",""
"55049764-2-7160","Honor and Faith are due all, but you who have come from afar … your contribution is matched in measure only by the length of your journey.nnThank you.",""
"55049764-2-7161","We have to keep the Sea Vipers out of <<1>>. We must hurry.",""
"55049764-2-7173","If not for your little challenge gambit I'd have killed you by now. Get on with the fight before I change my mind.",""
"55049764-2-7179","My sword-arm hangs loose in the socket like a sagging palm frond. If you have come here to train, I suggest you find a lighter sword.",""
"55049764-2-7194","I thought we were safe here. Hidden from the enemy. The God of Schemes grows more powerful by the day!",""
"55049764-2-7198","I'll just stay here for a while longer. I should whisper a prayer to Y'ffre for my fallen brothers. nnThank you once again.",""
"55049764-2-7202","You're a strong one, aren't you? Khuzi likes the strong ones.",""
"55049764-2-7208","You got Ansei Maja's Ward? Wonderful! Why don't you hold onto it this time …?nnYou need to get the other Ward too, the one Throne Keeper Farvad was carrying. Go on! I'll find you later.",""
"55049764-2-7211","What have I done? What have I done? I have struck down one of our ancestors!nnI have betrayed my vows, my people, my god. Tu'whacca! How could you allow me to do this?",""
"55049764-2-7212","You can talk to them. The fine people inside, where the skies can't be seen. Go on, they're near.nnThey're all near. Above. Below. Who'll protect us from them?",""
"55049764-2-7214","We'll hold them off! Close the rifts! Go!",""
"55049764-2-7215","I've never seen anyone fight like that.nnI mean, you should go.",""
"55049764-2-7216","Anyone could defeat you, with enough training.",""
"55049764-2-7217","Luck is not victory. Watch your back.",""
"55049764-2-7218","Winning one battle doesn't make you a true warrior.",""
"55049764-2-7219","I'm relieved to be out of the Tower of Lies, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to be out of this damned place altogether.",""
"55049764-2-7220","We're far from the familiar sights of Stonefalls. But these perils we face—they're epic! They will sing songs of our glory long after we're gone.",""

"55049764-2-7225","I stepped out for a moment, dispatched a dozen Dremora, then popped back in. Just wanted to make sure I had the opportunity to see you off.nnWell, off with you, then! So long! Toodle-oo! Don't forget to write! Ta-ta! Cheerio!",""
"55049764-2-7227","Have you found <<1>>? They can't have taken her far from here!",""

"55049764-2-7234","I'm safe. I'm safe. They can't hurt me here.",""
"55049764-2-7235","Go to the circle. I will draw Gorzesh out of his lair and lead him to you.",""
"55049764-2-7239","Good, I can't imagine the source of what's going on over there. Plus Girin went to scout the area. Don't let him flirt with you too much. He's more interested in his own … interests sometimes then the problem at hand.",""

"55049764-2-7551","Amazing. The person in the village most in tune with the Green Pact somehow violated it.nnLike that never happens.",""

"55049764-2-7603","Divines be praised, you came back. Can we get going, please?",""
"55049764-2-7605","I didn't think anything short of my death would sate Gargak's bloodlust. We may still end up at each other's throats one day, but for the time being we can enjoy a little peace. We owe you much.",""
"55049764-2-7607","You obviously aren't a frightened refugee. Welcome to Camp Tamrith, a little slice of home in a hostile wilderness. It isn't much, but it's better than nothing.",""
"55049764-2-7609","I hate this, but there's no other way. By the Light, my sister must die with honor before the evil completely overwhelms her.nnOh, Arkay, grant me the strength to do what must be done.",""
"55049764-2-7611","<<1>> is currently off-limits. You'll need to keep back, for your own safety.",""
"55049764-2-7612","Last I saw <<1>>, she was taking shelter in one of the tents.nnI could do without this damnable rain. It's been storming since we arrived, and it shows no sign of letting up.",""
"55049764-2-7613","I can't bear the sight of him.",""
"55049764-2-7615","Wait. Did you hear that? It's the sound of you not killing each other! It is the most boring of sounds. Beyond mudcrabs mating underwater. More of a ""clump … clack … clump … clump.""",""
"55049764-2-7619","What a terrible shame, losing <<1>>. Even if she was kind of mean to me. At least Reezal-Jul won't be stirring up any more trouble.nnNow all we have to do is take care of Lleraya and Montclair.",""
"55049764-2-7621","It is done. The Amulet of Kings is ours once again.",""
"55049764-2-7622","The time has come for us to enter the catacombs of Sancre Tor. Do not underestimate the dangers that await us. nnIn ages past, Sancre Tor was a place of light, but I fear that is no longer the case. We must be prepared for anything.",""
"55049764-2-7623","I know we don't stand a chance against Molag Bal unless we recover the Amulet of Kings, but I'm still uneasy about this. That damned thing has been nothing but trouble from the beginning.",""
"55049764-2-7624","I'm not one to hope any creature suffers, but with <<1>> I'll make an exception. She can spend eternity in <<Az:2>>, for all I care.",""
"55049764-2-7625","Sebazi hopes to hear you've killed your quota of Gray Vipers.",""
"55049764-2-7626","Rumors swirl that the Gray Vipers have suffered losses of late. May we thank you for this?",""
"55049764-2-7627","Back again, eh? Now, which contract did I give you?",""
"55049764-2-7628","We must find Sai Sahan. Everything depends on that.",""
"55049764-2-7629","My estates, my titles, my own life—it's all forfeit now. All in the name of preserving the Empire.nnI swear by all the gods, Mannimarco will pay dearly for this.",""
"55049764-2-7630","I thought you had left me! Please don't do that again!",""
"55049764-2-7632","Lyris is safe, and whole once more. You have done well, but there is still much to do.",""
"55049764-2-7634","My brother's wife can't take much more of this. And truth be told, neither can I.",""
"55049764-2-7635","This place stinks of dust and death. Let's finish this and get out of here.",""
"55049764-2-7636","Do you really think this is a good time to stop and chat? The Redguard needs your help.",""
"55049764-2-7638","Sorion is very much aware of the depths of his talent. That can rub some people the wrong way. I do hope he hasn't landed in trouble he can neither sing nor play his way out of.",""
"55049764-2-7639","Beware, these roads aren't safe.",""
"55049764-2-7640","Careful there, traveler! These roads aren't safe. Bandits about.",""
"55049764-2-7642","What's wrong? You look like you've seen a wraith. nnTharn's been gone for hours. I think he's up to something.",""
"55049764-2-7644","An unexpected visit! What brings you back, Vestige?",""
"55049764-2-7646","Welcome to the chasm my friend. We're nearly there.",""
"55049764-2-7648","I hear you helped rid us of that bastard, <<1>>. You have my gratitude, friend.",""
"55049764-2-7649","So, <<1>> is dead, eh? Well, that's a bit of good news, I suppose.",""
"55049764-2-7650","Hmmph! I can't believe the king's being so over-cautious. I asked to borrow one of the Ansei Wards for a few days to study it, and he flatly refused! nnI'm still glad you got them back, of course … we make a pretty good team, I think.",""
"55049764-2-7651","Please excuse me. The stablemaster already rebuked me for negecting my duties once. I would not wish him to do so again.",""
"55049764-2-7654","Etienne … I'm sorry I failed you.",""
"55049764-2-7655","Where is Etienne? He should be back by now. Where could he be?",""
"55049764-2-7656","I'm nearly out of supplies, treating all these wounded guards. nnIf you have something to ask, be quick about it.",""
"55049764-2-7657","Stay back - I don't want to be coughing blood on you.nnThis whole mess … It could've been avoided, somehow. We weren't ready. We couldn't have been.",""
"55049764-2-7658","Let me know if you see movement, friend. I've gathered the other archers' arrows … it's just a matter of putting them in the witchmen.",""
"55049764-2-7659","Let them come! We're as ready for them now as we ever will be.nnI have all of Malacath's strength behind my axes - none of these toothless savages will topple me, now or ever!",""
"55049764-2-7660","I've killed a fair few of them today, but they just keep coming.nnFine by me. My arms aren't tired yet.",""
"55049764-2-7661","That's my home. Over there, the one on fire.",""
"55049764-2-7662","How could this have happened? This is our home! Evermore is just across the lake, and this is all we get?",""
"55049764-2-7677","Imagine, all these crates lying around and no guards in site. It's a real shame.",""
"55049764-2-7678","Don't worry. I'll make sure no dead men make off with this unattended cargo.",""
"55049764-2-7686","Shoo! Away with you! Stay out of my garden!",""
"55049764-2-7690","I hope you've not come looking for the queen. She's left all matters of state to Duke Renchant. I heard Her Majesty's tending to the indigent masses at the chapel.",""
"55049764-2-7692","She brought the book here. I followed, but it's a witches' coven—dozens of them—trying to use the book for some evil ritual. nnI'm just a novice. I should return to the guildhall in Hallin's Stand. If I'm not here when you return, meet me there.",""
"55049764-2-7694","Brave meeting. Mind your tongue in this place. Too many ears and not enough brains.",""
"55049764-2-7697","Forgive me for stating the obvious, but you're alive!nnWe heard some terrible noises in the caves below. What happened?",""
"55049764-2-7699","Amazing powers, you say? Well, I can't wait to test your theory and see what happens!",""
"55049764-2-7700","The ritual is prepared. Wyress Rashan assured me that you'd have the heart.nnAssuming you do, tell Rashan, and we can get on with it. We don't want the forest to suffer a moment longer than it has to.",""
"55049764-2-7701","Well … I expect you won't be returning any time soon to enjoy my sisters' hospitality, and I can guarantee we won't run into each other on some city street ….nnSo I guess this is goodbye then.",""
"55049764-2-7702","Good luck in locating <<1>>. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.",""
"55049764-2-7704","Such a shame about King Eamond and his son. Both of them were so dashing. Renchant is a very poor substitute.",""
"55049764-2-7707","I tell you, things grow darker here by the damn hour! nnReachmen are right down there! Came in by boat, took the lighthouse, and now they're crawling up in the woods to assess our defenses. And our orders are to just sit here and watch!",""
"55049764-2-7712","Must be nice to be able to travel between this realm and the physical realm. I'm stuck here. Yes. I'm stuck here.",""
"55049764-2-7715","Welcome back to the guildhall, my friend. nnThe history of Bangkorai is rich in lurid and bloody events. Have you brought us any regional books or journals?",""
"55049764-2-7716","Aha! I thought we were in for a bit of easy coin with this job until the queen said you were coming along. Now I know to expect danger.nnBring it on though. If the plan goes awry, that just means we get extra hazard pay.",""
"55049764-2-7717","Surprised to see me? Sounds like I already missed some interesting experiences. A Hagraven controlling crows? I want to see that!nnThis business has potential too. Of course, our part only comes into play if there's trouble. Let's hope there isn't.",""
"55049764-2-7719","The sky is beautiful! A little different to what I remember.nnBut the Walking City. I must find it, so I may finally return home.",""
"55049764-2-7720","We don't take kindly to strangers.",""
"55049764-2-7729","I would rather not speak to someone I don't know.",""
"55049764-2-7730","Glad to see new faces in the village. It gets lonesome seeing the same people, day in and day out.nnIf Kerbol doesn't mind, maybe you can stay a bit longer.",""
"55049764-2-7731","Head right up those steps to leave the village.",""
"55049764-2-7732","Well fought! Sai Sahan travels with worthy companions.",""
"55049764-2-7734","Go now, before the Goblins find you.",""
"55049764-2-7736","Do you mind? I'm trying to have a quiet moment to myself here.",""
"55049764-2-7745","Reynelle was a kindly one—she entered these Vaults with us, and I'd like her to leave with us, if the Mad Architect hasn't scattered her soul across Oblivion.",""
"55049764-2-7746","We long for freedom.",""
"55049764-2-7747","Now! The heart!",""
"55049764-2-7748","So, we're to stumble blindly into the catacombs beneath a crumbling ruin abandoned for an age? Lovely. That bearded idiot swordmaster will lead us straight into a trap, no doubt.",""
"55049764-2-7752","The Wyrd expect an alliance now after they murder my daughter in cold blood? They're lucky I don't have them all killed here and now!",""
"55049764-2-7753","I can't wait until this war is over. After this, I'm due for a vacation.",""
"55049764-2-7754","I'm in your debt for finding me. Elgenie says I'm going to be fine. I think Abir was more relieved than I was.",""
"55049764-2-7756","I'm not sure what you're hoping for with the girl, but I can tell you, she won't leave this ruin.",""
"55049764-2-7757","The captain will soon realize the right decision was made.",""
"55049764-2-7758","So those abominations the Dark Witnesses are herding about were once people like you and me. You should speak to Delphique. She may have something to say on this.",""
"55049764-2-7760","Perfect! One of Elgenie's I bet. This will do nicely.nnOnce you've destroyed the stores, use what's left of the poultice. It'll let you return to camp safely and quickly.",""
"55049764-2-7762","Happy to hear that <<1>> has been destroyed, but it's a terrible sad thing, what happened to Crestshade and Camp Tamrith.",""
"55049764-2-7763","Already the woods are defiled by habitation such as this. We can never recover.",""
"55049764-2-7764","Think of the glory! It'll be just like Ranser's War! We'll rescue Rivenspire and the women will swoon. It'll be great! You'll see. nnGo on to Shornhelm's chapel and tell Countess Tamrith I recruited you to the cause. I'll be along as soon as I can.",""
"55049764-2-7765","Well, that went better than expected! Not one breach of our perimeter! Guess those Baandari are good at something more than just swindling … ah, I shouldn't have said that. nnThe Knights of Saint Pelin are indebted to those cats. To you, too.",""
"55049764-2-7768","You have shown me more kindess than I deserve. I shall spend my remaining days attempting to atone and truly honor my son's memory.",""
"55049764-2-7771","Hmm. Well, there is a thing about the poultices. We do not have them just yet. nnThe good news is that I had foreseen the need for them, so I sent our herbalists out to gather what they needed. But … they haven't returned yet.",""
"55049764-2-7781","This is all the fault of the Bretons! We've been perfect neighbors, and this is the way they treat us? It's deplorable!",""
"55049764-2-7782","They took my brother. It was the Bretons. I'm sure it was.",""
"55049764-2-7785","I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about. I feel much safer now that the Fell's Brigade is here.",""
"55049764-2-7787","These Bretons are always so quick to blame others. It's a wonder they even get along with themselves.",""
"55049764-2-7790","Tell the most honorable guard how you heroically drew your weapon before chasing after that mangy cur!",""
"55049764-2-7791","Ah, you must be <<1>>'s agent.",""
"55049764-2-7792","We dislodged House Montclair from its nest. The upper city is ours and Shornhelm is free.",""
"55049764-2-7794","I can't believe that Baron Montclair would order the brazen kidnapping of Shornhelm nobles. Even if it was his general, this Reezal-Jul, who carried it out, Montclair is at the root of it. I am shocked.",""
"55049764-2-7802","<<1>> has accepted you, then? Good. We need all the help we can muster.",""
"55049764-2-7803","If they don't stop yelling at each other, I may just have to grab a switch and tan some hides. That'll give them something to cry about!",""
"55049764-2-7804","Deepswimmer doesn't fear alligators, but he fears trolls!nnThanks for saving this one's hide!",""
"55049764-2-7805","<<1>> sent you? She thinks, perhaps, you can do work for us? Who are you to know so little, yet offer so much?",""
"55049764-2-7809","Remarkable! What a strange sensation of new recollections and old. I believe that Reezal-Jul somehow removed those moments from my memory. But you were able to restore them.nnAnd now you understand what we are facing.",""
"55049764-2-7810","I know we're having problems, but I'm certain that Constable Agazu can handle it. Why the mayor allowed the militia to mobilize is beyond me.nnIt's like we're under martial law. And they closed the inn! What happens when I want a drink? What?",""
"55049764-2-7811","Are you as hungry as I am? I'm completely famished. The thrill of battle does that, you know. And flirting with death makes food taste so much better too.nnWe'll have to have a feast later. Yes, when the garrison's cleaned up.",""
"55049764-2-7813","Ah, sweet-bringer! Thank you for your kindness! You have saved me from many sleepless nights!",""
"55049764-2-7814","You look like someone who appreciates the finer things in life. I'm afraid that's in short supply right now.",""
"55049764-2-7815","Friend, you. Grateful.",""
"55049764-2-7818","Hey thanks again for all that stuff! It'll really help, you know?",""
"55049764-2-7819","Won't forget your service. Means a lot.",""
"55049764-2-7821","So much pain, it's … it's too much.",""
"55049764-2-7822","If only we had the full force of the Mages Guild behind us. These Reachmen wouldn't last long.",""
"55049764-2-7823","Walker … we may never be able to repay you for what you have done, but thank you.nnMay you dance with Jone and Jode until the end of days!",""
"55049764-2-7824","Have you heard the story of the shipwrecked Argonian? He swam from Summerset to Bal Foyen in under an hour. When the messenger arrived with word of the shipwreck, he was warm in bed with a flagon of mead.",""
"55049764-2-7825","Thank you again for finding my lost Puddles. I'd be so lonely without her.",""
"55049764-2-7827","Can't believe it's come to this. I should be leading my clan out of the Strid right now.",""
"55049764-2-7828","These animated bones—why do they seek to keep us from the relic? Are they the lingering remains of the Ayleids who once dwelled here, do you think?nnWell, they won't stop me. No matter what their reasons are, my cause is greater.",""
"55049764-2-7829","My dear friend, Verandis. I'm glad you're here. You've always been so good to our family.nnI … I never really thanked you for that.",""
"55049764-2-7830","Who invited you into our camp?",""
"55049764-2-7833","I'm going to do one last perimeter sweep and hold the north gate. Don't worry, if anything gets past us, I'll be there to help you.",""
"55049764-2-7834","What brings you into our midst?",""
"55049764-2-7835","Needless to say, this behavior is more than a little disquieting. Short temper is not one of Arkay's blessings.nnI will reserve judgment for the time being, but if he is corrupted … well, let's see what unfolds.",""
"55049764-2-7841","These fools tricked you into doing their bidding. So be it, this isn't the end of me.",""
"55049764-2-7843","Oh, hello again. I'm still waiting on a few more signatures before I can head back to Valenwood. But maybe they'd take some books instead. What've you got?",""
"55049764-2-7845","Are you a member of the Daggerfall Covenant? We need your help!",""
"55049764-2-7848","My fool of a husband can sell apples. I see an opportunity that'll make me rich!",""
"55049764-2-7849","Are you all right? Crazy Eye saw you fall! She was worried you might not get back up!",""
"55049764-2-7850","Be careful. We've been raided by Imperials for days now. Are you here to help us rebuild the camp?",""
"55049764-2-7851","<<1>> said you're headed off to kill more bandits. Keep good count, all right? I bet him it would be less than a dozen.",""
"55049764-2-7852","Dark anchors here, now? The Daedric Prince Molag Bal is surely making his presence known in Bangkorai.",""
"55049764-2-7853","I'll always treasure Dame Marcelle's sword. Perhaps it will encourage me to take up a life of honor and adventure.",""
"55049764-2-7856","Of course, the Fangs! It all makes sense now. Blessed Almalexia had a vision that the Prince of Schemes had sunk his teeth into the ground at Gil-Var-Delle.nnThe fangs she saw in her vision must be the devices Meva described.",""
"55049764-2-7857","Greetings, guild-brother. How may I help you?",""
"55049764-2-7858","Fight now, talk later.",""
"55049764-2-7860","<This bottle seems out of place, balanced on a dagger. Something seems to be inside.>",""
"55049764-2-7861","I've had it right about up to here with the Bitterhands! This has to end.nnAdusa has put much thought into this.",""
"55049764-2-7862","Good luck out there. The Blacksap are a violent bunch.",""
"55049764-2-7863","You did well, my friend. Adusa would fight at your side any time.",""
"55049764-2-7864","You should get back to <<1>> as soon as possible. He'll want to hear what we found.",""
"55049764-2-7865","Nice work. We'll get this information to the rest of the Ravenwatch as soon as I meet my contact.",""
"55049764-2-7866","Nice work. We'll get this information to the rest of the Ravenwatch as soon as I meet my contact.",""
"55049764-2-7867","Nice work. We'll get this information to the rest of the Ravenwatch as soon as I meet my contact.",""
"55049764-2-7868","I do not seek to offend you, but … you look like trouble—the kind of trouble we do not need in Fell's Run right now.nnI would suggest you simply leave town. There is nothing for you here.",""
"55049764-2-7870","Leave me alone. I'm only here for the wine.",""
"55049764-2-7871","You can always look, dearie, but don't touch. I'm a barmaid, not a trollop.",""
"55049764-2-7874","What do you say? You interested in having a bit of a laugh?",""
"55049764-2-7880","I suppose a public trial is for the best. If anyone learns we're holding <<1>> and his sons, it might rally support for another rebellion.nnAt least with a trial, there's an end to this conflict.",""
"55049764-2-7881","Can I ask your help? My husband and our dog are missing. I can see the red eyes of the undead from here. I'm worried … we're both capable with a blade, but he's no match for the undead.",""
"55049764-2-7883","<<<1>> makes a sad sound as he looks to the north.>",""
"55049764-2-7884","What a dreadful place you've discovered. When you want to return to Northpoint, just let me know.",""
"55049764-2-7887","Find my knights and bring back Arkay's relics. They are our only hope now against the dead tide.",""
"55049764-2-7889","That's the first time I've seen Queen Arzhela in the castle in days! nnThe people love her so much. I hope she returns to the throne—it would be so good for the economy … assuming we don't get slaughtered by the Reachmen, of course.",""
"55049764-2-7890","Take as much time as you like, my friend. nnIt's only the High King and the entire kingdom of Rivenspire waiting.",""
"55049764-2-7891","Burying corpses once they begin to stink is one thing, but when they've been in a damp cave for days? It's like eating hot stew on a summer day. No one likes that.",""
"55049764-2-7892","Take care of that crown, it means a lot to the people of Rivenspire",""
"55049764-2-7894","I'm glad my sons are alive and safe. I just wish they would stop bickering.",""
"55049764-2-7895","I respect the High King's decision, but I can't hold my tongue—I have serious doubts about Queen Eselde's ability to rule.nnI hope she proves me wrong, or all of Rivenspire will pay the price.",""
"55049764-2-7896","I respect your decision, and that of the High King, of course. I will do all I can to support King Alard.nnI do worry about his militaristic tendencies, though.",""
"55049764-2-7897","You draw ever closer. Graccus holds my book, the Oghma Infinium, in the ruins below.",""
"55049764-2-7898","I almost feel sorry for young Dorell. Almost. But I learned long ago, if you're going to drink to excess, you have to face the consequences.",""
"55049764-2-7899","You've returned. What have you found?",""
"55049764-2-7900","I heard you and the Prophet talking about Abnur Tharn.",""
"55049764-2-7901","Nice work, ""Hallowed."" I hope your visions weren't too frightening.",""
"55049764-2-7902","Balance will be restored before too long, I think! With laurels, wine, and crushed velvet lining, yes?",""
"55049764-2-7903","Have you secured a meeting with <<1>>?",""
"55049764-2-7904","I'm not selling anything, friend. You'll have to go inside and talk to Sabir.nnMy part in this business is in acquiring the items we sell and managing relations with our partners.",""

"55049764-2-7919","Hallowed. Strange to refer to you by that title after everything else you've done for the Dominion. But then, I suppose this was ordained in the moonlight, yes?",""
"55049764-2-7921","This one is humbled to stand before the Moon Hallowed. You have done so much for Akkhuz-ri's people … more than he has done in some time, he thinks.",""
"55049764-2-7922","Who are you? You don't look like a skeever.",""
"55049764-2-7923","I signed on with the Shornhelm Guard because Baron Dorell is a man of action. He's someone who gets things done.",""
"55049764-2-7924","Well, now that we're a big happy family, you should have <<1>> go over the plan so you know what to expect. It's going to be brutal. I can't wait.",""

"55049764-2-7929","I take <<1>> at her word, and I'm sure there's a good reason for the delay. But it looks bad when she can't construct a simple building for the people she's sworn to lead.nnI do hope <<2>> can clear things up.",""
"55049764-2-7930","<<1>>'s betrayal could not have been more absolute. She knew the details of the ratification ceremony, which puts <<2>> at risk.nnIt's my sister's own fault. She thought to appease <<c:3>> and the Mane by agreeing to this foolish process.",""

"55049764-2-7948","I should warn you. Ravenwatch Castle is as strange as the man who owns it. His family is very old, and they have … strange traditions.nnDon't worry, though. I have no doubt about the fact that he is on our side. You may rely on anything he says.",""
"55049764-2-7949","There's no use for anger. I can't say I'm happy to be here, but at least we're alive.nnAt least I know my father is still alive.",""

"55049764-2-7952","This one will need some time to consider what Verandis told you.nnVerandis is gone … I still can't believe it.",""
"55049764-2-7953","How many times must you tell a fool not to stick her hand in fire?nnOnce, and she burns herself and realizes it hurts. Twice, because she remembers it wasn't so bad and tries again. Three times? She burns to a crisp and doesn't live to try again.",""
"55049764-2-7954","I don't know you, and I don't care to know you.",""
"55049764-2-7955","You actually got the bow? Incredible. Did <<1>> give you much trouble?",""
"55049764-2-7956","This is it. The monster's lair. But no sign of Zungarg. This is … discomfiting. Keep your guard up.",""
"55049764-2-7957","Mayla and I are going to stay here a little longer. You don't have to worry about us. We'll be all right.",""
"55049764-2-7958","None of this feels real, but your help has made it easier for my brother and I. Jowan's trying so hard to be strong for me. I guess I need to do the same for him.",""
"55049764-2-7960","Today is a fortuitous day indeed for Rivenspire, though I fear other kingdoms within the Covenant may not be so lucky.nnI know that my husband considers you to be his champion, but I wonder if you might be willing to assist his queen as well.",""
"55049764-2-7961","Tread carefully, Vestige. Mannimarco's agents are everywhere. The King of Worms will not be pleased that you stole his prize captive from the Halls of Torment.",""

"55049764-2-7967","You've already done the Dominion a great service, but I need you to do a little bit more. It is finally time for the unification ritual, where an ancient ritual will prove I am fit to lead our people against our enemies.",""
"55049764-2-7968","I have a bad feeling this isn't going to turn out well—for me.",""
"55049764-2-7969","I've half a mind to go after Nedras. What in Tamriel possessed him to leave me like this?",""

"55049764-2-7971","Damn him. Damn that stupid old mule. To think I'll never see him again, to give him a swift kick in the rear.",""
"55049764-2-7972","This one is so proud of Yenadar. To give himself so that others might live. Thank you for being honest with me, traveler. I know he would have wanted me to know the truth.",""
"55049764-2-7975","Ah, it is good to see you, my generous friend. I came here to pray to Mara for forgiveness for my past, and it was like the clouds parted and the sun shined on my soul.nnI have decided to stay and devote my life to Mara. It is a better life.",""
"55049764-2-7977","We'll finish patching up these farmers and then send them south, toward Fell's Run, at the first opportunity.nnMeanwhile, go find Darien. And if he's lollygagging with some lonely farm girl instead of working, punch him in the head for me.",""
"55049764-2-7981","I think I heard a troll up near the <<1>>, so I picked up my gear and returned to the city. I don't know about you, but I wasn't eager to tangle with a troll!",""
"55049764-2-7982","During their raid the Imperial Legionaries left our pavilion alone. I guess they're not all idiots.",""
"55049764-2-7983","This region has an incredibly rich history. I'm sure there are vast repositories of lore hidden in these hills and valleys … if you know where to look, of course.",""
"55049764-2-7984","Cursed Imperials. Shooting arrows at us from behind rocks and trees… cowards all, I say.",""
"55049764-2-7985","Take the taciturn <<1>> with you, will you? I don't want to feel her slicing me to ribbons with anything but her eyes. Not until everyone's free.",""
"55049764-2-7986","Thank you for retrieving our goods, friend. At least the wounded won't go hungry now.",""
"55049764-2-7987","Do you feel the power? Can you taste it?",""
"55049764-2-7990","Thanks for your assistance with the Imperials. Now we have to deal with bandits of a different kind. These Baandari plan to gouge us, I have no doubt.",""
"55049764-2-7991","Bested by twig-boned Imperials on our own ground …. nnShameful.",""
"55049764-2-7992","Well, that was demoralizing, wasn't it? nn""Your death matters little, Emeric."" I can't believe she said that! I don't know though. Is it true?",""
"55049764-2-7996","We'll remain here to secure the area. Once Dominion reinforcements arrive, we'll figure out how the Covenant was able to conjure that portal to begin with. nnAnd if they try again, we'll have a host of armored soldiers waiting on the other side.",""

"55049764-2-8000","The mine may be lost, but with these notes I can at least continue my research. Thank you.",""
"55049764-2-8004","Face the consequences. The rest of Adeena's family is in Sentinel.",""
"55049764-2-8005","Do you feel that? It feels like another presence just entered the ruins.",""
"55049764-2-8006","It's strange to think that Najan and I will never speak again, but he deserves it. He deserves worse.",""
"55049764-2-8009","Participating in this ceremony means you accept the blessing of Mother Lamae. Will you proceed?",""
"55049764-2-8010","We lie about like whipped dogs. Ufa drags his feet, waiting for aid. Can he not see that none comes?",""
"55049764-2-8011","Hallin's Stand is a fine city. Lots of good stone work and deep bones. It should always be free.",""
"55049764-2-8012","The real mystery is what's a woman like that wanting to do in a place like this? nnShe has a prisoner, but the Chamber of Passage is not a place for holding someone, it's a place for sending someone on!",""
"55049764-2-8013","I would take back what I did if I could. I just … I didn't know things would turn out this way.nnI thought that, for Dutheil, it would simply be a matter of finding new work. I didn't intend to destroy his life. His mind.",""
"55049764-2-8014","Stop interrupting, Dark Elf!nnExcuse, please. What else can Zur assist you with?",""
"55049764-2-8015","You have all the tools you need to save <<1>> with you. That greedy and cowardly man has few defenses.",""
"55049764-2-8016","I just want to see my mother and father again!",""
"55049764-2-8020","We slipped the farmers out and sent them south with a few soldiers. Now I'm ready to break a few Montclair heads!",""
"55049764-2-8021","Mind the furs. It takes hours to comb out the snarls.",""
"55049764-2-8023","Lovely day for a drink, wouldn't you say?",""
"55049764-2-8024","We follow the Green Pact in this home. Respect this, and we'll do the same for you.",""
"55049764-2-8025","My father thinks he's the alchemist in the family, but mother always said I'd surpass his skills.",""
"55049764-2-8026","The new treethane is a joke!",""
"55049764-2-8027","You should go. I'm not playing this lute for you.",""
"55049764-2-8028","I know you, brother. You're one of us, even if you don't know it yet. Hircine calls you. His song is in your blood.",""
"55049764-2-8031","What happened to you? It looked like you were in a daze for a few moments.",""
"55049764-2-8034","Leave me. There's nothing you can do.",""
"55049764-2-8035","I may have little time left before the Imperials find me. Let me pray in peace.",""

"55049764-2-8040","Thank you. Take this vial and fill it with the waters from this basin. The water must be taken by the one who carries it. With that done, make for the falls that feed into Gil-Var-Delle and pour the water at each crest. Nature will do the rest.",""
"55049764-2-8042","Oh, I know you! You must be the one her beautiful ladyship has been expecting!",""
"55049764-2-8044","Would you look at that line? We're drawing more people than in <<1>>!",""

"55049764-2-8055","Do you have them? You have them, don't you?nnOh, I shouldn't get my hopes up. They fell in the sea, didn't they? I knew it, I have the worst luck.",""
"55049764-2-8057","Look at them, limbs so sluggish and carapaces dreadfully dull. When you've raised the shalks since they were pupae, it gnaws at your heart to see them so listless.",""
"55049764-2-8058","You didn't drop a single one, I'm impressed! Come to think of it, I have been needing an apprentice ….",""
"55049764-2-8059","Oh, Edouard, you foolish man. Now look what you've done.",""
"55049764-2-8060","Have you found anything I could use? I've told our guests I'm still preparing, but they're eager to hear my stories.",""
"55049764-2-8062","This High Elf thinks that his people rule over me. The Wood Elves follow King Camoran, not some High Elf Queen! Am I right?",""
"55049764-2-8063","This Wood Elf doesn't realize he would be dead without Queen Ayrenn and the Altmer.nnSuch disrespect. We risk life and limb to save them and they thank us with  accusations and insults!",""
"55049764-2-8067","Now, where did I leave that scroll?nnYou'll have to excuse me. Just doing a bit of housekeeping.",""
"55049764-2-8068","I overheard what <<1>> intends to do in order to pad out his research journal, and if I wasn't still sickened from this poisonous spider bite I surely would be now.",""

"55049764-2-8078","They're so cute together.",""
"55049764-2-8081","Oh—a visitor. Greetings. We don't get many walk-ins these days. ""Curfew and regulations"" from what I hear. nnCouldn't have been easy getting past all those Imperials. Maybe you should think about membership in the Fighters Guild.",""
"55049764-2-8082","Wouldn't trust Ludippe with my coin purse, but his eyes are good enough. Let's have a look inside, shall we?",""
"55049764-2-8084","Is that? Yes! I can tell by the runes. The slight alterations in the design and structure is unique to the Valenwood Ayleids. I would be greatly interested in reassembling and studying this tablet if you are willing to part with it.",""

"55049764-2-8090","Welcome to the guildhall, friend. Found any interesting books or scrolls? Please just place them on the desk. nnWe had a grimoire come in yesterday with troll fat all over it … so… safety first.",""
"55049764-2-8091","Ah, that's better!",""
"55049764-2-8095","Tell this High Elf she's being ridiculous. Yes, moon sugar is used to make skooma, but Khajiit use it as a spice! It's a facet of Khajiiti cultural cuisine!nnMoon-sugar shouldn't be regulated because some people use it for the wrong reasons!",""
"55049764-2-8096","Set this Khajiit straight! Moon sugar has important cultural significance to the Khajiiti, but some people—especially the Khajiit—use moon sugar to make the drug skooma.nnMaking moon sugar illegal hinders skooma vendors—and that's a good thing.",""
"55049764-2-8100","Thank you. Take this ice rune. Captain Gemelle gave it to me to freeze the webs trapping the others. It should make them brittle enough for our soldiers to break free.",""

"55049764-2-8211","Ever get that feeling you've walked into a place you don't belong? No? Think about it ….nnI'm saying you don't belong here.",""
"55049764-2-8213","Fascinating, isn't it? To think that such a tiny rock could hold so much power. Can you feel it? It's like it's calling to me. Like the moons call to the tides.nnImagine what the relic it came from could do!",""
"55049764-2-8215","What're you looking at? The song's over.",""
"55049764-2-8218","Do I come and bother you while you're eating? No? Think about that while you turn around and walk away.",""
"55049764-2-8219","I brought enough food for an army but without the performers bringing in the crowds I'm worried it's all going to spoil.",""
"55049764-2-8224","Hey there, milksop. You stared an ancient, unfathomable evil in the eye, causing you to question your sanity, mortality, and very concept of the self yet?",""
"55049764-2-8226","I love every one of the stories Noryon tells, but I hear the Magic Act is beyond belief, so I'm going to keep checking back until they start.",""
"55049764-2-8227","My friend, this table is for the worthy, the bold.nnAnd this one thinks you don't look like either.",""
"55049764-2-8229","Pray pardon me, I wish to keep company with my friends here. Perhaps we could speak another time.",""
"55049764-2-8231","You must be ….nnYou must be … you must be … incredibly stupid to come talk to me.",""
"55049764-2-8234","Huh?",""
"55049764-2-8236","Move along. It's been a while since I stabbed anything, and I'm getting itchy.",""
"55049764-2-8242","Step away … step away, you … fool!nnOr I'll make sure no one will ever remember your name! Because all they'll see is a fool who's been … beaten into the ground.",""

"55049764-2-8247","Go away. I've got nothing for you. This table's for the Undaunted. What counts as Undaunted in these parts, anyway.",""
"55049764-2-8250","Are you Undaunted? No. Get out of here … uh … daunted.",""

"55049764-2-8269","I only need one good eye to send you to your grave mongrel. Best you be off. This table's for Undaunted only.",""
"55049764-2-8270","Looking for any work not related to carnivals. Let me know if you have any leads.",""
"55049764-2-8271","Would you look at that line? We're drawing more people than in <<1>>!",""
"55049764-2-8272","What sort of mischief have you been up to now? No, don't tell me. I'm keen to guess! nnUm … is it larger than a breadbasket?",""
"55049764-2-8278","I sell adventuring supplies, kit, and the like.nnI'm open for business, but I'm warning you—try to steal from me and I'll knock your teeth out. I've got a necklace I'm working on, and I can always use more teeth.",""
"55049764-2-8279","I, Boeuf Sterone, have no fear of thieves. For first and foremost, thieves do not steal food if it's poisoned!nnMy food is not poisoned, trust me. It's a trick to ward off the thieves, yes? Anything you buy from Boeuf Sterone is safe to eat.",""
"55049764-2-8281","Well, that's something, at least. Now we can get this ceremony business out of the way. This rabble will learn what a true ruler looks like.",""
"55049764-2-8283","Huh, who are you?",""
"55049764-2-8293","You should speak with Glaras if you wish to join the Briars. Otherwise, I have nothing to say to you.",""

"55049764-2-8297","Thank you once again for seeing my brother safely back to the village. He may cause my hair to fall out before I've seen a thirtieth winter, but I don't know what I'd do without him.",""
"55049764-2-8298","You've made Ivarstead safer for all, and for that you'll always find welcome here.",""
"55049764-2-8300","You're back. What happened? Did you stick something long and sharp through that crazy lizard's blackened heart?",""
"55049764-2-8303","How long does it take to count our pay? Go talk to their elder. We deserve some compen … compla … gold for all the trouble we've caused.nnBeen through! All the trouble we've been through! None of it in the contract, either.",""
"55049764-2-8304","It feels damn good to get out and swing my weapon. As my father used to say: ""Idle minds are Oblivion's playground, idle bodies get fat.""",""
"55049764-2-8305","I believe you and I have nothing more to discuss. Know that were it not for your deeds, I would personally avenge Lyris' death here and now.nnThe thought tempts more with every passing moment.",""
"55049764-2-8306","It has been a while since we've spoken, Vest— friend. You look well.",""
"55049764-2-8309","Never much time to chat, it seems. <<1>> wants to know how well we've fulfilled our contract, and you're the only neutral person around.nnI hope you can give a good report of our work.",""
"55049764-2-8310","They speak in circles, like city-people do. What do they mean? And why do they smell so much like the harpies?",""
"55049764-2-8311","You can't leave us out to dry. We're good, mostly honest fellows. Trying to make a living. You're not so different than us when it comes down to it.",""
"55049764-2-8316","You know how hard we worked for them, right? Toughest job we've ever had.",""
"55049764-2-8317","I don't see Althen. If you have questions, that's fine, but at this point, I'm counting on you.nnYou don't want to disappoint the Ring of Daggers, do you?",""
"55049764-2-8318","Damn bastard Gavendien! Did it all for the jewels, and got away with it, too!nnHe got me good. I'll survive, but he cut Lauravieve's throat. He didn't have to! He just did it to prove a point. I thought I could be cruel, but he is a monster!",""
"55049764-2-8319","We did everything they told us to, but somehow we still failed. How will I ever make this right?",""
"55049764-2-8320","They were using my mill, the bastards! And look what they did to the poor jeweler!",""
"55049764-2-8321","I'm sorry, but the jewelry shop is closed for today.",""
"55049764-2-8322","No, no. I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to stay right here. Yes. Right here.",""
"55049764-2-8323","Praise the Eight! Did you kick that stupid thug's teeth in? I don't know what was worse—being held hostage or smelling that ruffian's breath!nnWhat about the robbery, though? Did you stop them or did they get away with the jewels?",""
"55049764-2-8324","I can't wait to see my father again. I hope he's all right.",""
"55049764-2-8325","Why? Why would they kill her? She was cooperating! She gave them the jewels!",""
"55049764-2-8328","I'm yours to do with as you will. Whatever you decide, I will go along. My fate is in your hands.",""
"55049764-2-8330","Don't feel bad. I knew Julien was a hopeless case. A man who's sick in love is a sad man indeed. nnI feel sorry for him, really. Enlisting would have probably helped set him straight.",""
"55049764-2-8333","Remarkable. It appears to be an intact volume of Ayleid lore. If it's real, then this is what we came here to ….nnNo. This can't be correct.",""
"55049764-2-8336","Nice of you to finally join us. Those damn Montclairs have locked me out of my own city!nnIf any of my people have been hurt, I'll kill Montclair and his daughter with my bare hands.",""

"55049764-2-8342","You can reach the Pass by traveling west along the northern coast. And when we get there, I intend to make Montclair pay for the damage and sorrow he has brought to Rivenspire.",""
"55049764-2-8343","It seems that some of my loyal subjects have become dissatisfied with my leadership. Think that I have been blinded by the Light that shines so brightly around me.nnWell, to Oblivion with them! To Oblivion with him! I don't have time for this now.",""
"55049764-2-8345","If we don't get Gwendis out of there soon, those restraints will break and she'll feed on the nobles.",""

"55049764-2-8347","How wonderful it is, to have everyone safe at home! We owe you everything, my friend. I do hope you'll visit. We could go to the windmill and you can tell me all your stories!",""

"55049764-2-8349","Destroy the <<1>>. It's … it's the only way to make sure this never happens again.",""
"55049764-2-8350","I'll be more understanding with <<1>>. I promise. With Federic leaving … mind you, I still don't approve. But she is a good lass. She doesn't deserve what I did to her.",""
"55049764-2-8351","I knew it! You lost your spine, didn't you?nnThat's fine. I'll be here a bit longer if you get it back. Otherwise, goodbye to you and your stupid Shornhelm Guard.",""
"55049764-2-8354","You're right, again. They do.",""
"55049764-2-8357","I must tell you the rules before you ready yourself for the race.",""
"55049764-2-8359","There is no way I'm sticking around here to shovel horse dung for the rest of my life.nnI got big dreams, and I got the skills to make them happen.",""

"55049764-2-8368","Well done! I'll follow in a moment. I find this room strangely calming and I want to look around.",""
"55049764-2-8369","What is your decision? We need your help.",""
"55049764-2-8372","Did I see the flutter of butterfly wings? It must have been a trick of the light.",""
"55049764-2-8373","Oh look. You're that nosy, fobbing arse who talked me into joining the Shornhelm Guard, aren't you?nnTalk about a nightmare. All that marching … I actually prefer to be here in the stocks, and it's clearly where I belong.",""
"55049764-2-8374","Hey there. You the one Queen Maraya bought passage for to Sentinel? All right.nnI'm just glad you didn't bring along a chest full of luggage. We got to row out to the Posset in this little dinghy here. Real glamorous, eh?",""
"55049764-2-8375","My friend from Hoarfrost! These two wouldn't be here if not for you. You should be proud.nJulien and Shuga have turned out to be great soldiers.nnMartin couldn't cut it, though. Abandoned his post one night. I hear he's back in the stocks again.",""
"55049764-2-8377","I'm really enjoying the soldier's life. The thrill of battle, the rush of victory—these are real feelings.nnI'm thinking about staying in the Guard. Mad as it may be, now that I know Guendeline's waiting for me, I don't really like her any more.",""
"55049764-2-8379","Strange times, my friend, strange times indeed. And you know what strange times call for? A drink!",""
"55049764-2-8383","I'm not the seer my grandmother was. She didn't need to hear any gossip. Oh, no! She knew long before anyone else what trouble I'd be in. How I miss her!nnTell me what happened; the bones are unclear.",""
"55049764-2-8384","Doom has come to Craglorn! The stars have vanished from the sky! nnWill no one listen? Will no one help?",""
"55049764-2-8385","Stay safe out there. Lots of things that want to kill you.",""
"55049764-2-8386","Thanks again for everything you've done. I'll take some time with the amulet to see if it could be of further use to us.nnIf you're looking for other ways to aid us, Hara might have some suggestions on where to go.",""
"55049764-2-8388","Glory has no patience for the idle. Go prove your worth against the Reachmen in Shor's Stone.",""
"55049764-2-8390","I'm just going to sit right here until all this nonsense between the nobles blows over.",""
"55049764-2-8391","Montclair is responsible for all this madness? Hard to believe. He was always kind to me.",""
"55049764-2-8392","The city is safe now, and do you know why? Because Baron Dorell took charge and showed Montclair's lackeys the business side of his boot!",""
"55049764-2-8393","The Light shines on Shornhelm and the Countess! Thanks to them, the city is safe again and Montclair is on the run.",""
"55049764-2-8394","They say the city is safe now, but how can they be sure? Baron Montclair's followers could be all around us, waiting for another opportunity to rise up and strike!",""
"55049764-2-8395","They say it wasn't really the Baron who attacked us. It was some kind of mad Argonian. I never did trust those overgrown lizards!",""
"55049764-2-8396","Welcome back to the Hall! How goes the search?",""
"55049764-2-8397","I suppose I'm lucky I made it out alive, but by the Three I'm glad you came along.nnIf I'd failed here, I think my captain would've had my head.",""
"55049764-2-8398","Good, good. I think I'll have a sit down out here. The wind seems very gooey, doesn't it? Very squishy. Ugh.",""
"55049764-2-8399","Don't worry about me. I'll be waiting here with these rented guar, my carts, and the stench of decomposing guards. No rush.",""
"55049764-2-8401","Soldier, report. What brings you to Ash Mountain? Did Holgunn send you?",""
"55049764-2-8403","Damn those Covenant bastards! It seems like they're fighting us at every turn.",""
"55049764-2-8404","When I was a kid back home in Riften, we'd kill any mudcrab we saw. Ensured they didn't get out of control.nnThat's how I feel about these Covenant soldiers. If we don't kill them all, they'll just keep coming.",""
"55049764-2-8405","I left the mines to breathe fresh air and swing my blade for the Pact. Then I get posted to this place. I think I'd rather go back to the mines. Hah!",""
"55049764-2-8406","Three guide your blade, soldier. Get out there and make us proud!",""
"55049764-2-8407","Thanks. Not many willing to help these days, especially a dusty Ashlander like me.nnWe'd planned to rest up at the Davenas' farm near Kragenmoor before passing through the Deshaan gate. He should know it.",""
"55049764-2-8409","I am so doomed.nnAnd it feels like there are a dozen horses dancing the Wood Elf frolic directly behind my left eye.",""
"55049764-2-8410","Is there something I can do for you? I really am rather busy at the moment.",""
"55049764-2-8412","Thank you for your help, I feel better knowing you're out there helping look for my Puddles.",""
"55049764-2-8417","That was considerably faster than I expected, thanks to your assistance.",""
"55049764-2-8418","Thank you for helping Priest Marnest. I feel better with you accompanying him. You never know if there are any more of those damn vampires hiding nearby.",""
"55049764-2-8421","Don't ask me why we're here. I have no idea. Someone seemed to think we needed to be here to keep Stormhaven safe.nnI haven't seen the rest of the kingdom, but this part's as dull as dirt.",""
"55049764-2-8422","Get out there and find the last of them. Northpoint won't rest easy as long as a single one of Lleraya's vampires remains within its walls.",""
"55049764-2-8424","I don't know how much more of this I can bear. nnWaiting for the general to call us back to the fight against the Ironhand Ogres—it's gnawing right through my nerves.",""
"55049764-2-8428","Bad time to visit the city, traveler. Might want to move along.",""
"55049764-2-8429","Hurry, hurry! I'll meet you outside!",""
"55049764-2-8432","Well, hello there! I certainly hope you've found something worthwhile to read in your travels. The selection here has been rather slim. I've resorted to reading cook books! nnOn the plus side, the dinners I've made taste much better.",""
"55049764-2-8446","My Lord Vivec, I bear the most grievous news. Belronen Telvanni challenged me to a duel of blood. I regret to say I won.nnIt was a small cut upon the arm, enough to settle the matter. But he fell dead!",""
"55049764-2-8450","You must go to Bramblebreach. There is nothing more to say.",""
"55049764-2-8452","You have my thanks, traveler. And the thanks of every guard in Skywatch.",""
"55049764-2-8454","Hey there. Saw the carts, eh? Sorry, nobody out here but the help. The Queen herself is still in Vulkhel Guard.",""
"55049764-2-8455","My brother—the plague boils his blood and ravages his body. I fear he doesn't have much time, but he wants to talk to you.",""
"55049764-2-8456","It's terrible. My book's gone. Years of my life wasted!",""
"55049764-2-8457","Oh, look at me! I'm a terrible mess! You really must excuse my dreadful appearance. I haven't been feeling very well lately.nnBy the way, you haven't seen Nostrum Breva, have you? She promised to bring me more of the Maulborn curative.",""
"55049764-2-8460","Do you hear that? It tastes like yellow ….",""
"55049764-2-8461","We're a family again thanks to you!",""
"55049764-2-8462","It is good to see a friendly face. Greenshade is a far more exciting place than Raz expected.nnHe hears now that the Staff of Magnus has been stolen? As if these rebellious Bosmer rebels weren't trouble enough!",""
"55049764-2-8463","Don't come near me! Are you real?",""
"55049764-2-8464","You're not a daedra. What's going on?",""
"55049764-2-8465","You are a miracle worker. Without your help many people would still be in the clutches of the daedra.",""
"55049764-2-8470","You've done the fallen warriors proud. We completed our mission. That's got to stand for something.",""
"55049764-2-8471","Please. Stop the Maulborn and destroy their ability to make more of this damn plague.nnJust be careful. The chamber ahead is crawling with an army of plague husks.",""
"55049764-2-8478","You are a miracle worker. Without your help many people would be dead or dying.",""
"55049764-2-8484","How very strange? What in the name of Oblivion were the Maulborn thinking when they mixed these toxic ingredients together?nnOh, are you back again?",""
"55049764-2-8485","The Eight guide your hand, traveler. You may be the only one who can restore this holy site.",""
"55049764-2-8486","Though I have no sense of sentiment, I am able to understand that her intentions are natural and even have merit.nnNonetheless, there are larger matters at stake here. This is the way it must be.",""
"55049764-2-8487","Stendarr guide your hand. You may be the only one who can restore this holy site.",""

"55049764-2-8493","Please, hurry! I know you can do this. I have faith in you!",""
"55049764-2-8494","I can't leave the tree! Erunor and I must stay here as its last defense! Go, help the villagers below!",""
"55049764-2-8496","You did it? Well done! I never doubted you for an instant.nnNow, let me have the mixture, if you please.",""
"55049764-2-8497","If I were a few years younger and my hands were still steady, I'd do this for you. But I'm not and they aren't, so you're just going to have to go over to the alchemy table and get this done.",""
"55049764-2-8498","I hope Nilyne can put those healing herbs to good use.",""
"55049764-2-8499","I love listening to the sounds out here. It's rather peaceful, don't you think?",""
"55049764-2-8508","Three keep you, traveler. Welcome to the Davon's Watch Guildhall. What brings you to our doorstep?",""
"55049764-2-8509","Hello. I understand you've been helping Hara study the Celestials. We're truly grateful for your aid.",""
"55049764-2-8512","Do you know how much gold I've spent to get my wife here? And now the Maulborn have stopped providing their curative?nnI'd trade my entire estate if it meant the plague would release its hold on my wife.",""
"55049764-2-8513","Hello again, my slick-scaled friend. Have you been to the Armature yet? And did I ever tell you about Emberflint?",""
"55049764-2-8514","Mimic the water and flow and we will have no cause to inflict angry pain upon each other.nnThe Maulborn discarded these crates, so now they belong to us.",""
"55049764-2-8515","Those damn Maulborn stink flies! They refuse to give us the curative, just because they call us lizards and look down upon us.nnSo we'll take the curative. As soon as we can find any.",""
"55049764-2-8516","We were hoping to find something good in these crates, but the Maulborn don't seem to throw away anything valuable.nnTake whatever you want. Especially cheese. I hate cheese.",""
"55049764-2-8525","You're so lucky! Verandis never let's me go on dream-walks with him.",""
"55049764-2-8528","Traveler. How goes your survey of Zabamat? Have you found Hightide Hollow, as yet?",""
"55049764-2-8533","Don't mind my good-for-nothing egg-siblings. They're young, bored, and stupid.nnRest assured, I shall continue to remain open throughout this time of crisis.",""
"55049764-2-8537","Why'd we ever come to this island? It's so out of the way. At least <<1>> promised us extra pay for this.",""
"55049764-2-8538","Life is so precious, and so fleeting. Don't let it pass you by. Take time to feel the caress of the wind and listen to the way it carries the sound of your true love's name.nnMirilir … I never did hear anything so sweet and so dear.",""
"55049764-2-8543","I'm rather fond of Estre. High Kinlady Estre, that is. So noble, just, and Altmer through and through. She'll keep us strong.",""
"55049764-2-8547","Who knew that so many afflicted would flock to the Serk! All these people. They're so … sick.",""
"55049764-2-8550","Welcome to Shrouded Hollow! Will you be sojourning with us? Or are you simply a visitor?",""
"55049764-2-8556","These are dark times, and the Star-Gazers are a shadow of who we once were. But our role remains more important than ever.",""
"55049764-2-8557","Always work to do! Keeps one very busy, yes?",""
"55049764-2-8559","The Sword-Disciples are still in thrall to the Serpent. Anything you can do to put them to rest would ease my mind.",""

"55049764-3-75","I can't thank you enough for killing Necanis. We can handle the rest of the rabble ourselves. You are always welcome here.",""
"55049764-3-94","Look for Thetis south of Grayborne. His house is midway between here and the lake.",""
"55049764-3-96","We heard about you fighting the undead! We aspire to your heights.",""
"55049764-3-98","We've heard about you driving back the undead. Impressive.",""
"55049764-3-123","The Bloody Eye are not a simple group of mystics, stranger. We direct our vision into more than just the simple physical realm of flesh that we stand in now. We are guardians of the Veil.",""
"55049764-3-124","Do not worry for my companions. They will take care of things on their end. We have our own duties we must attend to.",""
"55049764-3-125","In order to push out the darkness of this land, we ourselves must become part of it.",""
"55049764-3-126","They think you are the one? Heh, let us see if your spirit is not simply ripped to shreds.",""
"55049764-3-136","These are dark times. Even Tamarus is showing signs of the madness! He wants help from those who would practice the dark arts. There's a reason why those mystics hide in the mountains!",""
"55049764-3-140","It is done.. We've struck a blow to Coldun that will set them back a good time.. but they will return with a force that we will not be able to stop...",""
"55049764-3-161","Our failure has unleashed spirits of anger and torment, who menace Camlorn. We must stop them!",""
"55049764-3-171","When you've completed your patrol, we'll speak again.",""
"55049764-3-175","I fear the undead will haunt Northmoor forever.",""
"55049764-3-177","I hope the holy water fulfilled its purpose.",""
"55049764-3-181","Together, we will stop this evil.",""
"55049764-3-191","Slowly, the nightmares of Silvermist shrink back. You are a force to be reckoned with, friend.",""
"55049764-3-192","I am glad to see that even in these dark times, High Rock still has heroes. What is your concern?",""
"55049764-3-193","I'm glad the matter we discussed has been, er, dealt with. nnRest assured, the Duke of Camlorn does not forget his friends.",""
"55049764-3-194","Let me know which potions work and which don't... and be careful. I haven't finished testing those yet.",""
"55049764-3-197","Being raised as undead is horrible, but I worry that the Blackhand's plans are far worse.",""
"55049764-3-198","At least now we know what we're facing. nnMeanwhile, Gloria has discovered something important about how Faolchu came to power.",""
"55049764-3-200","The Unusual Thorn that you found reeks of magic.",""
"55049764-3-201","Ah, back with Shava's roots; you are a good and useful assistant to Shava!",""
"55049764-3-204","May you never feel this pain, my friend. Even love is not worth the price of eternal torment.",""
"55049764-3-205","We'll handle the rest, and we'll help Camlorn rebuild. I'm certain you now face bigger challenges.",""
"55049764-3-206","One less nuisance to deal with... and one step closer to retaking Camlorn. When these cursed werewolves are all in the ground, the first round is on me.",""
"55049764-3-213","You've done quite a service for Deleyn's Mill, <<1>>. Thank you.",""
"55049764-3-216","My sister must have tried to banish the corruption on her own. Where she failed, we must succeed.",""
"55049764-3-217","Had any luck finding harpy feathers?",""
"55049764-3-218","Well met, my fellow adventurer! You are an adventurer, right?",""
"55049764-3-219","Present the wyrd offering in the center of our ritual site. Stand between the five standing stones. I pray the spirits will listen.",""
"55049764-3-222","I have no right to ask more of you, but... would you do us one last favor?",""
"55049764-3-226","The spirits chose you as their champion. Once they chose me, as well.nnNow we must work together to restore the land's purity.",""
"55049764-3-227","Ormax expects us to make up for all our lost time.",""
"55049764-3-228","At least we have our health and work to do, eh?",""
"55049764-3-229","Ormax wants us to double our efforts.",""
"55049764-3-235","Thanks to you, we can all get back to work. A blessing an a curse, to be sure. nnStill, you have my thanks.",""
"55049764-3-251","Look, I gave you the money. I don't know what more you could want from me. nnYou should leave before someone gets suspicious.",""
"55049764-3-263","Vartisan Ameralee must have a solution to our dilemma. Pray speak with her at once, Numinous.",""
"55049764-3-264","Felicitous greetings, and welcome to the Kinhouse of the Felballin!",""
"55049764-3-267","Place the Sload Lure on the Sun Column found on the furthest island to the southwest.",""
"55049764-3-268","The Elementals' work was not to be interrupted, but such is the folly of the Maormer. Please return their Piths using the Fissures.",""
"55049764-3-269","Would you mind standing back ? You are rather filthy.",""
"55049764-3-270","You have already recovered the Varla Lens and Hainen's book? My, you have been busy while I was... detained. May I see them, please?",""
"55049764-3-312","You have done us a great service. Yet more remains, if we are to restore the Varlines of Isque.",""
"55049764-3-313","Isque Roses grow along the river, just to the northeast.",""
"55049764-3-314","Those foul witches shall be purged from these shores. By the Fugue of Arbis, I swear it so.",""
"55049764-3-315","By the sound of it I divine you have found us a Blessed Bell.",""
"55049764-3-316","Ah, you have returned. I take it you repulsed the Zombies?",""
"55049764-3-318","Not even werewolves can stand against us for long.",""
"55049764-3-319","Have you collected Fire Salts from the Incendiaries?",""
"55049764-3-321","What is that rattling noise?",""
"55049764-3-322","Have you checked on my soul gem?",""
"55049764-3-323","I'd follow Magus Commander Danain into Oblivion itself.",""
"55049764-3-325","Truly, you have much to teach us, Numinous.",""
"55049764-3-327","I appreciate your help. With the wounded coming and going, every ally who can help is a blessing from the Divines!",""
"55049764-3-328","Apothecaries like myself write down only useful cures. You can rub a stone on a wart during the waning moon, then bury the stone to cure your warts. And then there's...what's that? Foxglove Nectar. Oh! Of course!",""
"55049764-3-329","The shriek of Stormwitches confirms your success.",""
"55049764-3-330","So Blain tracked me. I wish I could thank him for not turning me in. You must not think very highly of me, deserting as I did.",""
"55049764-3-331","The champion of Auri-El returns. Honor and praise, Numinous.",""
"55049764-3-332","I defer to your wisdom, Optimate. May your travels be blessed.",""
"55049764-3-338","Would you favor us by playing the Sacred Instrument near at hand? Be not bashful.",""
"55049764-3-339","It is time for Nirn to brighten our sky once again.",""
"55049764-3-341","You have my thanks, Optimate.",""
"55049764-3-342","You must enlist the aid of the Exemplars at the Shrines around The Orrery. Only then can we know what threat we face.",""
"55049764-3-343","Poor Vilmo, blind to the truth which I have seen. He must be enlightened.",""
"55049764-3-344","What news have you of Skyharker Suuniqwe?",""
"55049764-3-345","There's no time to waste. We have to reactivate the Midnight Talisman before Angof can react.",""
"55049764-3-346","Have you found the book yet? It must have fallen somewhere below. I pray it did not fall in the water!",""
"55049764-3-347","With the power of the Midnight Talisman, we may finally be able to strike at Angof directly. Let's not tarry.",""
"55049764-3-348","With the Varla Lens missing, the lines of power connecting this Kinship to the Orrery have gone down. Were the Varlines to be restored, I could transport you to the Orrery swiftly and safely.",""
"55049764-3-350","It is good to be whole again. I thank you for this.",""
"55049764-3-352","I cannot leave Ackers, but please, help my friends. I'll tend the nightblade's wounds.",""
"55049764-3-354","You've given me peace of mind at last.nnI will always mourn the loss of my son, but knowing that he died well fills me with pride.",""
"55049764-3-356","Now that we have the Midnight Talisman, it's time to reactivate it. We'll need your help.",""
"55049764-3-359","Cursed cats! All my rats were gone in moments. What a dervish of destruction!nnI hope for your sake, friend, that you had nothing to do with this.",""
"55049764-3-360","Speak to Langdruun within the Kinhouse. He will be expecting you.",""
"55049764-3-361","I trust your call upon the Battlereeve went well. If you will excuse me, I have orders to attend. Fortune favor thee, Numinous.",""
"55049764-3-371","Al'kari is pleased to see you again, hero of chickens.",""
"55049764-3-373","The Gem Spiders can be found in the rear of the Menagerie to the north.",""
"55049764-3-384","What's your business here?",""
"55049764-3-385","Hurry to Crosswych, <<1>>. Old Man Murell's going to want to meet you",""
"55049764-3-386","May the Ascendants watch over you, Numinous.",""
"55049764-3-388","That will be all, my young Numinous.",""
"55049764-3-390","The best place to find a brush pile would be the cliffs northwest of here. Be on your guard.",""
"55049764-3-393","Trade is the lifeblood of these isles. Those who yet say it is magic are simply envious.",""
"55049764-3-394","Despite the failing of the Varlines and the rise of Orgnavar, trade yet flows through Orrery.",""
"55049764-3-402","With the Varlines awry, our own magic books are a danger to us. I fear my mother was attacked.",""
"55049764-3-408","I have inspected the Orc skull.",""
"55049764-3-411","Glory is to be won on the beaches. Yet here I stand, barring the door.nnI am told it is an honorable duty.",""
"55049764-3-413","The Syldarim of The Orrery have sent an Emissary bearing a message of unity. I am grateful for your deeds, Numinous.",""
"55049764-3-419","Back for more, <<1>>? Fortunately the Maormer have deserted this site, now that the Welkynd Stone is safely back in our hands.",""
"55049764-3-423","Perhaps we could speak some other time, Optimate.",""
"55049764-3-424","There are many wounded soldiers I must tend to.",""
"55049764-3-426","Please, you can't take my husband. I know he's sorry for what he did.",""
"55049764-3-429","I miss my friend. I know you did what you felt was right, but all the same, perhaps you should have let Moreau be.nnMy ring is still missing, the real thief remains at large, and a man who made a mistake is in prison.",""
"55049764-3-431","Come you with passion in your heart? Sweet words on your lips?",""
"55049764-3-432","Need to go. Have to go. Stars flying by. Wind in my mane. Bored here.",""
"55049764-3-433","I hope you gave that despicable thief a fitting punishment for his crime.",""
"55049764-3-447","You stand at the gates of The Orrery, Optimate.",""
"55049764-3-455","Could I break my bond with my model planet, I would have left the Orrery already.",""
"55049764-3-464","Praise and honor to you, Optimate!",""
"55049764-3-467","Sir Hughes has turned himself in, and Alcaire is in your debt. nnI have one last request of you.",""
"55049764-3-470","If you're here for a drink, talk to Ruhamza... if he has any ale left.",""
"55049764-3-471","Everyone's gone mad! I've been praying that you don't suffer from this affliction, <<1>>.nnThe fear, the pain, the uncertainty... they're the real enemies, aren't they? nnThe darkness is coming to engulf us all.",""
"55049764-3-474","They're out to get her. nnI've got to protect her reputation. nnShe's my friend. Dabienne would do the same for me, wouldn't she?",""
"55049764-3-476","This whole thing was like some terrible nightmare. It reminds me of the day I lost my husband so many years ago.nnI don't know if you can understand. I've moved on, but sometimes, I still feel a little lonely.",""
"55049764-3-477","There's a few less Daedra in the world now, I bet. What have you collected?",""
"55049764-3-479","<<1>> will meet you at the entrance to the mews.nnBe swift. We know not how much longer Lord Montclair will keep his prisoners alive.",""
"55049764-3-482","As much as I want to rush out and put <<1>>'s head on a pike, I have a responsibility to these people.nnJonah is a strange one, but I doubt he can fend for himself, let alone protect his mother. I hope you can find them quickly.",""
"55049764-3-485","So we meet again. Did Calden send you, or is this concerning another matter?",""
"55049764-3-486","You bring warning from Fahjiri? I'll have words with that cat - she has more to do with this than she admits. Your warning comes late. Look in on Durak, then return to me.",""
"55049764-3-496","I wonder what Duke Nathaniel might gain from the murder of the duchess....nnNobles are never above advancing their position through monstrous acts.nnOf course, I'm just a courtier. What would I know of such things?",""
"55049764-3-497","The memories of my fallen comrades rest in the walls of this hall. Those memories will give me strength in the coming fight.nnI'm ready to face the forces threatening us.",""
"55049764-3-500","I've seen to the captives. You've done good work here.nnTime will tell if Lady Eselde can protect them from Lord Montclair, and themselves.",""
"55049764-3-501","We must destroy the corrupted nereids!",""
"55049764-3-502","Just back from the docks, are you? nnThe Midnight Swell used to be a safe ship, back when Captain Lash was the captain. nnNo doubt its new captain threw the old one overboard. Fed him to the water Dreugh, I bet. nnYou'd best be wary near that lot.",""
"55049764-3-504","You've saved our family, <<1>>, when no one else would help us.nnWe can't trust anyone but you.",""
"55049764-3-507","You've defeated the evil that caused us so much suffering, but I still have to endure his curse.nnI tried to save these people. Why am I the one who's being punished?",""
"55049764-3-510","The Orcs use anchors to keep this shield in place. nnThey've scattered them about the ruins, and they guard them closely.",""
"55049764-3-511","Watch your step here, stranger. I've got an eye on you.",""
"55049764-3-512","The Divines will not forget what you've done for an innocent. Neither will I.",""
"55049764-3-513","All's quiet on my watch. Thank the Divines for small blessings.",""
"55049764-3-515","My brother is beside me again. We are together in death, as we were in life.",""
"55049764-3-519","I dread the prospect of having to do battle with my fellow knights. nnNonetheless, it must be done. I've ordered the knights who have joined our cause to take up strategic positions around the keep.",""
"55049764-3-520","<<1>> is gone! I can't find her anywhere in the camp.nnShe shouldn't be moving about with her injuries. If you find her, please let me know.",""
"55049764-3-523","Verandis trusts you. Hopefully, you now see that not all vampires are evil.",""
"55049764-3-525","If you want my respect, draw some blood in my arena! nnI don't care whether you slaughter your enemy, only that you fight with honor!",""
"55049764-3-526","If you need something, talk to the Constable. Leave me in peace.",""
"55049764-3-528","You've proven very resourceful. As promised, I can help you restore Makana's memory to repay Durak for sharing his Sleepless Potion with me.",""
"55049764-3-529","We have dreamed a nightmare together, and come out alive. I am glad to see you awake, as well.",""
"55049764-3-530","If the wailing keeps up, we may find ourselves without any visitors at all. nnIf I had a choice, I'd leave as well!",""
"55049764-3-533","If you've come to poke fun at the prisoner, you'd better think twice. I'll be out of these stocks soon, and then you'll have to watch your back.nnThey may not have enough evidence to hold me, but that doesn't mean I'm not a dangerous criminal.",""
"55049764-3-536","Did you see her? Wearing the necklace I made? Well, I hope you're happy. This is all your fault.nnNow go away and let me work in peace.",""
"55049764-3-539","So you live, and Lord Montclair does not. Things could not have gone better, I'd say.nnI'm sure your noble house will be glad to hear of Montclair's death, though their strife is far from over.",""
"55049764-3-541","Go as fast as you can, Lieutenant. Until we've tried this, the king won't even talk about surrender.nnWe have to get him to come around before it's too late.",""
"55049764-3-542","Oh no! It's you. Have you come from Hosni? Please. Please have mercy.  nnS'rashi promises to have Hosni's gold soon, but S'rashi cannot get Hosni's gold if he's dead. Tell S'rashi you've not come to kill him.",""
"55049764-3-543","You. You're to go right in.",""
"55049764-3-544","If I see you, I'm supposed to send you in. So I'm sending you in.",""
"55049764-3-546","You've returned, my friend, and you look well! Much better than the last hero I sent to retrieve a wyvern egg.",""
"55049764-3-551","You'll find the ward somewhere inside the Plane Merge, <<1>>.nnBe careful in there. We've already lost a scouting party, and I haven't a clue what got them. I'm sure it's waiting eagerly for more victims.",""
"55049764-3-554","Whoever did this to Mathias needs to pay. Hope you figure out who it was. I bet it was that creepy Altmer, Yarelion. nnI suppose it could have been any of the suitors though.",""
"55049764-3-556","The blue stone is called azurite. It's like her, when she speaks in my head. Her voice is soft. Do you hear it?nnTake my pickaxe. Find the blue stone. Bear caves. North. Near caves. You must.",""
"55049764-3-558","Do you have it? Quickly! I think she's getting worse!",""
"55049764-3-561","We've all been damned by the tragedies at Crestshade. nnI've... come to terms with that.",""
"55049764-3-564","My mistress Azura offers advice that will aid Gavaudon against the Omen of Counting Stars.nnIt can only be defeated in Vaermina's realm of dreams and nightmares.",""
"55049764-3-568","Good luck. You'll need it.",""
"55049764-3-569","One has accomplished what many could not.nnRivenspire can now begin again.",""
"55049764-3-570","I don't know about everyone else but I don't think Borkul is any better of a leader than Godrun.",""
"55049764-3-571","Traveller! Could you offer any aid to <<1>>?",""
"55049764-3-574","Hosni has ruined me! Rebuilding what he's stolen will take years.nnI have no further use for you. Get out of my sight!",""
"55049764-3-578","Have you acquired any samples of tainted flesh?  Any of the those harpies will do.nnThey're right there ... emanating.",""
"55049764-3-579","Go on into the tower and talk to the Hinaults. Reassure them. They're both pretty shaken up.nnBut if Heloise doesn't return soon, I may need to send you out to find her.",""
"55049764-3-582","The Swamp Cypress creaks.",""
"55049764-3-585","We failed to save Crestshade, but perhaps there is hope for Rivenspire.",""
"55049764-3-591","You know, I didn't really think about what I'd do with all these thumbs.nnSay, would you like a necklace?",""
"55049764-3-592","Misfortune hangs over Rivenspire like a dark cloud, friend. And it doesn't help that the city leaders can't agree on which way is up.",""
"55049764-3-593","Travel to the east, into the Bonebarrow, and speak to Golleon. He will need your help.",""
"55049764-3-594","Well, I can hardly believe what I've heard. If this artifact of evil has been destroyed, when will its minions dissipate?nnI know I am too impatient. I do not know how you did this, but the fact that you did is enough of a reason to celebrate.",""
"55049764-3-596","How did those Saproot Shoots work out? I bet you made a right mess for those ugly Imperials.",""
"55049764-3-598","Take that charm I gave you to Priestess Fleile.nnShe's in Razorvine Refuge, north of here. nnTell her of your success. She will be pleased.",""
"55049764-3-599","I'm not sure I can stand much more of this. The bodies … the blood ….nnI wanted to save this family, but look what happened. It feels like everything has suddenly gone wrong.",""
"55049764-3-603","If I could trade my life to bring back my dear Lakana, I would. Moving on will not be easy, but I must honor her sacrifice by doing all that I can to protect the Covenant.nnI will speak with King Fahara'jad. Perhaps we can come together in mourning.",""
"55049764-3-606","What did you find? Did she take anything else from the Barrows?",""
"55049764-3-607","Go on, take a good look around. Don't be shy, my dear. I certainly won't be! I have nothing to hide.",""
"55049764-3-612","If Alcaire is truly threatened, regardless of where it comes from, I will defend it to the death.",""

"55049764-3-2789","Do you have the reagents?",""
"55049764-3-2790","Go to the Oortel River, east of Ten-Maur-Wolk. The Nagas must be gathering the barrels of pitch from the banks even now.nnGather some yourself, and use it against them.",""

"55049764-3-2797","Still your tongue and lower your head. The dead can hear and see as well as the living. If either does there will be no escape.nnI must find out what these dryskins want with my people.",""
"55049764-3-2798","There are many heroes buried here, to be sure, but these three are the ones Ash'abah scholars are most concerned about. nnThey were extremely powerful in life, and scholars fear they could be extremely dangerous in death.",""
"55049764-3-2808","Hopefully, it won't take too long. I've deciphered many runes since I joined the Mages Guild. I like to think of it as a specialty.",""

"55049764-3-2882","Aww, the Mudcrab's gone cold!nnPerhaps you should try a different route in delivering these if that one's not working out for you?nnHere, take some more and try to be quick about it.",""
"55049764-3-2888","Assaulting this foe will require precision.nn<<1>> is one of our best. He should have returned by now.",""

"55049764-3-2898","Though they are mad and attack you without warning, don't be angry with the Lost ones. They hatched with the soul of an Argonian but the mind of a savage beast. nnBring them mercy.",""
"55049764-3-2899","Excellent! <<1>> will be eager to speak with you.",""
"55049764-3-2904","Thank you again for retrieving my dishes. Once they've had a nice soak, and we're back on speaking terms, I hope they'll be more compliant. Please feel free to visit us anytime! You'll always be welcome here.",""

"55049764-3-2909","That will help. Your chopping and mine. Just keep all the noise down. Too much squealing.nnThe Archeins set up their camp in the north area of the Mire. They must have left behind something that could show us how to seal the vents.",""

"55049764-3-2913","<<1>> has accepted you among us. That's good enough for me.",""
"55049764-3-2914","Some lights remain, but I know better than to listen to them.nnWait. They may come after me now. I know too much.nnI need to barricade the door. Please step outside.",""

"55049764-3-2942","It is done? I fear time is against us.",""
"55049764-3-2943","This sword came from the new armaments you brought in. My old one was pitted and rusty. It likely would not have held up in a real fight.",""
"55049764-3-2944","I'm glad the skirmishers and maulers received new equipment. I'll be standing behind them should we ever get into a real conflict.",""

"55049764-3-3002","Living with a harpy? nnTava bless her.",""
"55049764-3-3005","Make sure those reports get into the hands of the Archeins. As long as the Archeins and Wardens are focused on each other, they aren't paying attention to us.",""

"55049764-3-3022","Your arrival is timely indeed. I'm glad my scout was able to find you. Destane was injured fighting the ogres who were carrying off the prisoners so we took shelter here to recover.nnWe need to find medicine for him as soon as possible.",""

"55049764-3-3451","I assumed that horn was a signal when I saw the nobles run out. Good thinking.",""
"55049764-3-3456","Look for the roots of the Wyrd around the mill.nnRemember that those creatures must give up their lives near the roots or the roots won't absorb their life essences. Any creature you kill away from a root is a life extinguished for no reason.",""

"55049764-3-3479","The generals of the Alessian army played a vital part in the Battle of the Glenumbra Moors. Their weapons, if still intact, would suffice, I think.nnIf you manage to get your hands on the weapons, find Sarvith. He knows what to do from there.",""
"55049764-3-3482","Try not to judge the Daggers on what you've seen so far. We're a good group and we mean well.nnNow, enough talking. Let's go hit something!",""

"55049764-3-4583","My crystal tells me you have done my terrible deed.",""

"55049764-3-4595","I can't stay here!",""
"55049764-3-4599","Thank you for getting me out of that mine. My husband and I are indebted to you. Once things calm down here, I'll get you that mead I promised.nnAnd it'll be good stuff from Hodmar's private stock, assuming the Goblins haven't stolen it.",""
"55049764-3-4604","If you hurry, you may be able to take <<1>> by surprise. Any advantage we can get at this point is worth it.",""
"55049764-3-4614","There's only one more trial. We'll let you know once we're finished delving through Sheogorath's madness.",""
"55049764-3-4615","And the cycle of pain continues. I hope you're proud of your part in this tragedy.",""
"55049764-3-4616","How can I assist the hero of <<1>>?",""
"55049764-3-4617","Do you have it? Did you find the keystone?",""
"55049764-3-4619","I can see Wood Elves out there, but why?nnWe have nothing here that could possibly interest them.",""
"55049764-3-4621","My brother and I came here together to join the Companions, and I'll be damned if we're not leaving here together, but he's caught in the mine. Please, look for <<1>>, you must save him.",""
"55049764-3-4625","Excuse me. The keeper expects us to maintain this area without distraction.",""
"55049764-3-4627","I can't believe you actually sided with that coward.nnGo die in a hole, Goblin-lover. The Pact doesn't need any more snowbacks like you.",""

"55049764-3-4632","They're everywhere! I don't know where they came from. I didn't see them until I grabbed a bucket to douse the flames, and then it attacked me. A Daedra!nnMy fortunes have never looked less pleasing.",""
"55049764-3-4633","We now pause for a brief intermission. Would you like some cheese?",""
"55049764-3-4634","Did you find them? Did you find the Eyes? Let's get this door open!",""
"55049764-3-4635","You've saved us all, but the giants are gathering on the hill. The Worm Cult must have angered them. I just hope there isn't a stampede.",""

"55049764-3-4637","They keep trophies every time they kill an invader. That drum in the treasure pile should get the chieftain's attention.",""

"55049764-3-4646","Well. Glad to see someone who can get things done. Good work.",""
"55049764-3-4650","I wish we'd never come here, but <<1>> insisted we'd find a way to fit in.",""

"55049764-3-4658","I need to get the wounded back to the tower. Gut the bastards and climb their corpses to the signal fire.",""
"55049764-3-4661","It's done. My students return to the Hist.",""
"55049764-3-4662","Thank the Eight! You're not a Daedra.nnYou shouldn't sneak up on folks like that!",""
"55049764-3-4664","Follow the trail I left when I made my escape. You'll know his lair by the bones, blood, and smell.nnTempt him with some game, and I bet you'll get his attention.",""
"55049764-3-4666","Orkey's Hollow is north of the village. Send everyone you find back here. Good luck.",""
"55049764-3-4667","Praise Sithis! A traveler! Please, the poison's chill is getting to me. I don't know if I'm going to make it.",""

"55049764-3-4707","Greetings, Vestige. Sai is recovering well enough, though he hides a great pain in his heart. His confinement has shaken him more than he dares admit.",""

"55049764-3-4855","Master Eveline and I will be waiting at the base of the root system.",""
"55049764-3-4856","Well. You got his attention. I can feel his energies shifting. He's angry.",""
"55049764-3-4857","Fascinating. The roots do not consume you. That may prove useful.",""
"55049764-3-4859","You brought an Imperial here? What for? I ought to crush his skull right now!",""
"55049764-3-4860","What news? Have you found my daughter?",""
"55049764-3-4861","I really enjoy these impromptu celebrations!",""
"55049764-3-4863","I need to figure out what happened here. My friends deserve answers.",""
"55049764-3-4867","You saved the lives of the hunters. You ruined their clothes, but you saved their lives.nnMy father will be upset when his slaves fail to locate new prey. He'll become curious. Then we'll catch him off-guard.",""
"55049764-3-4872","You gave the orb to my sister? nnI hope you had a good reason.",""
"55049764-3-4880","I can't believe all this happened. Because of a thief and an enchanted lute.",""
"55049764-3-4884","Thanks for coming to get me.",""
"55049764-3-4886","You follow me to my home? I should bite your feet off, and see how well you run!nnThe Hound is my consort. He has shown me the way of the wilds, and we rule over the forest, together. I need nothing from you!",""
"55049764-3-4889","With your help, I just know we're going to succeed!",""
"55049764-3-4890","Goat stew! You have to use a spoon or a fork to eat it. What kind of meal is that?",""
"55049764-3-4893","I'd love to travel to Alik'r and try their exotic spices.",""
"55049764-3-4894","We're fortunate no one has perished, but I fear my Keepers have grown desperate and cowardly. Did you hear Voranil's remark? Use Daedric power? Sacrilegious.nnWe need to get Rilis back in his prison before my Keepers do something they'll regret.",""
"55049764-3-4895","Holed up in a cave. Good to hear she's still up and kicking!",""
"55049764-3-4897","Greetings in his name. I've never been to Orsinium but I hear it's … nice. We're always pleased to have new faces join us.",""
"55049764-3-4898","Ah, the smell of fresh blood. It's intoxicating. I only wish I had been the one to drain the life from their bodies.nnBut this is not about me. This is about sending a message. And Valeric has heard it, loud and clear.",""
"55049764-3-4900","I miss my friends. I don't know if we will ever feel safe in Cragwallow again.",""
"55049764-3-4902","Things are quiet here. For now.",""
"55049764-3-4904","If the spirit of the former Green Lady is appearing to you, you should find out what she wants.",""
"55049764-3-4907","I'm afraid this is only the beginning. I burn with eagerness to eradicate our enemies.",""
"55049764-3-4911","The Ternion Monks have helped you and the Skald-King. Maybe now people will understand that we are not the monsters they thought us to be.",""
"55049764-3-4913","I'm sure we'll run into each other again. Maybe even when we have a show to perform!",""
"55049764-3-4914","Don't get yourself killed, now!",""
"55049764-3-4915","Come no closer until you've stated your business.",""
"55049764-3-4916","That was no trick. That was Sai Sahan!",""
"55049764-3-4919","It's always good to see you, brave one.",""
"55049764-3-4920","I'm sure Irnskar has other errands for you to run.",""
"55049764-3-4921","Lucky shot from one of those Sea Vipers. Looks like I'll have to postpone those dancing lessons.nnDid you find the sky-key?",""
"55049764-3-4924","King Jorunn stirs in agony before he calms and grows still. These waves repeat, even as you enter his dreams.nnHis life continues to slip away. What did you discover?",""
"55049764-3-4926","Once you rescue the Silvenar, you'll need a warrior's help to get him out of Jathsogur. All the advice I can give you won't make up for a strong sword at your side.",""
"55049764-3-4927","One more wounded warrior won't make a difference. Good advice is what you need on the road out of Jathsogur. Sacrifice me and Sariel can help you after you save the Silvenar.",""
"55049764-3-4931","I'll be along shortly. I'm not feeling … well.",""
"55049764-3-4933","Free of this accursed tomb and those thrice-damned cultists! I owe you a debt. Perhaps someday I'll repay it.",""
"55049764-3-4936","There are few who can claim to have fought against the Worm Cult and survived, let alone prevailed. nnI wonder if you might be convinced to strike another blow against them. The Skald-King could use someone like you at Honrich Tower.",""
"55049764-3-4938","We've got trouble here. The Reachmen have taken over the Northwind Mine up ahead.",""
"55049764-3-4939","Did I hear that right? The hero of Eastmarch? Well met, and good to have you with us!",""
"55049764-3-4941","Were you sent to rescue us?",""
"55049764-3-4942","The Stormfists were panicked by the raging fires. We cut through their ranks as quickly as we could, but I'm afraid we were too late.nnTell me … my sister …?",""
"55049764-3-4946","It's good to finally see you with my own eyes. Thank you for rescuing me, but our trials are not over.nnThe binding stones affected my connection to the Bosmer. I must get back everything they took from me.",""
"55049764-3-4948","Spinners don't usually write their tales down. I guess since this valley's been fought over many times, they wanted to keep their tales from fading. We're lucky these journals exist!",""
"55049764-3-4950","Help Firras find the end of his tale. Not with wind and rain, but with pain and death!",""
"55049764-3-4951","The brewery's up the hill. Follow your nose, you can't miss the smell of fermenting rotmeth.nnI'll stay here and tend to <<1>>.",""
"55049764-3-4955","Thallik is just down the hall. Hakra and I have your back.",""
"55049764-3-4956","The spirits of Ysgramor's companions will ride with you against the Worms!nnTalk to Valdur before you go. And Kyne's speed, my friend!",""
"55049764-3-4959","Help! Everything is horrible forever!",""
"55049764-3-4964","I'm glad you're the one who brings us the Handfast, after all you've done.",""
"55049764-3-4965","Over here, friend. How did you fare?",""
"55049764-3-4966","The Silvenar believes you are a friend. Frankly, I think you're a blessed hero.nnY'ffre knows we need one now.",""
"55049764-3-4970","I am so relieved that Jomund is safe. Thank you for helping.",""
"55049764-3-4972","At long last! Long live the Silvenar and the Green Lady!",""
"55049764-3-4975","A simple ceremony starts the Bosmers' most important relationship.",""
"55049764-3-4976","Be careful. Something's not right, here.",""
"55049764-3-4981","The Green Lady and the Silvenar will always be in your debt. As will the spinners of this city.",""
"55049764-3-4982","I'll meet up with the rest of the crew once my tasks are complete.",""
"55049764-3-4985","We caught this Maormer exiting the hold, likely off to warn his masters. With a bit of coaxing, he gave us the information we need.",""
"55049764-3-4988","You'll probably find Lord Vurlop in the inn. Like most Nords, he enjoys his mead. And I understand that nobles can get particularly thirsty when the King is in town.",""
"55049764-3-4991","You! What are you doing here? Let me guess. You're helping Rigurt again, aren't you?",""
"55049764-3-4992","The Prince and his hot temper! He decided to hold his own meeting while the King and the Pact ambassadors meet at the keep.nnHe managed to insult both the Dark Elves and the Argonians with his posturing and boastfulness!",""
"55049764-3-4995","This is your chance. Prove your legacy.",""
"55049764-3-4996","If you're going to wander the city, might as well start on the east side of town. The homeless there tend to complain louder than the others.",""
"55049764-3-4997","It's like a veil's been removed from my eyes. No, from all my senses!nnEver since becoming the Green Lady, I've felt the power of the Bosmer, but now I sense their spirit as well.",""
"55049764-3-5000","I can't wait to hear the bard sing. I wonder if he gives private performances?",""
"55049764-3-5001","You win, outsider. We'll return to the surface.",""
"55049764-3-5004","The King's Arrow! Well met.",""
"55049764-3-5009","Just go. I'll be fine.",""
"55049764-3-5010","Sai Sahan is back with you. I've lived up to my part of the deal—I trust that the rest of you will do the same.",""
"55049764-3-5013","I need to get an idea of how much damage they've done.",""
"55049764-3-5017","What a mess. We'll be eating omelets tonight, I can tell you.",""
"55049764-3-5019","I think I figured out why cats like us so much.nnIt's because we are so beautiful. And we smell good.",""
"55049764-3-5020","Do you know what that s'wit had me fetch while you were gone? Food from the other tent! As if walking ten feet would kill him.nnI got the food, though. Added a special berry, too. His stomach will appreciate it.",""
"55049764-3-5026","Under the table, just there! Did you see that? It was a Worm Cultist!",""
"55049764-3-5027","You're giving me an odd look, stranger. I'm not sure I like it. Didn't I tell you to move on? Must I have you escorted out of my Thane's keep?",""
"55049764-3-5028","I don't trust you. Hallfrida looks disgusted. No doubt you've done something.",""
"55049764-3-5029","I overheard your conversation with the thane. Let me know immediately if her advisors find anything.",""
"55049764-3-5032","Good, good. Need to hold the line here. Can't let the Captain down, yeah?",""
"55049764-3-5033","Thank you.nnOh, and when you meet whoever's responsible for this … twist the knife a little? Just for me.",""
"55049764-3-5034","Help Imiril. Rilis has a twisted fascination with her.nnI'd wager she's alive, though I doubt she's enjoying herself.",""
"55049764-3-5036","The Three smile on me today. My silk sits again in my stores, and Turil must wallow in his misery.",""
"55049764-3-5037","You gave away my silk to that … that netch. Does it bring you joy to steal from an old Dark Elf?",""
"55049764-3-5041","Thorulf's room is on the first floor of the manor, on the eastern side. Sirkidur has a skeleton key, but I'm not sure how to get it from her.",""
"55049764-3-5044","Thanks for meeting me here. Please stay until I'm officially a sage. It means a lot to me.",""
"55049764-3-5046","<<1>> is with you? Can I see her?",""
"55049764-3-5049","<<1>> researched this ruin for a reason. The river has brought us here.nnWe must explore until we've uncovered her purpose or died with a blade in our skulls.",""
"55049764-3-5050","You don't look infected. I guess you're all right.",""
"55049764-3-5051","Come now. Aren't you two done in there yet? Aelif is not sure why Merric is so green with envy. nnShe was more than happy to see you accompany the guildmaster into the portal.",""
"55049764-3-5052","Who knows what <<1>> thought she was after? What clawless fool records her plan in a journal?nnAelif would like to point out that the Dwarves believed in nothing. What would they know of Molag Bal's plot?",""
"55049764-3-5053","Comrade, I'm glad you're going with <<1>>. Her passion to discover Doshia's goal is all-consuming. I fear it will cloud her judgement. nnStendarr watch over you both.",""
"55049764-3-5054","Well, at least they're all accounted for. No more dares for me.",""
"55049764-3-5058","You! Thank Kyne. You want to do something about these ropes?",""
"55049764-3-5059","Thank Kyne! A familiar face. How did you know to come here, my friend?",""
"55049764-3-5060","I hope you're up to the task. Some of my best warriors have fallen attempting to push out those cultists.",""
"55049764-3-5061","I'm going to make it. I am! I'll live to see Riften and hoist a pint. Thank you, my friend.",""
"55049764-3-5062","<<1>> won't be safe until Treehenge is secure.",""
"55049764-3-5063","Do what you must to save <<1>>.",""
"55049764-3-5064","Why must the Worm Cult meddle in Bosmer affairs?",""
"55049764-3-5065","I'm getting stronger every minute. I wonder what my sprout will look like?",""
"55049764-3-5069","Continue your journey, wherever your path leads.nnWe'll contact you once we know more about these recent events.",""
"55049764-3-5070","Do not linger here. Danger threatens elsewhere.",""
"55049764-3-5072","A new face? What brings you to this godsforsaken place?",""
"55049764-3-5080","I'm sure with a little coaxing <<1>> will get the job done. He's far from the best performer on the island. But at least he's awake.",""
"55049764-3-5081","This one has business to take care of. Aelif has her suspicions.",""
"55049764-3-5082","You should speak with the guildmaster. You're just in time for another important mission.",""
"55049764-3-5083","I need to get my daggers.",""
"55049764-3-5087","I'll wait here for you. I don't trust the Mad God enough to approach his shrine.",""
"55049764-3-5088","Look who's returned to us, <<1>>! nnWell now, how did you like my candidates? Splendid specimens, aren't they?",""
"55049764-3-5089","Find the book in Sheogorath's realm.",""
"55049764-3-5091","Did you see them? They're plotting, scheming, perparing. But they won't get it. They mustn't.",""
"55049764-3-5096","I hope you can help Merric at-Aswala with whatever it is he needs.",""
"55049764-3-5101","There's only one more trial. We'll let you know once we're finished delving through Sheogorath's madness.",""
"55049764-3-5105","Go, investigate Betar-Nes's home. I don't trust these locals to do a thorough search. You, I can trust.",""
"55049764-3-5108","I hope the Worm Cult has been shattered. But I fear they are just the foot of the mountain.",""
"55049764-3-5109","Hero, huh? Good luck in the mines. The Reach are bloody-minded bastards.",""
"55049764-3-5110","Place the <<mz:1>> in the final two sconces so we can enter the shrine.",""
"55049764-3-5111","I have great news for you, Adept!",""
"55049764-3-5115","I am the Watcher at the Bridge. I guard the border between this world and Sovngarde.",""

"55049764-3-5117","Thank the Three, you're not a Daedra. You shouldn't sneak up on folks like that!",""
"55049764-3-5118","Well, that was easy, eh? It gets harder from here.",""
"55049764-3-5119","Like a spring torrent, our troops will pour through the pass you've opened.",""
"55049764-3-5120","The braziers I've prepared will harness the power of the shards of Wuuthrad. Gather all that you can.nnWhen I give the word, activate the brazier to unleash the power of each shard.",""
"55049764-3-5121","You have to get out of here!",""
"55049764-3-5124","Welcome back, adept. We're ready to take control of the island from Sheogorath.",""
"55049764-3-5127","That was well done. I'm sure the Wood Orcs will be back, but now we have a foothold on this side of the bridge.nnWe'll need to keep fighting, if we want to hold it.",""
"55049764-3-5128","You've done it! By the gods, the lieutenant would be proud.nnWe've killed or rounded up most of the Ra Gada invaders. The militia won't have a problem with them anymore!",""
"55049764-3-5129","Remember to keep an eye out, just in case.",""
"55049764-3-5131","Good to see you again.",""
"55049764-3-5135","The mercenaries of the Gold Coast drink our wine and eat our food. They are waiting. For what, we must find out.nnI've heard of a courier's arrival within the hour. I need his message before it gets into the hands of the Gold Coast.",""
"55049764-3-5136","I'll do whatever the lieutenant says, so long as Velyn Harbor is saved.",""
"55049764-3-5140","Our worst nightmare has come to life. Sinmur has returned. The ancient enemy of the Companions must be faced once more.",""
"55049764-3-5141","Have you ever thought of becoming a brewer's assistant? We could go after even more unusual ingredients.",""
"55049764-3-5145","Ready?",""
"55049764-3-5147","I will seek out these monks once I make sure everything here is all right.nnI will see you soon.",""
"55049764-3-5160","Don't bother … with a whole tree. Just gather kindling. Plenty of branches down.",""
"55049764-3-5162","Best-case scenario? They've found the Mora. I don't want to think about the worst-case. Too many variables.",""
"55049764-3-5163","Be careful.",""
"55049764-3-5165","I've never seen the <<1>> look like this before. It's wonderful!",""
"55049764-3-5171","Are you the one the sergeant spoke of? She's very complimentary. I'm sure she'd like to talk to you again.",""
"55049764-3-5172","What the …? What just happened?",""
"55049764-3-5173","Someone finally shut that lizard up. Great work out there, and some mighty fine shooting.",""
"55049764-3-5175","The Maormer around the lighthouse should have a rune that opens the barrier on the lighthouse's front door. Shake a few of those beach lizards down. I'm sure the rune will fall out.",""
"55049764-3-5176","You made it, and in one piece too. I thought my leg was going to give out crossing the water.nnBut enough of that. Did you locate my things?",""
"55049764-3-5183","You should find the Black Dagger camp west of here. Please recover our claw!",""
"55049764-3-5184","Go carefully on the roads, my friend. You're a valuable resource to the Dominion. nnAnd me, of course.",""
"55049764-3-5185","You've returned. And with the spell-lattice?",""
"55049764-3-5187","Another blade for the fight, eh? Are there lots more behind you?",""
"55049764-3-5189","<<1>> has a keen mind and a good heart. She's the key to freeing Ezduiin.",""

"55049764-3-5221","Kyne speed you—and if you run into any Worm Cultists, squash a few for me!",""
"55049764-3-5224","The spirits won't be appeased without a sacrifice of some kind.nnI don't believe they'll want a life for a life, but one must never be too careful.",""

"55049764-3-5477","So what have you heard?",""
"55049764-3-5478","Raz must admit. Even he did not think we'd be seeing each other again so soon. How are you, my friend?",""
"55049764-3-5479","Please don't tell Harnald how much you did here. He'll never give me another mission if you do!",""
"55049764-3-5481","<The log sits empty, for now>",""

"55049764-3-5509","Yeah, lots of nice stuff here. I'll just look around while you go find those blades.",""
"55049764-3-5515","I think me and my boy can handle the rest of the chores. nnTruth to tell, I don't think you're cut out for farm work.",""
"55049764-3-5517","Thank Auri-El, a friendly face. You're Raz's cohort, aren't you?",""
"55049764-3-5519","I think the tomb is somewhere within these ice caves.",""

"55049764-3-5535","Glad you could make it! Talk to Mom, she'll tell you what you need to know.",""
"55049764-3-5536","The King and his parties. Today, three sloppy drunkards wandered into the crypts and haven't been heard from since. nnI'll wager a week's pay they'll unleash something unspeakable down here, and I'll get blamed. They always blame the priest.",""
"55049764-3-5537","Kill the matriarch and this all ends.",""
"55049764-3-5538","Could it be I made the wrong decision?",""

"55049764-3-5553","Hmm? Have you had a chance to look around yet?",""
"55049764-3-5554","I've almost recovered enough magicka to assume my disguise. By the time you rescue the Bosmer captives, I'll be ready to go.",""

"55049764-3-5625","I had a feeling the truth would be bad. nnIt's a good thing Urcelmo took a small force with him on ahead. I'd hate for the Queen to have reached the city first. But Rilis. We'll need to warn him.",""

"55049764-3-6329","Traveler! A moment if you please. I'm an … associate of Cariel's. Would you have a moment to assist me? My horse startled as we crossed the bridge, and I lost some important cargo over the side.",""
"55049764-3-6332","Three servants reunited to their master. Only one remains.",""
"55049764-3-6335","Well … that hurt ….",""
"55049764-3-6336","Move on down the river, friend. I'm mulling my next wager. There is much profit to be made at the arena!",""
"55049764-3-6337","If what Razum-dar says is true, the city of Woodhearth owes you a debt. Of course, if the city's attacked and destroyed, that won't be worth much. Maybe we can prevent that.nnThe cat said you found orders from Vicereeve Pelidil. Can I see them?",""
"55049764-3-6339","If you're leaving soon, I'd like to ask a favor of you.",""
"55049764-3-6340","If you are fortunate enough to actually speak to the Wilderking, I suggest you keep the conversation to yourself.nnOtherwise, people might think your brain's turned to peat moss.",""
"55049764-3-6342","I'm glad you're here. We were worried we'd missed our opportunity. The other scouts report that Fildgor's flank is undefended.",""

"55049764-3-6353","Who's there? I didn't kill your Dominion friends. I warned them, but they didn't listen.",""
"55049764-3-6362","Beat three of my hunters in duels and my axe is yours.",""
"55049764-3-6363","I wonder if you know how completely we are in your debt? Alik'r warriors fear no evil, but they will not fight the undead.nnIt may be a superstition, but it has been tradition for centuries. I could not have convinced my guards to break it today.",""
"55049764-3-6364","By the Eight, you've got one of the skulls! And you don't appear to have fallen under the spell …. nnLet me see it. Please!",""

"55049764-3-6372","Something's wrong. He smells … very dead.",""
"55049764-3-6374","Not another one. Where does Garnikh find you suckers?",""
"55049764-3-6375","Yeah? I don't have all day.",""
"55049764-3-6376","We should head up to the gates to the keep. It won't hurt to check in on the King, though I doubt anyone without a key could get past those gates.",""
"55049764-3-6378","My hope is that Prince Azah might have a lead on where Uwafa and Alasan have set up their headquarters, or better yet, what they're planning next.nnRegardless, these are things we should discuss at the palace.",""
"55049764-3-6382","Those supply caches are the runners' only chance to reach help. We must get them stocked!",""
"55049764-3-6392","I know that many aren't happy you kept the relic, but you made the right decision.nnIf you're ever in trouble, you can call on my blade. I hope we get the chance to sail together again, my friend.",""

"55049764-3-6395","Sithis? Here? That can't be ….",""
"55049764-3-6397","Hallowed, I can see the light of the Dance reflected in your eyes. Jone and Jode smile down upon you now. They are with you, at this difficult hour. You must choose.",""
"55049764-3-6408","As you've just seen, the young girl—Aranias—is associated with the Veiled Heritance. Until I know more about her, I hesitate to call her an enemy.nnI will have more insight soon though. Even now, Aranias is on her way to my throne.",""
"55049764-3-6409","I heard what she said. She's a good friend, Bowenas. Must be very hard for her.",""
"55049764-3-6410","What I propose is simple. A kind of limited partnership. Kill <<1>> and walk out of here with that boy Tand.",""
"55049764-3-6412","My life mate must have been sick with worry. I never thought I would see Sind again. This one doesn't deserve him.",""
"55049764-3-6413","This one begs your indulgence. He wonders if you have seen a flaxon-furred Khajiit with a braided mane in your travels?",""
"55049764-3-6414","Well met, friend. I don't suppose you have seen a male Khajiit wandering about? He has mane-braids like mine, and a foolish tendancy to gamble until his pockets are empty.",""
"55049764-3-6415","I can see the benevolence of S'rendarr in your eyes. Thank you.",""
"55049764-3-6421","Let's see how tough your guardian is. Go to the stumps to pit your guardian against the others. You can use the stone to heals yours if you like.",""
"55049764-3-6422","So you commanded the general to turn around and fight on our behalf instead?nnI feel sorry for the spirits of his soldiers that they remain bound here, but at least you were able to free the villagers from the Shadow Wood.",""
"55049764-3-6423","You've returned! nnI hope you have fared better in your travels than I. For a moment I imagined you were a Daedric illusion. Rilis and his Daedric thrall have been a menace to me.",""
"55049764-3-6424","The hero of the caravan returns! Are you in for the next race? We have many fine and juicy lizards!",""
"55049764-3-6429","Ah, freedom at long last! My calculations suggested that you had a slightly better chance to fail rather than to succeed. I suspect, though, that you often beat the odds. Thank you.",""
"55049764-3-6436","Ah, look around you. See how the people brighten the streets with their very presence! It is good to have this place inhabited once again.",""
"55049764-3-6437","Admit it. You cannot resist the lure of the spikeball!",""
"55049764-3-6440","Find out what he wants. We need to get out of here!",""
"55049764-3-6441","This isn't going to be a happy reunion, but don't worry — I won't overstep my bounds.",""
"55049764-3-6442","There you are! Quick as you please. There's even time for tea.",""
"55049764-3-6444","With the Elder Scroll of Mnem in our hands once again, the Dominion is greatly strengthened.",""
"55049764-3-6445","Go. Go and find whoever did this to her. They must pay.",""
"55049764-3-6447","I hope that helmet does the trick. If that doesn't put her in a more reasonable state of mind, we may have to turn to a more forceful solution.",""
"55049764-3-6448","Ezreba awaits judgment. This one is ready to face the consequences of her actions. She hopes that mercy remains in the hearts of her neighbors.",""

"55049764-3-6452","The Shadowscales aren't currently providing gifts, but speak ill of us we'll gift you with a thrashing.",""
"55049764-3-6453","I was very proud of this meal, too. Damned cultists.",""
"55049764-3-6455","Dancing elves, forest spirit kings … these people are pulling on the tail in more ways than one.nnYou can stay if you want to, but Hazazi thinks it is time for him to return to Marbruk.",""
"55049764-3-6456","You have better things to do than spend time talking to me, outsider.",""
"55049764-3-6457","Is that Captain Arakh's helmet? Well, return it to her already! She's about to rush us!",""
"55049764-3-6458","Our hero honors this humble arena! These troll fights are nothing compared to your fearsome battle with the great <<1>>. This one has already heard several tavern songs about it.",""

"55049764-3-6523","I know going against Kaleen was a hard thing. It was for me as well. We have more history together than you can imagine.nnEven so, I'm leaving. It's time to start my own crew, sail my own ship. You, my friend, would be welcome with us anytime.",""
"55049764-3-6526","I wish I could have retrieved that Ayleid relic for study, but you were wise to destroy it rather that place it in Breton hands.nnI realize Kaleen disagrees with your decision, but never doubt it was the right one.",""
"55049764-3-6528","I know the others have doubts, but that's their problem.nnIf Captain Kaleen believes the power of that relic can be used for good, I do too. You did the right thing! When I see my brothers again, I'll tell them what you did for them.",""
"55049764-3-6535","By destroying the relic, you have saved the world from a great evil. Kasan's apprentice does not agree, but she has lost her way. This one can only hope she one day returns to the true path.nnGo safely, friend.",""

"55049764-3-6586","My favorite traveler! The forest keep and protect you on your path.",""
"55049764-3-6590","Killing <<c:1>> was foolish. <<A:2>> and <<c:1>> shared a lifebond. She has little time to avenge him before she too will die, and <<c:2>> is a most dangerous creature.nnBut then, you have that spring in your stride again. What have you learned?",""
"55049764-3-6591","You recovered our eggs! How wonderful! My people will be most grateful to you for this.",""

"55049764-3-6798","What I wouldn't give to be having this meeting in Skyrim. It's hot as dragon's breath in here.",""
"55049764-3-6800","If anyone can get to the bottom of this, it's you and Aelif. She's gone up to the roof of the Hall to get some air. Stendarr guard your steps, my friend.",""
"55049764-3-6804","I cannot believe we are still standing here! nnPlease, talk to Enneh and then let me know what he says. If he doesn't know where Casnar is, then we can call the wedding off!",""
"55049764-3-6805","This path is over, but the journey never ends. May the moons shine brightly on you in the future.",""
"55049764-3-6806","By the shining trees of Aldmeris. We have been burgled, but how?",""
"55049764-3-6807","Shh. Keep one good ear to the ground, always.",""
"55049764-3-6808","Hazazi never thought he would miss the dancing Bosmer.",""
"55049764-3-6810","Oh! Ah … greetings, traveler. What can I do for you?",""
"55049764-3-6811","What have you learned of my old friend, <<1>>?",""
"55049764-3-6814","Thank the gods you're here!",""
"55049764-3-6815","By the forest itself, I'm saved! Thank you. Did Nethrin send you?",""
"55049764-3-6816","The portal. It's unsealed? Praise the Divines. And Galandir? Is he all right?",""
"55049764-3-6817","Looks like we only meet in horrible places! Did you bring the hundred blades this time?nnNo matter. You didn't need them in Firsthold.",""
"55049764-3-6818","I've seen no sign of a forest spirit so far, ancient or otherwise. But there is, indeed, a powerful aura about this place.",""
"55049764-3-6820","I wasn't expecting open war out here, but that's what that was. Patraud never had a chance.nnI don't know what the Warlock has gotten us into, but I'll die fighting if I have to. I'm Redguard before I'm a Mage.",""
"55049764-3-6821","Warlock Carindon may trust you, but that doesn't mean I do. I've no desire to have my fate dictated by the likes of you.",""
"55049764-3-6822","This is difficult to behold, but if it saves another mage from harm, then I'll abide it.",""
"55049764-3-6824","The price of knowledge is always high, but I don't like the feel of this place. Mayhem awaits us, I think.",""
"55049764-3-6826","Don't worry, I'm not dead yet. Go on. I'll see you around.",""
"55049764-3-6830","Remember, only the best and most delectable bones for I.",""
"55049764-3-6831","This continued aggression from the Bosmer is distressing. With two mages lost already, we'll need to be careful. My fallen colleagues will not be forgotten.nnNo doubt our elusive forest spirit is nearby.",""
"55049764-3-6832","How dare you enter our gathering hall, you Crown dog! Go back to your own kennel for jackals!",""
"55049764-3-6833","You have a senche-tiger's heart coming here, Crown. But the bravery of a beast is rooted in folly. Leave now.",""
"55049764-3-6834","Forebear dog! Do not sully our carpets with your faithless heels. Leave now.",""
"55049764-3-6835","I'll … I'll see you back in Rawl'kha. Go … go now. Save Lorwen!",""
"55049764-3-6836","Welcome—it's good to have you come with us. You will not find that cup of fellowship in that Forebear Magistrate's hall.",""
"55049764-3-6842","I… I feel like I've been through this before. Thanks for helping me. I couldn't have fought them off alone.nnLet's get back to the manor. I'm getting hungry.",""
"55049764-3-6843","Those are the items I seek! Give them to me, and I will learn their place in the story of my people.",""
"55049764-3-6847","I believe it's best to destroy the focuses first. Alasan's minions have been piling the dead around them, and they seem to be channeling energy for the ritual.nnDestroy the focuses; then go to the lighthouse and find a way to disrupt Alasan's ritual.",""
"55049764-3-6858","Ah good … you're here. Razum-dar was afraid he would have to bleed to death by himself.",""
"55049764-3-6870","Send another score and I will smite them just the same! I could cut down Sea Vipers all day long!nnWell done, my friend! We'll have the sanctuary back under control quickly now, but we can't stop here. The battle's only just begun!",""
"55049764-3-6876","My soul! They've taken my soul!",""
"55049764-3-6885","I'm glad there are a few of us left who know the meaning of courage and loyalty! You'd make High King Emeric proud.nnLook on the decks of the three ships. The designs should be there … unless they've already been stolen!",""
"55049764-3-6887","Her body must be consecrated, or the gods will know her not.",""
"55049764-3-6898","Have a seat by the fire and let me know when you're ready to hear the story. Remember, ask nicely.",""
"55049764-3-6903","Hurry up. I ain't getting any younger.",""
"55049764-3-6919","You have returned! This one hopes the visions were not too intense. Raz has heard stories.",""
"55049764-3-6923","It's good to finally meet you. I'm very happy we could be here to support Akkhuz-ri and the Champions. This is a vulnerable moment for our fragile new Dominion.",""
"55049764-3-6926","Good luck in there.",""
"55049764-3-6927","I have heard of your valor, though we have not met before. My Silvenar and I are well pleased that we could be here to support the Khajiiti people.",""
"55049764-3-6928","Green keep you. This is my first time on the borderlands of Valenwood. And my first time in a Khajiiti temple! I'm honored to be here today.",""
"55049764-3-6931","The path never ends, my friend. We must always walk forward and pray that the moons will guide us to where we should go. Now I must rebuild this city and my people. Restore the physical body of the Khajiit and the spiritual body of my people.",""
"55049764-3-6939","Some things are best left undisturbed.",""
"55049764-3-6949","Hey there mortal! How you doing?",""
"55049764-3-6952","The story now approaches its conclusion. There will be a reckoning for Aranias and for the Wilderking himself.nnYou must hasten to Greenheart, for you still have a key role to play.",""
"55049764-3-6953","If the Eldest has been corrupted, then everything in this area—every plant, every creature, and every person will soon become corrupted as well.nnI can't imagine how this blight can so easily penetrate the forest's protections.",""
"55049764-3-6954","Nnnn! It's … just barely holding together!",""
"55049764-3-6955","Quickly. Aranias waivers. She knows now why she was guided here—not to destroy the Valenwood, but to save it.nnShe wants to change course, but she's afraid. She's afraid to stand up to Andur.",""
"55049764-3-6957","It's you …? From Silatar? My … my friend. Thank the Eight! You were right about the Veiled Heritance. I'm sure now. nnThey used me as bait to trick the Wilderking, and now Andur's going to kill him. I can't let that happen. I have to stop Andur.",""
"55049764-3-6958","It's you! And Lyris! What are you doing here?",""
"55049764-3-6967","I saw you talking to <<1>>. I hope he's finally going to do something about these ruffians and thieves.",""
"55049764-3-6968","You've returned! Don't try to interfere. Pircalmo brought this on himself. Atronachs! In our wood!",""
"55049764-3-6969","I don't know what <<1>> plans to do about these bandits, but I hope he does it soon.",""
"55049764-3-6971","What's going on? Where's Pircalmo? Where's my husband?",""
"55049764-3-6972","Another damned bandit? Oblivion take you, I have no more supplies to give you, filth.",""
"55049764-3-6977","You look weary. Perhaps you'd care to stop here and rest? We have much to offer.",""
"55049764-3-6978","My dueling lessons have finally paid off. We made it down here with almost no trouble. Well, <<1>> helped a little.nnDid you find Lady Laurent's jewels?",""
"55049764-3-6980","You look so tense! You need to relax. Please, enjoy our hospitality and let all your worries slip away.",""
"55049764-3-6981","Did it work? Yes, I can see it in your eyes! Now you can see things as they really are.",""
"55049764-3-6982","I'm half a heartbeat from throwing you out of this camp.",""
"55049764-3-6985","What?",""
"55049764-3-6993","After you receive your briefings from Hahnin and Gabrielle, select a soldier to accompany you on your mission. Choose carefully, for our plan hinges on you opening the way into the Labyrinth.nnThis is our last strike. Make it count.",""
"55049764-3-6994","I have seen more than my fair share of years. Many more. But in all that time, I've never contemplated something as foolhardy as this.nnWe're about to face a Daedric Prince for the fate of our world, and I couldn't be more proud of all of you.",""
"55049764-3-7005","What are you waiting for? Kill that horrible creature already!",""
"55049764-3-7009","Welcome, Moon Hallowed. Welcome to your first steps along the path.",""
"55049764-3-7012","I'm a brilliant artificer and a genius when it comes to Dwemer constructs. But I have to tell you, being surrounded by all these remarkable men and women .… It's kind of humbling.nnI hope I live long enough to record this in my posterity journal.",""
"55049764-3-7013","This one cannot wait to see what's inside the stronghold of the Daedric Prince!nnBut Zur wishes that Gadris was here to share this auspicious occasion.",""
"55049764-3-7015","I imagined that this was going to be a grand adventure, but I never pictured the horror of all this.nnSo many of our friends and companions have died, and this damn vortex still threatens our world. I think it's time we shut it down. Permanently.",""
"55049764-3-7026","I see you there, but you must wait. A scholar's work is seldom urgent, but I have a request from the king himself. It seems the Ansei Wards have been misplaced! nnWait, I should not have …. Um, just forget I said that.",""
"55049764-3-7027","Hurry! If you take too long, these Ungodly might decide to kill me. Find those keys!",""
"55049764-3-7028","I'm afraid you'll have to pardon me. I'm here on royal business.",""
"55049764-3-7029","Don't talk to me. I have problems. Big problems.nnYou wouldn't understand.",""
"55049764-3-7030","We did it. It was an honor to fight beside you once again. We've certainly come a long way from the Temple of the Mourning Springs, don't you think?",""
"55049764-3-7035","How much gold did you take from my daughter's dowry? How full are your pockets, you snake?",""
"55049764-3-7039","My soldiers stir from their feral state. I can only assume the corruption has receded, and Naemon is again put to rest.",""
"55049764-3-7042","At last! Sai Sahan has been taken to the Halls of Torment!",""
"55049764-3-7043","Come. I need to speak with Queen Ayrenn. I expect she'll want to speak with you as well.",""
"55049764-3-7044","Now here's one who I know is loyal to the king! It's good to see you again, my friend.nnYou're going to find this hard to believe, but the damned Imperials are here! They've seized control of the city—for the moment, at least.",""
"55049764-3-7046","I'll be with you in a moment.",""
"55049764-3-7058","You're back! You stopped <<1>>, then?nnOh, no. <<2>> didn't survive, did she?",""
"55049764-3-7060","You keep returning like some kind of scale-rot. Leave me be, outsider.",""
"55049764-3-7061","Praise Meridia! This one was worried he'd never find another living soul in this horrible place.",""
"55049764-3-7066","She is wounded! Did you hurt her?",""
"55049764-3-7068","We have to find out what they're doing.",""
"55049764-3-7069","We've got some repairs to do on the Prowler, but maybe we'll sail together again soon. Until then, stay safe.",""
"55049764-3-7070","We should check the houses, or secluded areas with good visibility of the quay.",""
"55049764-3-7071","Survivors of the Sea Viper attack will likely have hidden. Perhaps the buildings around <<1>>?",""
"55049764-3-7075","I knew we could do it! We're practically on Molag Bal's doorstep now!nnMolag Grunda is no more. At least for now. Daedra don't really die, if my studies are correct. But at lease she's out of our way for now.",""
"55049764-3-7081","Tu'whacca has taken the Chief beyond the dunes. So passes Marimah—water into sand. May all the Divines bless his passage.",""
"55049764-3-7082","We mustn't dally. Naemon's Shade and his servants clearly have larger, darker designs. nnWe should spread out and search for signs of their corruption and do our best to stamp it out wherever we can.",""
"55049764-3-7098","I think … I think I just narrowly missed Tu'whacca's summons, sister. I credit my mother. She had a stomach like an iron kettle.",""
"55049764-3-7101","Still alive, are you? And all your limbs intact? Maybe you should spend more time adventuring and less time at the tavern. Ha!",""
"55049764-3-7108","The old Fighters Guild Hall. It's near the main gate. Go!",""
"55049764-3-7109","We were able to overcome the vampiric snare of the Orchard. I expect we'll handle the Reaver Citadel with equal aplomb.",""
"55049764-3-7110","We have come so far, but we have leagues to go before this business is concluded.nnWe must push forward! We must find a way through the walls of the fortified city that looms ahead of us.",""
"55049764-3-7112","As I was saying, there's a blight here. I'd highly advise staying away.",""
"55049764-3-7113","Thank you, traveler. The barkeep in the Waxing Crescent Inn … I think his name was Duzal-ja? He has one of them, and can probably tell you where to look for the others. We have to get the relics back before Meldil makes an appearance.",""
"55049764-3-7115","Phenomenal. I knew proximity was the key! And look at you, not even a hint of electrocution.nnYou have the principle. Now, to apply it to the other <<m:1>> before … well, best not to worry you about that.",""
"55049764-3-7117","I know why you originally came here—to ask for the Wilderking's allegiance to the Aldmeri Dominion—to know the Valenwood was on your side.nnWould you still make such a request to me now?",""
"55049764-3-7118","I can't believe <<1>> let me stay like this. Come, let's help the old bones drive back the new!",""
"55049764-3-7119","We're almost free! Only one task remains.nnYou must die.",""
"55049764-3-7120","Let's go!",""
"55049764-3-7122","I already told you—I'm not going anywhere!nnThe Taskmasters in this place … they can inflict pain that should kill—but doesn't. I will not risk getting strung up by them! Not even to escape!",""
"55049764-3-7123","I didn't think we'd survive this day. Many have died, but some live.nnThank you for fighting on our behalf.",""
"55049764-3-7125","You've returned, and this one heard fighting.nnCould … Taskmaster be dead?",""
"55049764-3-7126","The Eight take this thing! Everyone's going to think I'm a thief. An incompetent thief!",""
"55049764-3-7139","Auri-El watch over you. Maybe just tell Malesse my Tacia is adopted? And that I don't want her to feel unwelcome here? I don't know. I don't understand that woman.",""
"55049764-3-7140","Welcome, welcome. We have … lots of interesting people here. Like the merchant, Sarolion. He's certainly got a story or two.",""
"55049764-3-7141","I'm the operations manager for the Summoner Division. I assume you've earned your credentials?",""
"55049764-3-7142","Drauginor's the name. Business manager for the Sorceror Division. Credentials, please.",""
"55049764-3-7143","Zara's tasked me with picking flowers, believe that? I'm a swordsman, not a flower girl! nnDamn my tongue, I can't say no to that girl. It's that purr of hers. Damned distracting.",""
"55049764-3-7144","I see you were successful.",""
"55049764-3-7145","We all saw the corruption draw back. It's such a relief.",""
"55049764-3-7146","This one is relieved to see such estimable help arrive. Raz has already volunteered to enter Hectahame himself, but the queen has forbidden it.",""
"55049764-3-7147","Quite an amazing scene to witness.",""
"55049764-3-7148","It's good to see Akkhuz-ri made it out safe and sound. Gharesh-ri tried to warn him of the danger, but he doesn't always listen. He sometimes forgets he's a spiritual leader and not a hardened warrior.",""
"55049764-3-7149","Shazah has never witnessed such a scene. Kauzanabi-jo thought this experience dangerous, but the history this one has learned. Shazah's sister may disagree, but the trip was well worth it.",""
"55049764-3-7150","Khali wanted to be there, but Lord Gharesh-ri and Kauzanabi-jo wouldn't have it. How does one expand her horizons if no allows Khali to test her skills?",""
"55049764-3-7151","To be trapped outside these walls while the Veiled Heritance destroys more lives.",""
"55049764-3-7154","It's amazing. I can't believe I witnessed the choosing of the Silvenar!",""
"55049764-3-7156","You've proven yourself a valuable member of the Aldmeri Dominion.",""
"55049764-3-7157","Thank the Eight you returned.",""
"55049764-3-7158","I see Elolir is with you. Keep him safe. He's a decent shot, but he's a fool.",""
"55049764-3-7159","Take those Daedra apart. We'll make sure the barricade stays up.nnAnd take care of Laeneval, will you? She's the last healer we have.",""
"55049764-3-7160","You have accomplished a heroic feat today, but there is more to be done.",""
"55049764-3-7161","I suggest we search for survivors. In these situations most people will try to stay hidden. Perhaps the buildings will yield results.",""
"55049764-3-7173","Back, are you? It's your funeral. nnI knew you couldn't be trusted. Now I get to take it out of your hide.",""
"55049764-3-7194","Caldien ….",""
"55049764-3-7198","I'll say a prayer to Y'ffre for my fallen brothers. I hope they'll forgive me for my corwardice. nnThank you once again, traveler.",""
"55049764-3-7208","Mara's grace! I can't tell you how humiliating it is that you had to rescue me yet again. That's the last time. I promise. nnYou need to get the Wards back though, and fast. If my father heard I had one and lost it, he'd put me in the stocks!",""
"55049764-3-7212","They'll come for me soon, and who'll miss me? No one but the rats, I tell you. No one but the rats.nnThey'll come for you too, if you're not careful.",""
"55049764-3-7214","So? Did you convince them? Oh, don't tell me! Talk to Vanus!",""
"55049764-3-7215","You shouldn't be here, traveler.",""
"55049764-3-7216","Is this your land? No? Then leave.",""
"55049764-3-7217","On your way, outsider. You'll never belong here.",""
"55049764-3-7218","Fish aren't for sale. Go catch your own.",""
"55049764-3-7219","The fortress up ahead, they call it the Reaver Citadel. If the Daedra were going for imposing, they damned well succeeded.",""
"55049764-3-7225","My old chum. My bosom companion. My comrade in arms. How long has it been? I've missed you, terribly!nnBy the way, what took you so long? The King is upstairs. He wants to speak to you.",""
"55049764-3-7228","Now comes the true test of your strength and wisdom. Alik'r needs you, <<1>>.nnYou may use the portal behind me to reach the base of the watch.",""
"55049764-3-7229","You return. What have you experienced since last we met?",""
"55049764-3-7230","I'm worried sick about Erinel. I can only pray that whoever hired her kidnappers only wishes to stop the wedding and not worse!",""
"55049764-3-7231","Shall we go and have a proper visit? I'm sure Grunda's prepared something lovely, just for the occasion.",""
"55049764-3-7232","My old life is over. I'll miss Larousse, but these are my people now. I can't just abandon them.",""
"55049764-3-7233","I wish I hadn't run. I'm not a fighter, not like Halalin and Nielas.",""
"55049764-3-7234","You? Who are you?",""
"55049764-3-7235","Still alive. Good.",""
"55049764-3-7239","Hectahame. Lovely isn't it? Especially with its moat of undead and eerily corrupted trees. As much as I know you want to take a peek inside, as long as those wards are up, no one is going anywhere near it.",""
"55049764-3-7242","Has the storm stopped? I don't think I've ever been this sick.",""
"55049764-3-7293","That is all for now. If we have need of you in the future, do not doubt this one will find you.",""
"55049764-3-7294","I'm quite busy at the moment, sorry. I'll be lucky if this haul allows me to keep myself fed, much less pay off my debts. Please leave me to my work.",""
"55049764-3-7296","Did you find out who the Artisan is?",""
"55049764-3-7305","I, Nidras, the Artisan, acknowledge that you rightfully stole my letters, and in exchange for their return, I'll tell you their story.",""
"55049764-3-7313","Hello, hello! This one has tasty foods for the hungry. What can Duzal get you?",""
"55049764-3-7319","Excuse me, sorry. I'm waiting for someone here. Someone who's trying my very last nerve.",""
"55049764-3-7321","Thank you for helping Manthir see how much he loves me. You are the best!",""
"55049764-3-7323","There's more to be done, though. Always is, isn't there?nnPrince Azah's here. He says they've tracked down the third Ansei Ward, and he wants you to join him as soon as possible at the Motalion Necropolis.",""
"55049764-3-7325","I am certain things will return to normal again soon, and these spiders will leave us.nnThey will leave, won't they?",""
"55049764-3-7330","You should've taken the gold.",""
"55049764-3-7333","Yenadar, gone to preach in a High Elf city. Kala is beside herself. Thank you for telling her. This one must arrange passage to the port of Haven at once!",""
"55049764-3-7341","Leave me. I have much to consider.",""
"55049764-3-7343","Apologies, but I must speak to my troops.",""
"55049764-3-7344","Give me a moment to cool down. Talking to those two makes my blood boil.",""
"55049764-3-7360","Don't bring any trouble to <<1>>.",""
"55049764-3-7368","Is there any reason you've chosen to interrupt my thoughts?nnIf so, make it quick. If not, begone.",""

"55049764-3-7716","Ah, the queen's champion! Honor to meet you. Means we're that much closer to getting paid. That's good, because I didn't come to Evermore for the women.nnAre you ready then? As long as you're good with the plan, this thing's going to be a breeze.",""
"55049764-3-7717","Hi there. Queen Arzhela told me about all you did for the city. Sounds like they should be building a statue.nnAnyways, compared to what you've already dealt with, this should be a cinch. Really, our part only comes into play if there's a problem.",""
"55049764-3-7719","He took the Walking City? He took my home?nnOr is this another of his lies?",""
"55049764-3-7732","The crypt is to the east, at the top of the stair. Come.",""

"55049764-3-7745","All that's left is to face the Architect. He's defended and he's powerful, but if he can be defeated ….nnYou've made miracles happen today, my friend.",""
"55049764-3-7747","Speak to Rashan.",""
"55049764-3-7748","I must admit, I'm not comfortable with this little jaunt. Sancre Tor is in the mountains of Colovia, and Colovians are the worst kind of Imperials—backwards mountain men without any sense of decorum. At least Varen will feel right at home.",""
"55049764-3-7752","This is absurd!",""
"55049764-3-7753","I barely made it out of there alive. Those things. They're like nothing I've ever seen.",""
"55049764-3-7756","Another one? Curious. What do you want?",""
"55049764-3-7757","I did what needed to be done. Isabeth knew this. Let's hope her father can open his eyes.",""
"55049764-3-7758","This is Denille's last hope. If this fails, the worst is inevitable.",""
"55049764-3-7760","For the love of Mara, I didn't think I'd see the end of this day. Did Captain Gaercroft, my father, send you?",""
"55049764-3-7762","We couldn't stop those monsters. I fear that soon all of Rivenspire may be lost!",""
"55049764-3-7764","So this trip turned out to be far shorter and far more fortuitous than I expected.nnThat's assuming you're up to the challenge, of course.",""
"55049764-3-7765","I guess it's a good thing we gave the bows to Baandari after all.",""
"55049764-3-7768","I deserve to suffer. All those lives ruined because of my petty need for vengeance. I deserve worse. Leave me be.",""
"55049764-3-7771","You convinced Knight Commander Cheryline to give up the bows? If I had asked her, she wouldn't even have spared me a wooden dagger. nnShe must really like you!",""
"55049764-3-7790","You saw the thief, yes? Or smelled him, perhaps? He was quite filthy. This one will be scrubbing the stench of him out of his clothes for a week, at least!",""

"55049764-3-7803","Well, all's well that end's well, right? Except for the real mystery—who in Northpoint was pulling Leonce's strings? And why?nnI don't think I'll sleep well until that gets resolved.",""
"55049764-3-7805","Speak of Sheogorath! You've caused quite a stir! Merchants speak of a black wind robbing them blind! Your open hand is blessed on every street corner!nnIf you were looking to make an impression, you have!",""
"55049764-3-7809","I remember now. The translation—we misinterpreted it. We assumed the Crag housed a powerful healing artifact. But we were wrong.nnThe hillside community, though. Why didn't I ever look into that?",""
"55049764-3-7811","When you went below into the crypts this foul icy fog rolled in. The earth shook and those Dolmen emerged from the ground beneath our feet. nnWe retreated here to await your return, the rest you can clearly see.",""
"55049764-3-7813","Hungry … so hungry. A sweetcake would be nice. Candied mammoth tail swimming in sparkle-syrup. Honeyfly bisque over a comb the size of my head … oh, I can almost taste it!",""

"55049764-3-7819","There was a time this place was nothin' but a game trail, if you believe it. Blacksaps used to ambush old coins not familiar with the Valenwood.nnThat's where I came in. Know these woods like the back of my hand. Blacksaps never saw us comin'.",""
"55049764-3-7822","If we can't get the information we need, we may be better off barricading Evermore completely and preparing for siege.nnIf you can help, please speak with Captain Gaercroft. We need it.",""

"55049764-3-7825","You're such a good person! I know that Puddles will be home in no time now that you're out there looking for her.nnI could see it in her eyes when we arrived. Puddles really wanted to go out and explore this new city. She's very curious, you know.",""
"55049764-3-7828","This place, it speaks to me. It whispers in my ear, sings into my soul. It runs through my blood like cold fire. nnBut none of that matters. When we save Leila, it will all be worth it.",""

"55049764-3-7890","I'm surprised you made it. The Houses informed me of what took place in the Doomcrag. Most soldiers would have perished inside of there.nnYet here you stand. Commendable and respectable.",""
"55049764-3-7892","Have you found the crown?",""
"55049764-3-7894","I've said all I'm going to say. We both know this isn't true justice. If your Dominion means what it says, it will give my family a public trial.",""

"55049764-3-7929","You've returned. What have you learned of the Khajiit Embassy?",""
"55049764-3-7930","I heard what you said to the king. <<1>>, a traitor; my wife's killer, a loyal servant; and I, <<2>>'s representative in <<3>>, required to thank you for your efforts.nnVery well. I'll provide no reason to question my duty to the Dominion.",""

"55049764-3-7942","Well, friend, I'm glad to see you were able to help out with the High King's arrival. It's nice to see that some people are willing to do their part for crown and country.",""
"55049764-3-7945","You're confident, I'll give you that. Strode right up to the king.",""

"55049764-3-7949","Every night since the massacre, I've dreamt of the horrors the Jade Butcher brought to <<1>>. It seems fitting to meet the one who brought her to justice on the very spot she slew the Blacksap.nnI wonder, will I have nightmares of you?",""
"55049764-3-7950","Our farm … everything we owned. It's all gone.",""

"55049764-3-7953","Verandis told us stories of this place. How the current trouble began here. Shornhelm—all of Rivenspire—threatened because of a single event that occurred in the Doomcrag.",""
"55049764-3-7955","Thanks again. Now I can give the treethane his bow back. I'm a free Elf!nnTake care of yourself out there. <<1>> is a dangerous place, as <<2>> discovered.",""
"55049764-3-7956","Damn it. What went wrong? The vampire lord should have appeared by now. nnWhere are Zungarg and Agalir?",""
"55049764-3-7957","What happened to our family is terrible, but as the bards say, life goes on.nnMy sister and I came up here to … well, to give them a proper burial.",""
"55049764-3-7958","Why? Why did they have to leave us?",""
"55049764-3-7960","I think that Countess Tamrith and Baron Dorell both could be excellent rulers. The important thing is that we crown someone. And today must be the day.",""
"55049764-3-7961","Fear not, Vestige. When Sai Sahan and the others return, we will slip into the shadow of Sancre Tor and retrieve the Amulet of Kings.",""
"55049764-3-7962","Are you with the Vinedusk Rangers? The Justiciars? The Fighters Guild?nnIt doesn't matter. I know why you're here.",""
"55049764-3-7967","<<1>> says you're to thank for uncovering a traitor in our midst.",""
"55049764-3-7968","I don't understand …. How can I cook dinner now?",""
"55049764-3-7969","My brother … my Nedras. All this gold ….",""
"55049764-3-7971","I'll be better off without him. Yes. Now that I know he's not coming back, I can move on with my life. Better off without that stupid mule!",""
"55049764-3-7972","Yenadar, gone to preach in a High Elf city. Kala is beside herself. Thank you for telling her, traveler. This one must arrange passage to the port of Haven at once!",""

"55049764-3-7977","Well, kiss a troll and call me pumpkin! I know you! From Shornhelm! Did Baron Dorell send you?nnI was the Orc. In the cage. Not my most shining moment, but it's not like I'm a noble or anything. No matter. I'm just glad you're here.",""
"55049764-3-7985","Fortunately, I'm on the stealthy side. That's not Snaruga's way, though.nnThe old girl gave the Imperials too many black eyes. They dare not trust her with a pick!",""
"55049764-3-7986","No one seems to be asking where these Imperials are coming from. We're a long way from Cyrodiil. Something is amiss here.",""
"55049764-3-7987","Don't drag your feet. The slow hunter never catches his prey, and I can't keep this gateway open forever.",""
"55049764-3-7990","These Imperial dogs are vicious but smart. They know they can't beat us in a direct confrontation, so they starve us out. I'd like to compliment their commander before killing him.",""

"55049764-3-8004","I've ruined everything ….",""
"55049764-3-8005","Good luck ….",""
"55049764-3-8006","Have you seen my husband, Najan? We should go to him.",""
"55049764-3-8009","Touch the symbol of Arkay. Profane the Forsaker.",""
"55049764-3-8011","Nothing to see here. Move along.",""
"55049764-3-8012","Heroes, gods, Imperials … who's in charge here? You. You've earned the blessings of the heroes, but blessings will only get you through the door.nnAre you really ready for what lies on the other side?",""
"55049764-3-8014","This is rather disconcerting. I don't believe I've ever had a conversation with a monkey before.",""
"55049764-3-8015","I must seek my fortune. And you must go elsewhere to seek yours.",""
"55049764-3-8031","You know, there were rumors that Ranser was betrayed by his chief military advisor, General Dathieu.nnIf Ranser was decapitated, that might suggest the rumors were true. How can we be sure, though?",""
"55049764-3-8036","Your kin live among the mortals. They may be wearing rags or crowns. They may hide within or rise above the masses.nnAs your Bloodspeaker found you, you must find them. They await.",""
"55049764-3-8037","Go on. Go find the rest of our assault team. I'll have this place all cozy like in no time!",""
"55049764-3-8040","The falls you seek are southwest of here, overlooking Gil-Var-Delle. Simply let some of the water from the vial fall at each crest, and the flow will carry it across Gil-Var-Delle so that the earth may drink and be cleansed.",""
"55049764-3-8044","Even with a single performer back on the job, I see smiling faces. I think we're starting to draw a crowd!nnWhatever you've been doing, keep doing it!",""
"55049764-3-8046","May Arkay drive back the darkness, forever more.",""
"55049764-3-8050","Oh! You took the shipment to <<1>>? And you don't smell like fungus and rotten meat … good work.",""
"55049764-3-8055","Any luck with the supplies? They should still be in <<1>>.",""
"55049764-3-8058","My you smell lovely … delightful. How delightful.",""
"55049764-3-8059","As soon as he gets home, I'm going to give my husband a piece of my mind. Edouard will be lucky if I don't throw him out after all this trouble.",""
"55049764-3-8068","I apologive profusely for the burden that escorting <<1>> surely inflicted upon you.nnI will safeguard him from here, so that he takes nothing of this place with him aside from stories.",""
"55049764-3-8069","I owe Ufa a favor, not you. Be on your way to do what you must. I'm sure I'll see you later at The Drowsy Owl Inn.",""

"55049764-3-8072","Ah yes, I recall you from before. You failed to find the relic I was hunting in the Alik'r. At least you didn't fail to find <<1>>.nnI don't suppose you'd be willing to help me find something else, just to prove you're not entirely inept?",""
"55049764-3-8078","An abandoned house. Lovely. One day, my dear, you'll need to take me somewhere nice.nnWell, let's go investigate.",""
"55049764-3-8082","That's an interesting story. If Naruk had Kaleen under duress, wouldn't she alert the guard? Now I'm curious.",""
"55049764-3-8084","Thank you. A find like this is incredibly rare. It could greatly advance our understanding of the Valenwood Ayleids and their unique dialect. I must begin translating immediately!",""
"55049764-3-8088","No. Don't tell me he's dead. He can't be.",""
"55049764-3-8089","Is that your friend? See to her. I'll watch your back.",""

"55049764-3-8136","Hello there. I suggest you don't try to pick me up. You'll only injure your back.nnDon't ask for any long-winded explanations either. It's tiring to talk when you're made of iron.",""

"55049764-3-8139","<<1>> believes we Covenant troops require a symbol to rally behind, but he is mistaken. nnThe Old Tower is occupied by an Imperial Cohort. No stolen hat will change those odds.",""

"55049764-3-8336","Talk to Skordo. He has a plan. It's a bit crude, but it just might work.nnAt least, it has the advantage of being remarkably simple and easy to remember. I appreciate that in a plan.",""
"55049764-3-8341","I see plenty of Montclair's monsters, but no survivors. Let's keep looking.",""
"55049764-3-8342","It has been a grueling day. Restock and rest. We'll begin the march to the Doomcrag when you're ready.",""

"55049764-3-8346","We are lucky you came along when you did. Had you been but a moment later … I hate to think what might have happened.",""
"55049764-3-8347","It's so strange to have Federic return after all this time only to leave again. But I think I'm done being lonely. <<1>> has been wonderful to me. It's time I gave her a chance.",""
"55049764-3-8348","And everything goes back to the way it was … I don't know how I feel about that.",""
"55049764-3-8349","My wife, is she …?",""
"55049764-3-8350","Whatever will become of our dearest Arlie, now? With <<1>> and Federic leaving, it's as though the light has gone out of her eyes.nnPerhaps I can find someone in <<2>> to keep her company.",""
"55049764-3-8351","I've decided to make this a personal challenge. I'm going to turn things around for the Shornhelm Guard. They'll be the most feared outfit in all the Covenant by next year. You can bet on it!",""
"55049764-3-8354","Thank you for walking with me Adept. I know what I need to do, now. I just need a few more minutes outside before I return to complete the work on the volume you found.",""

"55049764-3-8368","I didn't have time to explore when we were here last. It's far larger than I realized.nnWho knows what treasures may rest within these ruins? The Ayleids have always been such a mystery.",""

"55049764-3-8374","Good day to be out on the sea, isn't it? So why am I standing around here on the docks you might ask …? That's good damn question. nnAsk Captain Marck.",""
"55049764-3-8375","It's good to see you here. It's long overdue for Rivenspire to get a new ruler! nnAs you can see, Julien and Shuga are here. They've surprised even me with their valor in battle. Sadly, we lost Martin. He went down fighting, though. That's something.",""
"55049764-3-8383","The burnt bones foretold death, and death came. They also showed me things which confused me. Hidden things, secret things. And the arrival of someone who can help.nnWhat news do you bring?",""
"55049764-3-8386","Excuse me. Hara says you've joined our number.nnThat's very exciting, because I believe I've discovered something that can help us understand who or what the Celestials really are.",""

"55049764-3-8395","Are we safe here in the lower city? Will Baron Montclair's forces attack us down here? I can't stand all this waiting!",""
"55049764-3-8397","A friendly face! Good, good. This day may not be a complete failure.",""
"55049764-3-8398","Ah! Oh! Oh … you're … not who I thought you were.nnI'd clear out, stranger. Spiders in this cave. Lots and lots of spiders!",""
"55049764-3-8399","Stars above, finally someone with a bit of sense to them. Please, traveler. Help out a fair trader, aye?",""
"55049764-3-8406","These Covenant soldiers are prickly sons of bitches. But we'll hold them back.nnI'm sure of it.",""
"55049764-3-8407","I remember when I'd hunt here for days and not see a soul. The war was on, and people stayed behind walls or stuck to roads. Those days are behind us.",""
"55049764-3-8409","Shoes? Shoes are for lesser men! My manly toes need to breathe! It's a medicinal fact.",""
"55049764-3-8417","Use the torch to burn the dead. I'll follow behind you and perform the ritual of sanctification.",""
"55049764-3-8418","Priest Marnest is surprisingly more helpful than I anticipated. Comforting the refugees, performing blessings and rituals, cooking and cleaning. He even tells a pretty good story.",""
"55049764-3-8422","Ah, it's good to see you again, friend. And what can I do for the hero of Northpoint?",""
"55049764-3-8429","You have the gratitude of Sen Dres, my new friend. I'd raise a goblet of wine with you, if there was time. But there isn't.",""

"55049764-3-8454","Hey there, traveler. Go well on your journey.",""
"55049764-3-8455","I'm going to stay here with my brother. See what you can find in the chambers we passed through.",""
"55049764-3-8460","Keep your distance. No need to contract the plague on my account.",""
"55049764-3-8461","I can't find them anywhere!",""

"55049764-3-8470","They're all dead. I'm sure of it. Now how can I possibly complete our mission?",""
"55049764-3-8471","The Llodos plague … I have no idea why, but it's clear to me that the Maulborn curative is actually the source of the disease.nnWhatever they're planning, you have to stop them.",""
"55049764-3-8478","It's horrible there are injured people all over the city!",""
"55049764-3-8484","Were you able to acquire any samples of the Maulborn curative? I'm really curious to see what the elixir is made of.",""
"55049764-3-8485","Thank the Eight! Please, you have to help us. We can't keep them contained much longer!",""
"55049764-3-8486","I must emphasize to both you and these Bosmer that we did not desire this duty, nor do we take any joy in it, but we cannot act against our directives.nnThe only way one might circumvent this is to destroy us, and that would be very difficult to do.",""
"55049764-3-8487","Auri-El preserve me! A friendly face! Please, you have to help us. We can't keep them contained much longer!",""
"55049764-3-8491","Always good to speak with another knowledge-seeker. Guildmaster Vanus will be pleased!",""
"55049764-3-8493","I knew you'd find everything Nilyne needed! Please, talk to the alchemist and give her the additives she's been waiting for.",""
"55049764-3-8494","Erunor will make an excellent caretaker. He's always been a stickler for details. I remember when he was just a lad, before the village left last time.nnOr maybe that was his older brother? Hmm.",""
"55049764-3-8496","Haven't you ever made a potion before? My notes are by the table. I need to care for my patient now, but my notes should be able to guide you through the process.",""
"55049764-3-8497","Once again, you show up just when you're needed most. Nilyne has been waiting patiently for you. Well, mostly patiently.nnPlease, talk to her and let her know what you were able to find.",""
"55049764-3-8498","I'd welcome you to the Brooding Elf Inn, but I'm not in a very friendly mood. Between the plague and the Maulborn, I'm at my wit's end.nnStill, if there's something I can get you, feel free to ask.",""
"55049764-3-8508","Good, good. I know we'll be drawing blades together soon enough.nnNow, what can I tell you?",""
"55049764-3-8509","It's good to have another new face around here. I'm just a student that came to study with the Star-Gazers. I never expected I'd see an event like this! It's terrifying, but it could mean a chance to learn so much more about the Celestials.",""
"55049764-3-8513","Good luck exploring the caves of Daen Seeth. The Ashlands is an exciting place for travelers and adventurers. nnMe? I'll just stay here in my nice, cozy tavern. Mmm … Bile Beer.",""

"55049764-3-8538","You are generous to humor two silly old men, but those seeds would mean so much to us. When we were young, we used to sneak away from the clan and come here to be together.nnLying here among the Nereid's Smile, it seemed like we had forever.",""

"55049764-4-4992","With the Pact working together again, we should be able to sniff out Fildgor's spies easily enough.nnNow my only concern is for the King. He's surrounded himself with our strongest warriors, but the element of surprise gives Fildgor an advantage.",""
"55049764-4-4995","Thallik is dead. Long live Sinmur, eh?",""
"55049764-4-5001","I appreciate your … understanding in this manner. Our very lives are at stake.",""
"55049764-4-5004","Greetings!",""
"55049764-4-5009","The cultists. They came out of nowhere. Aera. She was leading them!  She demanded I join the cult. nnSurprised … surprised her.",""
"55049764-4-5010","Hello again, Vestige. I'm afraid I'm quite busy puzzling out the particulars of what we discovered in the ruin. Varen and I should have a lead soon.",""
"55049764-4-5013","Sorry, I'm busy. Don't have time to be bothered.",""
"55049764-4-5020","Search around for any clues that might help us unlock those doors.nnI'll look around down here and make sure that none of Dhalen's thugs get inside.",""

"55049764-4-5028","I tried to raise my granddaughter well, but she's always defying Thorulf.",""
"55049764-4-5029","Have you found anything?",""
"55049764-4-5032","Good to meet you! You fought beside the Centurion at Shor's, yeah? Amazing!",""
"55049764-4-5033","What luck! You helped avenge my beloved Silvenar in <<1>>.nnTell me, would you lend your striking arm to my cause once more?",""
"55049764-4-5034","Imiril will live, but I need you to give me space.",""
"55049764-4-5036","Well, I've lost almost my entire shipment. But Turil doesn't even have this! His misery is like sweet nectar to me.",""
"55049764-4-5037","This was all you could get, eh? Well, you did risk your life. And Enthis is miserable. Hah!",""
"55049764-4-5044","I can't hope to replace Tirora. But I'll do my best to honor her memory.",""
"55049764-4-5046","Give me a moment. I'll be right behind you.",""

"55049764-4-5053","Welcome back to the arms of the guild, comrade.",""
"55049764-4-5054","Where could they be? Why haven't they returned?",""
"55049764-4-5058","Well? You going to just stand there?",""
"55049764-4-5059","Thank Kyne you're here! Wait, you are here to help, aren't you?",""
"55049764-4-5060","With Valdur on our side once again, who will stand against us? Any time you need it, my blade is yours.",""

"55049764-4-5063","Your actions won't be forgotten, so long as our roots touch earth.",""
"55049764-4-5064","You have done the whole of Valenwood a great service.",""
"55049764-4-5069","The sun shines brightly on your path, recruit. You've made it back just in time.nnMerric's had a breakthrough with the Soul Gem. He needs your help.",""

"55049764-4-5083","While you were gone, Thorulf made a proposal. I told him what he could do with himself. Disgusting man!nnWhat news?",""
"55049764-4-5086","Good, you're here. I wanted to begin sooner, but Shalidor wanted me to be patient. That's not my strong suit.nnThe book has been translated. Are you prepared for Sheogorath's first test?",""
"55049764-4-5087","Forest spirits, indeed. I don't know what type of mushrooms those were, but the effects were clearly mind-altering.nnSheogorath's choices deserve what they get.",""
"55049764-4-5088","Look at this place! So drab. Mages! What do they know, eh?nnSo <<1>> finished the book, did she?",""
"55049764-4-5089","Ah, just the person I wanted to see. I managed to puzzle out what the last book was referring to.",""
"55049764-4-5091","It's mine. They can't have it! Keep it safe. Keep it hidden.",""
"55049764-4-5096","He's called a gathering of the Council of Province Generals in Sentinel. You should find him at the Hall there.",""

"55049764-4-5110","The door should be unlocked.nnGet to the sanctum and stop the ritual. I'll seal the door behind you to make sure nothing interferes from this side.",""

"55049764-4-5118","<<1>> will be our greatest challenge. You might not survive it.",""
"55049764-4-5119","<<1>> is a blight upon the land. Our task will not be easy.",""

"55049764-4-5127","You have the weapons? Excellent! Get them to the townsfolk as quickly as you can. We'll rally them at the bridge and drive those invaders back into the sea!",""
"55049764-4-5128","That Ra Gada captain must die! Don't give up!",""
"55049764-4-5129","We made it! Ah, such a peaceful glade. Gorgeous, isn't it?",""
"55049764-4-5135","Most unfortunate that one had to die. Still, it's better one of their number falls than one of ours.nnYou have the letter, yes?",""
"55049764-4-5136","The lieutenant died for Velyn Harbor. The sergeant taught us to fight for ourselves.nnMaybe it's time we stepped up and helped out more.",""
"55049764-4-5140","That tomb down there. I don't … don't waste time talking to me. Get down there and find out what they're up to.",""

"55049764-4-5173","Do not waste my time.",""
"55049764-4-5175","You have the necessary ingredients to make Tildur's fireflask? Excellent. nnI've been watching the Maormer come and go from the lighthouse, and discovered how they get past the ward on the door.",""
"55049764-4-5176","My tools should all still be in the residential district. The Drublog wouldn't know what to do wtih them.",""
"55049764-4-5183","Lucius isn't with you. Tell me you didn't find him yet.",""
"55049764-4-5184","My friend returns. Are the rituals completed? Are the priestesses safe?",""
"55049764-4-5189","Good luck, traveler. The lattice may be the last hope for the fallen.",""
"55049764-4-5191","We must see to it that no more monsters invade our world from yours.",""
"55049764-4-5193","We came here to honor our ancestors, and now they seem bloody well determined to kill us!",""
"55049764-4-5196","<<1>> said you'd meet me here.",""
"55049764-4-5200","Only one stone remains. Quickly now!",""
"55049764-4-5205","What happened inside? Is Jorunn safe?",""
"55049764-4-5213","I need you to head to Riften as soon as possible. We can't let <<1>> run unchecked in the Smokefrost Peaks.",""
"55049764-4-5215","I must keep an eye on two places at once. Good thing I still have both my eyes, yes?",""
"55049764-4-5219","We'll be waiting in the barn down the road. Good luck in there.",""
"55049764-4-5221","All this standing around is driving me mad. I wouldn't presume to question the king's orders, but I'm ready to get this battle started.nnWell, if you're as anxious as I am to squash some Worms, I could use your help.",""
"55049764-4-5224","Fascinating. You see them, don't you?nnThis will make a marvelous addition to my studies.",""
"55049764-4-5233","Poor thing. When my brother was killed, her mind just snapped. Keeps babbling about the water.",""
"55049764-4-5234","I know the other musicians and our instruments are in this ravine, somewhere.nnPlease find them! I'll try to reach our camp. Find them and meet me there!",""

"55049764-4-5237","You fight the Houndsmen; I'll get back to the camp. I won't give up performing that easily!",""
"55049764-4-5238","My goodness, it's you! Bedraggled, but mostly intact, I see.",""
"55049764-4-5240","Between the Worm Cult and the giants the Pact troops are getting pounded. There's got to be a way we can help!",""
"55049764-4-5243","The Queen's safety is my primary concern. Everything else is just bookkeeping.",""
"55049764-4-5244","How great to be a part of this!",""
"55049764-4-5256","The Worm Cult is finished here. With <<1>> dead, their threat to the Rift is over.",""
"55049764-4-5257","I hope I never hear the words ""Worm Cult"" ever again.",""
"55049764-4-5264","I saw three satisfied mercenaries leave here. Things went well, then?",""
"55049764-4-5265","Thanks to you, the Worm Cult has been defeated and <<1>> has been returned to the grave.",""
"55049764-4-5268","I pray you found them. We need all the help we can get.",""
"55049764-4-5269","I pray you found Urcelmo. The Eight know we need all the help we can get.",""
"55049764-4-5270","Excellent work. With the wards down, we can focus on these portals.",""
"55049764-4-5271","Excellent! We couldn't have done it without you.",""
"55049764-4-5278","Your Queen has need of you.",""
"55049764-4-5281","Well done.",""
"55049764-4-5282","Well fought, and well earned!",""
"55049764-4-5283","Well fought! Well fought indeed!",""
"55049764-4-5288","Plant this among Bar-Neeus's wares. And speak only to Bronorr at the Fighters Guild when it's done.",""
"55049764-4-5292","Still around? I'd have thought you'd have moved on by now.",""
"55049764-4-5293","Salloweed's pretty potent stuff. Gathering it should be safe enough. As long as you don't eat it, you'll be fine. I think.",""
"55049764-4-5295","Ho there, friend! Welcome to my little shrine to Kyne.nnI can sense a force, a spirit, radiating from you. You're here to take the Trial, right?",""
"55049764-4-5298","One down, and you look confident about the second riddle. What's the answer?",""
"55049764-4-5305","Raz cannot say what you will find in the lands beyond. nnHe doubts what you find will be friendly.",""
"55049764-4-5309","The lich is dead and my troopers are freed. Time to move on.nnI'm going to take the shard to Jorunn at Trolhetta. I hope to see you there.",""

"55049764-4-5320","I practically worshipped that Nord! The very thought of being alone with him  … hearing his sonnets by moonlight ….nnTell him I know where he can go shelve his other book.",""
"55049764-4-5323","See you on the other side, little one.",""
"55049764-4-5324","Listen, you can't tell the canonreeve. She'll kill me.nnI'm not—I'm not joking. She'll have me put to a blade.",""
"55049764-4-5344","Please. My sons. What's happened?",""
"55049764-4-5347","You owe me a song.",""
"55049764-4-5348","Do I look like I want to talk to you?",""
"55049764-4-5352","Hendil's not expecting visitors. So I'm going to guess you're here to talk to good old Taniril?",""
"55049764-4-5366","I heard … I heard the battle. Impressive.nnI assume you won?",""
"55049764-4-5370","And so it begins, that which I have dreamt amidst nightmare.",""
"55049764-4-5384","<The statue looks very lifelike.>",""
"55049764-4-5387","I suppose it makes sense. At their core the Reachmen and the Worms both venerate the Daedra. nnJust never figured they'd do anything like this ….",""
"55049764-4-5401","What's <<1>> waiting for? I can smell the tide turning.nnWhoever said the Broken Coast bastards were competent sailors must have taken a knock to the head.",""
"55049764-4-5403","The treasure turned out to be garbage. What a waste of time.",""
"55049764-4-5405","Rilyn told me you found the bandits who did this. Thank you.",""
"55049764-4-5406","What a mess this is. Bandits, you think? Or maybe Covenant raiders?",""
"55049764-4-5407","Hold up there, traveler. I'd head back the way you came if I were you.",""
"55049764-4-5408","Careful. Not safe in this part of Auridon. You walk the road in Phaer at your own risk.",""
"55049764-4-5415","About time Harnald sent someone. I need help here!",""
"55049764-4-5416","The Smokefrost Peaks should be a lot safer, thanks to you.",""
"55049764-4-5418","Did Harnald send you to help? About time he sent someone.",""
"55049764-4-5422","Darling! Can you hear me? I'll save you!nnIt's working! I can feel it! The portal opens!",""
"55049764-4-5423","Living up to expectations, I hope? Eminwe and Norion are important members of the court. Wouldn't want them annoyed with you.",""
"55049764-4-5428","What do you want from us? Who do you serve?",""
"55049764-4-5429","Are you still here? I could swear I set you a task.",""

"55049764-4-5466","She just stirs my ire. It can't be helped. One day, I meant to respond with ""Yes, ma'am"" but all that came out was ""die to a pox, you filthy witch.""nnYou can see my problem.",""
"55049764-4-5473","You must have a death wish. Very well, that's madness I can use. What to handle first ….nnI need to know how the Spider Cult is indoctrinating their victims. If you can free my captured Guildmates up ahead, they may be able to share some insight.",""

"55049764-4-5625","My new friend! You live. I was hoping. As you can see, we received reinforcements. The Dremora have been dispatched?",""
"55049764-4-5629","You're back, but I don't see Raynor. What's going on?",""
"55049764-4-5631","Look what my father's selfishness has cost us! How could he have been so foolish?",""
"55049764-4-5633","As I feared, we arrived in different locations. I am in a city near the sea, in a land of eternal spring. The air smells of the ocean and of markets and gardens.nnIt matters not. You have awakened once again and we must set you on your path.",""
"55049764-4-5635","You have chosen a side. Now understand that only one contestant can win this game.nnAnd, as always, I can change the rules without warning in order to keep the contest exciting.",""
"55049764-4-5636","My Nelhilda would thank you if she could. nnOh, this is all my fault! I was just trying to save my failing business. Now look at us. These people used to respect me. I used to help them.",""
"55049764-4-5655","I told the last person. I won't leave here without my father!",""
"55049764-4-5657","I suppose you want to know what the plan is, then?",""
"55049764-4-5658","Ayem's garters, that was sudden! Oh, erm … Master Sai Sahan. Hello.",""
"55049764-4-5659","What? Expecting some helpless girl?",""
"55049764-4-5660","More and more, I begin to think Imperial living is all about almost getting killed every day.",""
"55049764-4-5661","Ah, hello! Good to see a friendly person right now, yeah?nnThey didn't get my face, did they?",""
"55049764-4-5699","I need to practice my dueling technique. I hope it comes back to me. I used to be quite good.",""
"55049764-4-5701","Keep him safe down there, please. The Rilis line is strewn with hard hearts and cruel men.",""
"55049764-4-5713","I know you helped all of the mages before you chose a side, but such generosity could return to harm you.nnBe careful out there.",""
"55049764-4-5714","The scent of death lingers about you.nnThis one supposes you found a way to harness the true power of the rune, yes?",""
"55049764-4-5726","<Raynor Vanos ignores you.>",""
"55049764-4-5727","We will find this city you speak of. With Juline at my side, the journey will be easier.",""
"55049764-4-5734","I knew you would choose me! But do not think that this puts me in your debt. I've decided to help you because Molag Bal deserted me. Now I only want to get off this miserable plane.nnWe may be allies now, but we aren't friends.",""
"55049764-4-5735","Ah, there you are. Estre sent me to find you.nnShe said the Observer was changing the rules. She sent me away just as our cruel gamemaster appeared. He seemed very angry, but I also got the impression that he was … excited. What did you do?",""
"55049764-4-5736","See? That wasn't so hard. There's always a way to get everything you want. Believe me, that's a philosophy I live by.nnNow that we're free, where do we go from here?",""
"55049764-4-5740","I'm not going back in there.",""
"55049764-4-5741","The scholars shall be at your side when we are needed most. Good luck, outsider.",""
"55049764-4-5749","Join in, relax. It's just mead. Laughter and good times are always on tap here at the Everfull Flagon.",""
"55049764-4-5752","Remember—Imperials bleed just as easily as any other men.",""
"55049764-4-5772","My head is full of cobwebs. I can't remember which guar had the ruby.nnPlease, search all of them. The Hist will guide you, I know it!",""
"55049764-4-5775","I know I'm going to regret listening to you. Just another day in the life of <<1>>, the madman's apprentice.",""
"55049764-4-5776","Thank you for helping my research. The amulet may need a few modifications. Otherwise, a successful test!",""
"55049764-4-5777","Oh, thank Mara. You're with the reinforcements, right?",""
"55049764-4-5786","I'll give <<1>> your message. See you inside the fort!",""
"55049764-4-5787","I heard someone was down there teaching the slavers a lesson. I'm guessing you're that someone. nnAny signs they're planning something else?",""
"55049764-4-5790","Glad to have your help. Everyone else is too busy, sick, or superstitious to help me stop the poison.",""
"55049764-4-5791","Their streets are thick with Jackdaws. They're celebrating, so they aren't too alert … but if they see you, they'll sober up fast.",""
"55049764-4-5792","She's going to let me go, just like that?",""
"55049764-4-5793","I've nothing else to say to you. You're no better than a common thief. Perhaps you'd like my skiff as well, just to sink it into the swamp?",""
"55049764-4-5794","The Daedra have stirred up the sleeping dead that guarded this tomb. We were able to skirt them before, but now they will be awake and attack any who come near.",""
"55049764-4-5795","It will take time to fully recover from both the attacks and the betrayals, but in time we shall be stronger than ever. And we have you to thank for giving us the opportunity to do so.",""
"55049764-4-5796","Did you get the bark? We don't have much time left.",""
"55049764-4-5797","I can't wait to shake the dust of this place off my shoulders.",""
"55049764-4-5800","I stashed the goods around the square, but pirates have a nose for hidden treasures. Look for my stashes, or pirates with sticky fingers.nnAnd I mean that … <<z:1>>, <<z:2>>, and <<z:3>> don't wash off. Bring them to my contact in the Mages Guild.",""
"55049764-4-5806","Ah, a friendly face … but now isn't the time for idle chatting. I've got a little business to take care of. Can I see you later, perhaps at the inn?",""
"55049764-4-5807","You've done this quest before.  You must really like it!",""
"55049764-4-5808","Have you brought me proof? What did <<1>> say?",""
"55049764-4-5809","The empty one returns. Take your respite in this place should you need. The outer world is dangerous.",""
"55049764-4-5817","You! I hadn't thought you'd make it out alive. <<1>> must have been formidable alone … with <<Ac:2>> in her hands, I can hardly imagine.nnYou do have it, don't you?",""
"55049764-4-5821","Just talk to one of the racers here. Grab a frog and you'll be good to go.",""
"55049764-4-5830","Been waiting for you. The boss sent me. Need to deal with this Heritance situation, now that we know Estre's turned.",""
"55049764-4-5832","You've done this quest before.  You must really like it!",""
"55049764-4-5835","The sound of hammer on iron is a beautiful thing to hear, whether in battle or at the forge.nnBut our mine produces tin. Can't keep a good rhythm with tin.",""
"55049764-4-5836","Gargak holds the answers you seek. Please, listen to him.",""
"55049764-4-5837","My stomach hurts. I hope it isn't the curse.",""
"55049764-4-5845","The Heart … it's good you found it, but the cost ….",""
"55049764-4-5846","How could anyone willingly leave this room? So many books! And to think, more secrets locked just beyond our grasp.",""
"55049764-4-5849","<<1>> knew you could do it. Pact-soldier is talented and merciful!nnThe door's seal will fade. <<2>> will not expect this. No, not at all.",""
"55049764-4-5851","Glad to see you made it back. The troopers you freed ran in just a bit ago. They were pretty happy to be among friends.",""
"55049764-4-5856","Go on without me comrade. This one just wants to ponder this scene a few moments more.",""
"55049764-4-5859","There's a lot of blood on your hands, isn't there? A lot of blood.nnI like that.",""
"55049764-4-5860","I'll get topside and alert the Mages Guild as soon as I catch my breath. Xuth, something awful is coming ….",""
"55049764-4-5863","You! Insipid child, meddling in a box of toys you do not understand! You were in my sanctum!",""
"55049764-4-5885","The Eye was within my grasp. Months of planning wiped out in seconds. How could this happen?",""
"55049764-4-5890","Excellent work. Bthzark breathes again!nnNow for a personal project. How would you like to earn a little more coin?",""
"55049764-4-5892","Now's the chance! Slip past the mutineers and put some holes in <<1>>!nnGo, save my wife from that backstabbing piece of squid jerky!",""
"55049764-4-5893","There's no one so superstitious as a soldier on the eve of battle.",""
"55049764-4-5894","Welcome, Adept. I've deciphered the spell inside the book. Are you prepared for Sheogorath's first test?",""
"55049764-4-5895","I'll journey through with you, but I'm not sure how long I'll be able to stay within the Isles. If Sheogorath is there, he may not be pleased to see me.",""
"55049764-4-5897","It is not wise to keep my lord waiting. His lucidity is as fleeting as my smile.",""
"55049764-4-5898","Messy business, this is; never seems to be a job where there aren't bodies stacked high, these days. You're back, so may I assume Nelanya is one of them?",""
"55049764-4-5899","Hmm, what? Oh, I … I'm not asleep! I told the captain I wouldn't sleep. I'm staying awake. That's right! Staying awake.",""
"55049764-4-5900","Mmm, those chickens smell delicious, dearie.",""
"55049764-4-5903","Elf not hurt Byz, but he threaten to.nnWhy people always threaten to hurt Byz?",""
"55049764-4-5908","Your business lies with Lord Sheogorath.",""
"55049764-4-5911","Nice work, very nice. Always good to see Shazah out from behind her books.",""
"55049764-4-5920","She wouldn't know an epic poem from a lunar chant, but Khali certainly is good with a blade. Well done.",""
"55049764-4-5922","Look at it go!",""
"55049764-4-5923","Be careful where you tread. Contrary to most children's tales the Dwemer were not kindly creatures.nnIt's likely there's mechanical traps and construct warriors lying in wait.",""
"55049764-4-5924","May the Eight bless you and watch over you.",""
"55049764-4-5931","It will take time to find buyers for everything, but I expect quite the haul, yes?",""
"55049764-4-5943","I see. There really is no other way, is there?",""
"55049764-4-5946","Look, Haskill! Forky's back! It's so nice to see him again!nnOh. And good to see you too, mortal. I guess.",""
"55049764-4-5947","The Hound. He has gone too far!nnIf what he said was true, the Silvenar—my Silvenar—is gone!",""
"55049764-4-5952","Baan Dar's grace upon you, traveler! I'll be waiting for you in the Bosmer camp when you get back up here.",""
"55049764-4-5953","Quick, head downstairs and slip the poison into a wine bottle. One of the green ones with the House Dres sigil. I noticed some loose bottles on top of the crates in the cellar.",""
"55049764-4-5957","<The lieutenant is dead.>",""
"55049764-4-5960","Jilan-dar is glad to see a not-green face!",""
"55049764-4-5970","I've known <<c:1>> for a long time, but she is not a Drublog, as my uncle constantly reminds me.",""
"55049764-4-5971","All this is my fault. My flesh and blood, dead. Because I wouldn't listen.nnBut, that's not your concern. Will you go after the Silvenar next?",""
"55049764-4-5979","Wonderful fight.",""
"55049764-4-5980","It's not often I meet someone as amazing as myself.",""
"55049764-4-5981","You've impressed me. That don't happen often.",""
"55049764-4-5982","It's good you're here. The general says the battle does not go as well as he hoped. I told him you could help.nnI've had little time to search for the Omen. Did you learn anything in Wayrest? Anything about nightmares in Gavaudon?",""
"55049764-4-5983","Carelessness can poison any victory.",""
"55049764-4-5984","Saintsport is south of here, across the bay. Mind the Sea Drakes. They'll tear your head off as soon as they look at you.",""
"55049764-4-5985","You got some lucky hits.",""
"55049764-4-5987","Thank you for not giving him the pouch of moon-sugar candy. That stuff got us into this mess in the first place.nnPlease, can I have it? I'm going to end this once and for all.",""
"55049764-4-5990","Your dueling performance was acceptable. Just barely.",""
"55049764-4-5995","You're on the quest!",""
"55049764-4-5996","You're on the quest!",""
"55049764-4-6001","Thanks for breaking me out back there.nnListen, while you're in a heroic mood, want to help me get something I left with the Goblins?",""
"55049764-4-6011","I cannot wait to leave this place. Too many eyes in the trees, in the grass, and even in the water.",""
"55049764-4-6012","You look like the strong sort. Care to help out an enterprising Dunmer, like myself?",""
"55049764-4-6014","Don't worry. We're not erecting a guillotine to start executing citizens willy-nilly.nnIt's just a deterrent. The Supernal Dreamers are trying to recruit people all over Stormhaven. This might remind them why joining would be a bad idea.",""
"55049764-4-6032","My poor cousin. Always going on about goblins. Goblins did this, goblins did that—I knew it would end badly.",""
"55049764-4-6039","Thank the Tribunal that's over. Please cut me free.",""
"55049764-4-6041","What did you decide about the relic?",""
"55049764-4-6042","I'm impressed. You smuggled Jakarn out from under Bhosek's nose. He's a charmer, isn't he?",""
"55049764-4-6045","No time to waste. Find that relic!",""
"55049764-4-6046","Go away.",""
"55049764-4-6051","What's that in your hand there?",""
"55049764-4-6065","<<1>> will probably be wanting to boss you around some more. Best go make her happy, I suppose.",""
"55049764-4-6066","Go … Hallowed. Get her out of here.",""
"55049764-4-6067","Thank Auri-El, a competent soul! Good to see you again. You'd think that I'd be used to working with him, but ….",""
"55049764-4-6068","<<1>> will pay for what he's done to my sister! I swear it!",""
"55049764-4-6069","We're grateful for your help. Our families know the risk of living with us. I've warned them about this situation before, but some soldiers don't understand the price of combat.",""
"55049764-4-6070","Ready for the fun part?",""
"55049764-4-6071","I think they soiled themselves when they saw me. It's hard to differentiate that smell from their natural musk.",""
"55049764-4-6072","You just wait. Captain Kaleen will have us back on the high seas in no time.",""
"55049764-4-6078","If you seek passage, know that this ship has no crew. Our captain is ashore, recruiting.",""
"55049764-4-6083","The withered stalk flowers again. It is good to see you, alive and well.",""
"55049764-4-6084","The ocean is my toilet!",""
"55049764-4-6094","Hello again, partner! Don't worry about what this little priest said. Hand over the goods.",""
"55049764-4-6095","Do not listen to him. He is a thief!",""
"55049764-4-6099","Uncle Ezzag will be grateful for the help, even if he does not show it.nnIf he is surly, please do not fault him. He is really a good man at heart.",""
"55049764-4-6101","How's it going with the chickens?",""
"55049764-4-6110","Bright moons guide your path. Keep your eyes open for Raz, too. No doubt he's found some valuable information, as well.",""
"55049764-4-6111","I hope you found the seeds. Without them, a lot of people will be hungry soon.",""
"55049764-4-6112","There it is! Beautiful isn't it? In its own way.",""
"55049764-4-6117","Bright moons light your path, my new friend! Clanmother manages town business from her office at home. nnYou cannot miss it, the largest building in town.",""
"55049764-4-6120","Goblins. They're gonna kill us all!",""
"55049764-4-6123","Shuzura has heard you have been all over town, yes? Tazia has told this one of your exploits, your work. A great help to S'ren-ja you have been.",""
"55049764-4-6124","Raz feels he should say … ahem. He should say his farewells. Do not worry, my friend. This one will not hold his death against you.",""
"55049764-4-6126","Kalari is a sweet girl, and my brother loved her so … hmmph. Help her, if you can.",""
"55049764-4-6127","I'm looking forward to getting back to the open seas.",""
"55049764-4-6128","The items you returned are bringing back my memory. Drinking less is helping too.nnI'll see you at the docks when you're ready to leave Stros M'Kai.",""
"55049764-4-6130","<<1>>? What've you done to him? Brother, we're getting out of here! <<1>>!",""
"55049764-4-6135","Beatiful day, isn't it? I wonder when the sun is going down today…",""
"55049764-4-6138","Until the Pact controls Drakelowe Keep, it is not safe for you in Cropsford.",""
"55049764-4-6150","The relic, ours at last! For the Covenant!",""
"55049764-4-6151","Pilgrim, be careful down here. My brethren are not themselves. Perhaps you should return to our camp? It's much safer there.",""
"55049764-4-6155","We threw them back, that's all I know. You want to know more, talk to Lambur or Chief Tazgol.",""
"55049764-4-6156","I should find a way to administer this plant sap to <<1>> as soon as possible. He's not looking to good.",""
"55049764-4-6163","Please hurry. I feel like I need a bath every time I spot that little beast.",""
"55049764-4-6179","Good job breaking up the Red Rook-Bloodthorn alliance. That should make things a little easier for those of us out here in the field.",""
"55049764-4-6183","We're so close. If you can finish Sternis Gelves, the Red Rooks will scatter to the hills.nnAnd then, maybe the souls of those lost in Eagle's Brook will rest easier.",""
"55049764-4-6187","You have returned my people to their rest. I wish to repay you, but I have only information to give.",""
"55049764-4-6191","We had to ascend the cliff behind you and still beat you here. Try to keep up.nnThough the scouts say you handled the second Stone quite well.",""
"55049764-4-6197","The prophecies of the Elder Scrolls are a fluid, living thing. They are not fixed. At many points throughout history, the actions of heroic mortals have rewritten them.",""
"55049764-4-6198","All of us feel much better knowing a brave traveler seeks the Claw.",""
"55049764-4-6207","The Bloody Hand is just a small tribe, fortunately. I fear that Goblins will someday band together and wipe out Cropsford. I hope that day is far in the future.",""
"55049764-4-6208","I don't like this at all, you understand?nnI'm doing this for the Daggers and their families. That's all.",""
"55049764-4-6209","Chief Tazgol must know of your discoveries before he marches on Carzog's Demise. We have ignored the Bloodthorn threat for too long. It may already be too late.",""
"55049764-4-6212","Find my brother and get him to return that egg before he winds up getting hurt. Or worse.",""
"55049764-4-6218","You're making good progress. We've pushed forward this far due to your help. It won't be long before we can retake the rest of the area.",""
"55049764-4-6220","I suspected something like this. It explains what we've seen. The Shade of Naemon does not seek destruction—it seeks transformation. We need to close these shadow rifts quickly. nnFirst though, I promised their souls release.",""
"55049764-4-6222","How can I supply the ship if the Orcs refuse to trade? Does the Captain expect miracles? Well, I do work miracles. With gold. But even Syrabane would need his ring to get these Orcs to talk!",""
"55049764-4-6225","Look, another driftwood washed up from the shore.  I'm Tazgol's forge-wife, so I mine the ore and shape the steel on this island.",""
"55049764-4-6226","What is it? Speak up or move on.",""
"55049764-4-6227","Staring is a good way to lose your eyes.",""
"55049764-4-6233","You smell of ashes. Does that mean you burned Talmo's banner?",""
"55049764-4-6235","Hallowed … you have come, as Hunal saw reflected on the moons last night, yes?nThe city of Dune shall be made whole in your passing, and our people will praise your name for years to come.",""
"55049764-4-6236","Don't interrupt me! It's your fault I have to do this, so I'd just as soon get it over with!",""
"55049764-4-6240","She's been hit with an arrow. You remove the arrow while I hold her down. She might swing at you.",""
"55049764-4-6241","Well, don't drag your feet.  This endeavor has wasted too much of my time already.",""
"55049764-4-6243","I'm certain the cook bambedazzled me! But a bet's a bet.",""
"55049764-4-6247","How will I ever get it back? I cannot live without my lute!",""
"55049764-4-6251","Oh look, more gloom and death.",""
"55049764-4-6252","We have to find Sai Sahan. He knows where the Amulet of Kings is, and he doesn't deserve to suffer at the hands of that sniveling, knife-eared, puddle of troll piss.",""
"55049764-4-6253","The Orcs are being routed by a spirit army. The Bloodthorns have tapped into a power I've never seen before.",""
"55049764-4-6254","Speak of the poison to no one.",""
"55049764-4-6255","Never been in ruins this old before. Bet there's some good stuff just lying around, free for the taking.",""
"55049764-4-6257","That relic … such power. I can feel it from here.",""
"55049764-4-6261","I can't belive you gave Marius the poison.",""
"55049764-4-6266","Good to meet you. This one is honored to be working alongside the Champion. Our next Mane!",""
"55049764-4-6269","Several survivors made it here while you were gone. All said you rescued them.",""
"55049764-4-6276","So it's really come to this? Knights of the Flame killing each other? I agree with Sir Edmund, but I'm not willing to go that far.",""
"55049764-4-6285","Act quickly, decisively. The Claw is so close.",""
"55049764-4-6286","Good luck to you, traveler. This one can feel the Bright Moons whisper to her. She feels you will succeed.",""
"55049764-4-6288","Some weren't happy with your decision to keep the relic, but I whole-heartedly support you.",""
"55049764-4-6292","She led us here … Khali led us to the threshold. Hallowed, I … I've never been afraid like this before. But I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I can take the last step.",""
"55049764-4-6301","Dune is clear, the city is safe. The Lunar Champion is here. Are you ready to help her walk the Two Moons Path?",""
"55049764-4-6317","I hope this Path you have to walk will not be troubled by the darkness plaguing Dune.",""
"55049764-4-6318","Destruction. Devastation. Our Dominion does not deserve this treatment.",""
"55049764-4-6319","Kazargi is in there. Watch over her. She is very dear to me, young though she is.",""
"55049764-4-6328","Please don't bother me.  This warding spell is quite complex, and if I don't finish it soon, there will be nothing to stop the impending invasion.",""
"55049764-4-6332","I am Hermaeus-Mora. The riddle unsolvable. The door unopenable. The book unreadable. The question unanswerable. nnI wonder if you understand why you're here.",""
"55049764-4-6335","If you are able to, bring Asteril back here if you catch her. This one would very much like to ask her some questions himself.",""
"55049764-4-6337","From what you discovered, it's unquestionable at this point—the Veiled Heritance is planning something here, something even worse than killing the queen.nnI just hope it's not too late for us to stop them.",""
"55049764-4-6339","You and the keystone are now one. Its power resides within you.",""
"55049764-4-6340","I hope I haven't given you a sense of false hope though. Bosmer 'round here petition the Wilderking for an audience all the time, and he rarely responds.nnMore than likely, you're simply wasting your time.",""
"55049764-4-6342","This entrance is blocked. I sent soldiers inside to try to clear it.",""
"55049764-4-6362","Get back on your boat. You're not welcome here.",""
"55049764-4-6363","Whoa! Where in Oblivion did you come from? The boat? Did you just dodge past all those walking dead?nnIf you told me you killed a few of them, I wouldn't blame you. I might even thank you. Anything would help right now.",""
"55049764-4-6364","You made it. Excellent! Now that we're inside, there's something you should know about me.",""
"55049764-4-6367","Garnikh is a troll when he's injured.",""
"55049764-4-6372","Who knows how long <<1>>'s imposter fooled us all.",""
"55049764-4-6374","This isn't the best place for outlanders. Best move along.",""
"55049764-4-6378","I just hope the Ash'abah are prepared for this.nnRegardless, I will discreetly begin looking through the ranks for any soldiers who might be willing to do what's necessary. That way, at least we have someone.",""
"55049764-4-6382","I hope that's the magister's blood I see on your clothes.",""
"55049764-4-6392","Soon we'll be off again. I'll miss those who are leaving, but it's their choice.",""
"55049764-4-6395","The Shadowscales want the Fangs of Sithis. There are so many of them!nnBut they're dangerous. The Fangs in the hands of assassins? I can't imagine anything worse.",""
"55049764-4-6397","The portal will return you to the surface. Dar-m'Athra still lurk within the temple, but their presence will fade in time.",""
"55049764-4-6408","Like the branches of a Graht Oak, I believe that Aranias' destiny, my destiny, and your destiny are all intertwined. nnI cannot yet see how these events will play out, but I do know that like Aranias, you must come deeper into the forest.",""
"55049764-4-6409","Ahh, it's good to have a cool ale in my hand again. Such a bad day!",""
"55049764-4-6410","Easy, now. Don't kill the only ally you have in this camp. I just want to talk.",""
"55049764-4-6415","Foolish <<1>>. Will I ever see him again?",""
"55049764-4-6421","I've never seen a guardian fight like that! Incredible! You really know how to choose a champion!",""
"55049764-4-6422","You released him—I think that was the right thing to do. nnSince you already freed the villagers' spirits from the Shadow Wood, that means all the spirits here can now be at rest. We've done a good thing here.",""
"55049764-4-6423","And who in Oblivion are you? Some Daedric illusion?",""
"55049764-4-6424","You have more bothersome questions? Dulan has more races to announce. Go away, before this one loses his patience and tells <<1>> of your meddling.",""
"55049764-4-6429","Enter this Lightless Oubliette. Draw upon the Light of Meridia to protect you. It can disrupt the darkness that shall seek to slow you down.nnThen move the crystals to gain access to my prison. This strategy shall succeed. I am certain of it!",""
"55049764-4-6436","If you want to make any final preparations or rescue any others, I recommend you take care of those tasks before you enter the cathedral.",""
"55049764-4-6437","You fly like the wind and hurl like a giant! If you would consider a career in spikeball, this one would be pleased to be your manager.",""
"55049764-4-6440","Look, there he is! I'll follow your lead.",""
"55049764-4-6441","Don't look at me, I didn't get the door open.",""
"55049764-4-6442","High steps! Come on!",""
"55049764-4-6444","The Elder Scroll of Mnem was entrusted to the Dominion's care. We have failed the gods if we do not bring it back. Help us recover it!",""
"55049764-4-6445","The treethane may be correct in her suspicion that there is a spy in our midst, but I can assure you with all that he or she is not from within the ranks of the Thalmor.",""
"55049764-4-6447","A Dremora wants to help us? It has to be another trick. Be careful of that one.",""
"55049764-4-6448","Ezreba prays for forgiveness. She hopes the light of Jone and Jode will absolve her.",""
"55049764-4-6453","Thank you. And thank you for saving my Ganny. I don't … I don't know what I'd do without her.",""
"55049764-4-6456","The outsider has returned.",""
"55049764-4-6457","This place sure got to Captain Arakh. I've never seen anyone so paranoid before.",""
"55049764-4-6458","Khaba is done with your questions. Move along now. Your pestering makes her back arch.",""
"55049764-4-6464","So, you have come to take the Trial of the Spirit?",""
"55049764-4-6474","Targoth! With you here, I know the Bretons on the surface have been overrun. Good.",""
"55049764-4-6478","So, did you put Minwe down?",""
"55049764-4-6480","Targoth! The Breton King has sealed himself deeper in the ruin. He is preparing some foul spell!",""
"55049764-4-6482","It's amazing to think Ezreba was involved in all this. She's such a part of this community.",""
"55049764-4-6483","Never crack your ribs. Like someone stabs your lungs with needles.nnFrom inside your lungs.",""
"55049764-4-6485","Damn it! As much as I want to slaughter those Sea Viper bastards, they'll swarm over this ship the moment we leave for that island.nnWe'll keep this ship safe. Go, avenge <<1>>. Kill every last one of them.",""
"55049764-4-6486","Don't worry about me. I'll find my way soon enough. The gods wouldn't see me through a hurricane to end my life here.",""
"55049764-4-6487","Fate wasn't kind to us. I've never seen a hurricane pick up so fast.",""
"55049764-4-6506","Other towns have rats or squirrels or cats. We've got bears.",""
"55049764-4-6509","Give me a moment to prepare myself. Go on ahead, I'll be right behind you.",""
"55049764-4-6510","Give me a moment to collect myself. I'll be right behind you.",""
"55049764-4-6514","The Prowler's down two sailors because of those fish-Elves.nnWould've been three, if it weren't for <<1>>'s nimble feet. She can climb rigging like she's running to the top.",""
"55049764-4-6515","Gadris is upset because we had to hide behind some rocks. Undignified, he said. Well, Zur says that being eaten by a deformed creature is even more undignified.",""
"55049764-4-6543","I wished no ill upon the man, but if the Divines will my freedom in such a way, I will not question them.",""
"55049764-4-6586","Greenhill has survived. Thank you. I'm certain we'd all be in their icy grip if it hadn't been for you.",""
"55049764-4-6590","Best not to mention our methods. It will only bring questions and hard feelings, yes?",""
"55049764-4-6591","My people rejoice! Most consider us monsters, but you helped us. We will never forget your generosity and compassion. My egg sisters will live! And life, even in this wretched place, is precious. Thank you!",""
"55049764-4-6593","My friend, I trust you to see this done. Go well.",""
"55049764-4-6594","Speak to Cariel, my new friend. She'll be taking charge from here. I have to see to the wounded and begin the monumental task of returning Arenthia to rights.",""
"55049764-4-6596","Lorkhan take them all! Why does <<c:1>> negotiate with these filthy Maormer?",""
"55049764-4-6597","Be gentle when you speak with <<1>>. She has been through much, and fears for her friends.",""
"55049764-4-6599","What's done is done. I pray future dealings with the Dominion won't end in bloodshed.",""
"55049764-4-6600","The pain was unbearable. Like something tried to crack my skull open!",""
"55049764-4-6601","This apothecary must have had a hand in the murder. I'll get it out of him, one way or another.",""
"55049764-4-6602","Out of my way!",""
"55049764-4-6607","Perhaps I'll see you in the ring. Doubtful, but I suppose anything's possible.",""
"55049764-4-6609","Don't flinch, and don't let them see you sweat.",""
"55049764-4-6610","Zara wishes you luck. You are going to need it.",""
"55049764-4-6614","Congratulations, Mysterious Stranger. You are the Sorcerer Division Champion!",""
"55049764-4-6615","Apparently, he wants to talk to you now. Some insanity about the health of the forest and his directives. nnI respect the Green Pact as much as the next Bosmer, but what he's talking about is something else entirely. Don't listen to him.",""
"55049764-4-6618","Did you … did you succeed?",""
"55049764-4-6619","If anyone pays you to haul kwama eggs during a hurricane, spit in their eye.nnBy the gods, the mess! The yelling, the smell … and that was just the sailors.",""
"55049764-4-6622","Search <<1>>. There must be some sign of <<2>>.",""
"55049764-4-6629","Welcome back. You were gone for longer than I expected.nnI trust you walked beside Prince Haqmir of Yath and experienced the events that led to his exile?",""
"55049764-4-6635","Now it's time to bring down their champion. She should be in one of the larger caves.nnWe bring her head back and my people will have to see you.",""
"55049764-4-6636","It is done. <<1>> is finally dead.nnWe should leave this place before his puppets come calling.",""
"55049764-4-6637","It was a mistake to remove this one from his home in the shadow realm.nnThis one will tear a hole in you and drink its fill.",""
"55049764-4-6640","I don't believe it! This is Rkugamz! The abandoned city!",""
"55049764-4-6647","You are not welcome here, outsider. You may visit our camp, but do not tarry near the chief's tent.",""
"55049764-4-6653","Talia … Talia? Is that you? I-I'm … so dizzy ….",""
"55049764-4-6660","If I never see another Dwemer construct, I'll die happy.",""
"55049764-4-6661","My captured companions are locked in the cells beneath the Hall of Judgment. The door to the holding cells is across the way.",""
"55049764-4-6663","We were separated from the bulk of our fleet in the storm. We washed up here, and the others … well, we believe they washed up farther up shore.",""
"55049764-4-6667","Get into the drinking tents and set some fires. Kill anyone that tries to stop you.nnCause enough commotion and Ren'dro's men will come running. Then make for the compound.",""
"55049764-4-6672","No entry without permission. Get out of here.",""
"55049764-4-6674","You do realize that more watchers will replace these creatures. Killing them is a futile gesture. nnStill, far be it for me to curtail your enjoyment.",""
"55049764-4-6675","Don't listen to this fool's words. The forbidden tomes must be destroyed. Place them in the shrine's flame, quickly!",""
"55049764-4-6678","If we don't close the portal from the other side, the Daedra will find a way to re-open it.",""
"55049764-4-6681","I must consider <<Ac:1>>'s possibilities. First, to determine if the water is indeed infinite.nnEr, do you mind? I must focus on my work.",""
"55049764-4-6684","Welcome to Eagle's Strand, my friend. You have returned to help Razum-dar in his time of need!",""
"55049764-4-6686","You have the books? Then luck truly favors my path!nnDo not listen to the lying spirit. This knowledge should be preserved by one who knows how. By this I mean, <<1>> knows.",""
"55049764-4-6688","Destroy the Sigil-trees and slay Sangur.",""
"55049764-4-6689","The rats are gone. If his conscience allows it, our inspector lets us continue our way of life. All is well.",""
"55049764-4-6697","You know at first, this wild magic and the seals here seemed completely incomprehensible, but I think I understand how it works now.nnIn fact, I think I'll poke around here for a little bit before I leave.",""
"55049764-4-6701","Well, what are you waiting for? Open the rest of the cages, if you please.",""
"55049764-4-6702","It took a bit of work, but we finally stabilized the portals. Our people aren't getting scattered hither and yon every time they travel to Coldharbour any more.nnAt least, not as long as they're traveling to the Hollow City.",""
"55049764-4-6703","The city is coming along nicely, don't you think? I'm not sure if we would have made it this far if not for your help.nnThank you.",""
"55049764-4-6705","We've made it but I fear for my brother. I think the Daedric fire burned him more fiercely than it did me.",""
"55049764-4-6706","Atronach parts are best, but any old meat will do. We can improvise.",""
"55049764-4-6729","You are a competitor? Ishalga thought you came to the arena to pick up the rubbish!",""
"55049764-4-6733","Thank ye for restoring the bushes. But the Orcs' destruction reaches farther than I'd expected.",""
"55049764-4-6734","I saw you scurrying around this plantation. I know you're running skooma.nnTell me who you work for, or you'll end up in a cell!",""
"55049764-4-6735","My father is dead, and now this Dominion outsider wants to throw me in prison!nnThey say they found evidence of skooma in the storehouses, but that's impossible!",""
"55049764-4-6737","I'm more concerned with the lack of trees out there than the lack of seeds in here.",""
"55049764-4-6738","We await our companions who have gone inside the ruin. nnIf you wish to know more, speak to the priestess.",""
"55049764-4-6740","Mara bless you, child. Tread with care. We're from the Chapel in Bravil, north over the border. A gang of bandits broke in and stole our holiest relics. It's not safe here.",""
"55049764-4-6747","This is <<1>>'s lodge. You can't enter without permission.",""
"55049764-4-6749","Try the weapons, walker!",""
"55049764-4-6753","Bright moons and sharp claws, thank you!",""
"55049764-4-6756","Nice work out there. Now that we've prepared all of the spell components, I can finish performing the ritual.nnThe threat these vampires pose will soon be over.",""
"55049764-4-6757","Everyone has gathered for the ceremony, and now with your arrival we are ready to begin.",""
"55049764-4-6761","Even if it was a simple spell, it's a simple spell well done.",""
"55049764-4-6766","Yes? What is it?",""
"55049764-4-6773","Know that you have made an enemy this day, mortal. I will stop you. The Elf's ritual shall not succeed!",""
"55049764-4-6789","Those men and women worked with my father. <<1>> used to cook for us. She'd even stew vegetables, when we asked nicely.",""
"55049764-4-6790","My blade has tasted the blood of my mother's killer. I should feel happy, righteous … but I don't feel anything.",""
"55049764-4-6791","I see you found additional help. Not that we need it, but a little extra protection can't hurt.",""
"55049764-4-6794","Aranias must not meet the Veiled Heritance alone, if we're to help her.nnGo to the lighthouse, and thereafter to the manor to watch her past. By then, she'll be waiting for you in the garden.",""
"55049764-4-6800","If anyone can get to the bottom of this, it's you and Aelif. She went for a walk to get some air. I think you'll find her near the docks. Stendarr guard your steps, my friend.",""
"55049764-4-6804","How much longer must we pretend? My daughter wails in disappointment and our two families verge on coming to blows!nnThere is nothing to be done for it! The groom is not coming!",""
"55049764-4-6805","This future only exists if the Lunar Champion is not successful on her path. She is the hope of the Dominion to come, and you are the hope for her. There is one last step along the path, if you are ready to conclude your journey.",""
"55049764-4-6806","Here is the Staff of Magnus. As you can see, we have kept it quite well protected.",""
"55049764-4-6810","Don't worry, we'll be fine. We'll pack up with the Mercs, and get out of here as soon as we can.",""
"55049764-4-6811","It is not an easy task I ask of you, I understand. Take your time, but know the fate of the Militia rides on your shoulders.",""
"55049764-4-6815","Don't worry about me, I'll get gone as soon as the coast is clear!",""
"55049764-4-6816","So is saving people from terrible situations a hobby of yours?",""
"55049764-4-6817","I decided that I liked my hair just the way it is.",""
"55049764-4-6818","I have spells to prepare. If you must speak, you should do so with Warlock Carindon.",""
"55049764-4-6820","The Mages here are doing important work. Warlock Carindon keeps us on a taxing schedule.",""
"55049764-4-6821","I'm busy.",""
"55049764-4-6822","I won't forgive those Bosmer for what they did to Patraud. An Altmer would never ….nnThis is unforgiveable.",""
"55049764-4-6824","Long way from the Mages Guild.nnWarlock Carindon speaks for us. You should see him if you have an issue.",""
"55049764-4-6826","Fancy meeting you here. Don't suppose my uncle sent you, did he?",""
"55049764-4-6830","What is it? Yuck! Its bones are on the inside!",""
"55049764-4-6831","Explore the forest. The mages and I will see to this prisoner.",""
"55049764-4-6832","Fair winds and blessings, wayfarer. nnWar may come between Crown and Forebearer eventually, but thanks to you it shall not start in Bergama.",""
"55049764-4-6833","What you've done doesn't change anything, wayfarer. These Crown dogs will always gnaw at their lead. One day the leash will snap, and we Forebears will be waiting.",""
"55049764-4-6834","By Tava's red feathers, how wrong we were. Bergama might have sunk into the sand sea of open war had you not taken things in hand.",""
"55049764-4-6835","Thank the Green I found you!",""
"55049764-4-6836","Tu'whacca's breath, how close we came to disaster! The Withered Hand shall be severed at the wrist for this blasphemy.",""
"55049764-4-6842","I hope I don't make a fool of myself in front of everyone.",""
"55049764-4-6843","Find the relics of my people. I would add their stories to the tale.",""
"55049764-4-6847","Whatever Alasan is doing, you must stop him. nnI fear that if he succeeds in this endeavor, the future of all Alik'r is in jeopardy.",""
"55049764-4-6858","Congratulations, Hallowed. This one is not very spiritual … but even a fool knows we need a shield against the darkness. Especially when you cheat death.",""
"55049764-4-6870","Quickly, to the Prowler! Catch the Vicereeve!nnDismissed!",""
"55049764-4-6885","Finally, someone who's not running the other direction! nnI had no idea I was rubbing elbows with so many feckless cowards! A few necromancers show up and everyone jumps ship, literally! To just up and abandon this project—they should be ashamed!",""
"55049764-4-6887","My brave Zariya … I will see her exonerated, and then she will rest among our people, where she belongs.",""
"55049764-4-6898","You certainly took your time about things. Not your fault, I understand, not your fault! We may yet get this right!",""
"55049764-4-6919","Ah, the one who did not listen to Raz. He would say it is good to see you again, but this one is still sulking.",""
"55049764-4-6923","I'd stand by your side in there if I could, Hallowed. Good luck.",""
"55049764-4-6927","The Wood Elves of Valenwood stand behind you on this sacred journey, Hallowed.",""
"55049764-4-6928","This is fascinating. I can't wait to see what happens next.",""
"55049764-4-6931","I've never seen the Queen like that. She is always so strong and poised.",""
"55049764-4-6939","This is not the decision I thought you would make.",""
"55049764-4-6953","We must get to the Eldest Den. There might still be time to save it.",""
"55049764-4-6954","Nnnnn! Please … hurry! I can't hold this spell forever!",""
"55049764-4-6955","It's good you're here. With earth magic and fire, Aranias and Andur force their way towards my throne, leaving chaos in their wake.nnI've lost control of my guardians. My power fades. I've always wondered what death would be like. Soon, I will know.",""
"55049764-4-6957","I was a fool to trust the Veiled Heritance. They just used me as bait to trick the Wilderking into letting his guard down.nnAs soon as Andur realized I was having doubts, he just cast me aside. It's clear to me now—I have to stop him.",""
"55049764-4-6967","Whatever you and <<1>> are up to, it can't be good for Gudarz. nnI wish you luck.",""
"55049764-4-6968","I hope there was something helpful in the tent. I'm starting to worry about how the other villagers will react to these continued delays.",""
"55049764-4-6969","I'm delighted those ruffians finally got their comeuppance. It was about time.",""
"55049764-4-6971","This really is the most delightful brew. Being a pact-hostage is turning out to be very pleasant, really!",""
"55049764-4-6978","Collect my lady's lost jewels and meet us at the secret cave entrance.",""
"55049764-4-6981","Enter the manor and find Stibbons! You've got to hurry before it's too late!",""

"55049764-4-6985","I hear the old soldiers are about to give up hope and leave.nnCan't come too soon for me.",""
"55049764-4-6993","Our forces have gathered and are ready to move. We need to find the planar vortex and end the Planemeld once and for all.",""
"55049764-4-7005","This all seems familiar. I don't like it. I shouldn't know what a Daedric Prince's lair looks like! How can I recognize this place?nnBut don't worry. I'm not going to turn into an atronach or anything. I don't think.",""
"55049764-4-7009","Welcome to the temple at Rawl'kha, Moon Hallowed.",""
"55049764-4-7015","I can't imagine we have too much farther to go. We just need to cross this region and we'll find the planar vortex in no time.",""
"55049764-4-7027","You're still alive? Quick, get me out of here!",""
"55049764-4-7029","Morwha's bosom, I'm glad to be out of that place. I want to see the lights of Sentinel!nn<<1>> and I will make a great team. This is the kind of matchmaking for me.",""
"55049764-4-7035","An impressive dowry, don't you agree? Worthy of my precious daughter.nn<<1>> advised me to place it in a chest at the base of our entry tunnel. I've sent a guard to keep watch over it.",""
"55049764-4-7039","Indaenir believes he can enter unharmed. And you as well. I pray he's right.",""
"55049764-4-7042","Finally. I thought perhaps you'd gotten lost. nnWe must be cautious down here.",""
"55049764-4-7043","Could it be true? Me. The Silvenar?",""
"55049764-4-7044","Hold up. Imperial forces have seized control of Satakalaam. nnI'd stay away, unless of course, you want to volunteer and help King Fahara'jad's army take the city back from these bastards.",""
"55049764-4-7046","Did you talk to the villagers?",""
"55049764-4-7058","Good luck, friend. But with <<1>> by your side, you shouldn't have much trouble.",""
"55049764-4-7066","Have you found Pariel? Please, don't stop looking.",""
"55049764-4-7068","Be at ease. The mercenaries dare not enter my home uninvited.nnI watched you long before you spoke to my father, <<1>>. You spoke to people in town, and listened to their answers. Are you actually interested in helping?",""
"55049764-4-7070","There has to be a way into those tunnels.nnI've fought enough smugglers to know how they think. We should search the buildings near the cliffs.",""
"55049764-4-7071","This cave seems rather important to <<1>>. Perhaps there's another entrance near the cliff walls?",""
"55049764-4-7075","The Chasm is secured, we have control of the portals and the gatehouse. We couldn't have done this without you. Thanks!",""
"55049764-4-7081","The Chief is gravely ill. I fear Tu'whacca may claim him soon.",""
"55049764-4-7082","May the Green bring our paths together once more, friend.",""
"55049764-4-7098","I took only a sip before they stopped me. Empty your water skin and move on, O wayfarer. It is not safe here.",""
"55049764-4-7101","What do you want, ugly?",""
"55049764-4-7108","Scurry off, little mortal, but heed my words.nnControlling the Citadel, while useful, is not enough. Not for where you must ultimately go. But we shall talk more of this later, provided you survive.",""
"55049764-4-7109","The Reaver Citadel. It's all that stands between us and the portal to the planar vortex. nnIf King Dynar doesn't give the order to attack soon, I may just have to do this without him.",""
"55049764-4-7112","No one's allowed in Verrant Morass right now. The Vinedusk Rangers are investigating a strange blight.",""
"55049764-4-7113","Don't worry, I'm working up to writing those papers. I work best when I'm under pressure. You'll see!",""
"55049764-4-7115","Go ahead, try the lodestone on the <<m:1>>. I'm certain you'll be fine.nnNearly certain. Sixty percent certain! Conservatively.",""
"55049764-4-7118","If it weren't for you, I'd be well and truly buried right now. You're a real friend.",""
"55049764-4-7119","Please don't make this more difficult than it has to be. The only way for our spirits to reach Tamriel again is for you to die.",""
"55049764-4-7122","You humble me with your courage. Thanks to you, the other strongholds may learn what happened here.",""
"55049764-4-7123","We can speak later. Help us defend the barrier!",""
"55049764-4-7125","Khajiit is nervous. This one has never returned from the dead before.",""
"55049764-4-7139","What can I get for you? I have goods from the March and into Valenwood!",""
"55049764-4-7141","Sorry, but I can't chat. Tholbor's given me an arm's length of tasks to do, including his filthy laundry. Horrible man, honestly.",""
"55049764-4-7142","Sorry, I'm all out of sorts. Malarel has a thousand tasks for me, and her idea of motivation is a lightning bolt to the forehead. I understand I'm the third assistant she's had in a month!",""
"55049764-4-7144","The Eight watch over you. We lost a lot of good soldiers to the corruption. I pray Indaenir is right about you.",""
"55049764-4-7145","Be careful in there. No one can say what may lie within. I hope Indaenir is safe.",""
"55049764-4-7147","Hurry. We must inform the Queen.",""
"55049764-4-7148","While at first we thought only the Bosmer may be affected, we quickly realized the minds of others were in jeopardy as well. nnIndaenir said there is something special about you. We pray he is right.",""
"55049764-4-7149","Shazah worries for the people here. Mane Akkhuz-ri brought us to learn and assist, but sadly, there was nothing to be done.",""
"55049764-4-7150","Khali is but a student of the Mane, but this one longs to be inside and undo this corruption.",""
"55049764-4-7151","There's no end to the depravity of the Veiled Heritance.",""
"55049764-4-7154","It's a little bit like watching a fairy tale come true.",""
"55049764-4-7156","Auri-El watch over you. The queen, the mane, and Indaenir have all chosen to put their faith in you. I hope they are right.",""
"55049764-4-7157","This isn't the place for Khali and Shaza. So close to this corruption when they should be learning of their future roles.",""
"55049764-4-7158","You certainly fight like you've done this before.nnWe have one more front to clear, and then we'll be free to help the others at the central barrier.",""
"55049764-4-7159","Laeneval will not be forgotten. Let's make sure her death is not in vain.nnMy bow is yours, if you need it.",""
"55049764-4-7160","To all things, there is a beginning and an end. Remember this.",""
"55049764-4-7161","There must be another way into the caves. Perhaps there's a passage near the cliff walls?",""
"55049764-4-7194","Any luck? Or are they still at an impasse?",""
"55049764-4-7208","Damn it all! I can't believe you're finding me like this again! It was humiliating enough the last time!nnThere's no time for jests, though. The Withered Hand has stolen back the Ansei Wards we recovered! They have all three again!",""
"55049764-4-7214","Speak to them. Make them see reason!",""
"55049764-4-7225","Imagine, a fortress full of Dremora! We'll have a jolly good time storming these walls!nnI wonder if we shouldn't have dismissed the Dremora lass so quickly, though. When they go out of their way to talk, I find it's usually a good idea to listen.",""
"55049764-4-7228","Now comes the time to prove yourself, <<1>>.nnYour strength and wisdom is needed elsewhere in Alik'r.",""
"55049764-4-7229","You have the look of a hunter about you. But the Senche demands that you act the part.",""
"55049764-4-7230","Remember, just play the flute and you'll hear an echo from Erinel's counterpart.  Please save my betrothed!",""
"55049764-4-7231","Maybe next time Grunda will serve a proper tea when guests arrive. I mean, really! The social graces are simply beyond some people.",""
"55049764-4-7232","Who are you? What are you doing here? You need to get out before the others return from their raid!",""
"55049764-4-7233","So much blood. The cries. I can still hear them. Oh Divines, so much pain.",""
"55049764-4-7235","I will see to the Hunt-Wife and the torturer. You must see to the son and the Hearth-Wife.nnMake them scream.",""
"55049764-4-7239","That, my friend, is the question of the day! We wish we knew, but we're no experts on evil wards and such. Well, at least not those of us here.nnHowever, seeing as how whatever business you had here will need to wait, we could use your help.",""
"55049764-4-7296","Everyone in Marbruk is jumpy over the recent thefts. The Artisan is a crafty one.",""
"55049764-4-7305","If you need banking services, my master Talqua can assist you downstairs.",""
"55049764-4-7313","You come to me with an empty belly, yes? Let Duzal fix you something.",""
"55049764-4-7323","It's an honor to have had you fighting on our side. I know the king will want to recognize you as well … when the time is right.nnUntil then, I wish you great luck and clear roads.",""
"55049764-4-7325","We must remain vigilant. I don't know what's gone wrong, but it's clear that something has upset the boss, <<1>>.nnJust a guess, but I bet it's all these spiders.",""
"55049764-4-7330","It's really for the best.",""
"55049764-4-7333","This one welcomes you to her home. She is sorry, Kala is in no mood to chat. Her brother has been gone for many days now.",""
"55049764-4-7341","Not now.",""
"55049764-4-7343","Please don't interrupt us.",""
"55049764-4-7344","Excuse me, we're in a meeting.",""
"55049764-4-7369","Oh, hello there. Sorry, was the music bothering you?",""
"55049764-4-7374","Ah, not here to bet, then. Good. Good!nnThis one wishes to see you hurting, but more, to see those you fight dying. There is no victory without pain, walker. No spotless wins. Remember that and shed much blood.",""
"55049764-4-7407","Scouts bring rumors of a new power in the land. A Wilderqueen, a woman who can change the land beneath our feet. I also hear she served the Veiled Heritance—until you turned her.nnThank you. Even if she isn't with us, she's also not against us.",""
"55049764-4-7408","If you are looking for evidence, I'd suggest looking around in town. When the forest turned against us, there was no time for anyone to collect their belongings—or cover their tracks.",""
"55049764-4-7411","You are just as bad as them. You are only doing this because I'm an outsider, a Khajiit.",""
"55049764-4-7412","You did the right thing, advocate. <<1>> was a blight on our community, and you see how we've blossomed without his presence.",""
"55049764-4-7423","So, going toe-to-toe with the big bad then, are you? Smashing! Good luck to you! nnThis whole Planemeld thing seems like a nasty business. I prefer my Coldharbour with a bit less Tamriel in it, thank you very much!",""
"55049764-4-7428","Yes?",""
"55049764-4-7430","She led us here … Shazah led us to the threshold. Hallowed … I've never been afraid like this before. But I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I can take the last step.",""
"55049764-4-7432","She says she wants to kill us, but she doesn't mean it. She says that out of love.",""
"55049764-4-7437","Man the ballistae! Stop that thing before it rams us again!",""
"55049764-4-7440","Look out for evidence of the mammoth's path, and good luck!",""
"55049764-4-7443","Be careful. The oldest bones in the Barrowbough can be a bit … well, moody isn't exactly the word. But yes, moody.",""
"55049764-4-7445","So the Spinner was innocent after all? I don't know how I could've been so mistaken, but honestly, I'm relieved.nnThe Spinner's role is a vital one. If he'd betrayed us, it would have injured us twice over.",""
"55049764-4-7447","I still think Gathiel must have had some part of this, but I guess the evidence speaks.",""
"55049764-4-7451","So, you've heard the masters speak. Snake, Tiger, Wolf—these are the spirits of the hunt. Each Briar embraces the qualities of one of these spirits.nnAre you still interested in joining the Briars?",""
"55049764-4-7452","Get out of my way. I'm going to kill Pellingare myself. All you have to do is look the other way.",""
"55049764-4-7453","Something's wrong. I've never known Pellingare to run from help. We need to follow him.",""
"55049764-4-7454","It won't matter, you know, if the courts spare me. I'll just find another way to end it.nnI admire your compassion. Perhaps one day your children will turn out better than mine.",""
"55049764-4-7457","Don't think I'm not watching you, just because my eyes are closed. I may be old and tired, but I am not unaware.",""
"55049764-4-7461","It feels good to be whole and strong again. You shall see my true power now that I've recovered from the soul-meld.nnI do miss Zur, though. He'd be beside himself at the thought of exploring a Daedric Prince's stronghold.",""
"55049764-4-7463","Ah, another visitor! You've arrived at an auspicious time for our village.nnI am Erunor of Shrouded Hollow.",""
"55049764-4-7464","Praise the Wilderking, you're alive! I knew he would save us!",""
"55049764-4-7465","I love what the Dark Prince has done with this place. Quite lovely. Shame we have to march an army through here. Soldiers rarely take care to watch where they step.",""
"55049764-4-7467","Oh, hello. I thought that maybe you were my wife. I got back from my job at the cemetery, but she wasn't here.",""
"55049764-4-7468","Lyris desires to speak with you.",""
"55049764-4-7469","It's been a long road, hasn't it? My father used to say that if you avoid all of life's abrasions, you'll never be polished enough to shine. We must be pretty damned shiny by now.",""
"55049764-4-7470","Lyris wishes to speak with you.",""
"55049764-4-7471","Titanborn wants you first. She's even more annoying when she gets impatient.",""
"55049764-4-7472","Blood and faith, Sameer! What has befallen here? nnQuickly! We must find father! Ask the vizier where he is.",""
"55049764-4-7474","Honor to you, Sera. Welcome to the Mages Guild Hall. I realize that our presence here in the temple is unconventional, but I'm afraid that our former hall was razed just recently. One does what one must, yes?nnHave you come seeking membership?",""
"55049764-4-7476","The Elder Scroll of Chim must return to the Pact. Help us recover it!",""
"55049764-4-7478","The ring, and my father's sword, lie at the back of the crypt. We must hurry.",""
"55049764-4-7488","Comrade! It is good to see you.",""
"55049764-4-7492","I'm sure I lost my Badge of Office at the tower. You must find it for me!",""
"55049764-4-7494","It is you! A pleasure. May the light of the Bright Moons bless and keep you. Why are you here?",""
"55049764-4-7495","Sorry, a little busy keeping an eye on our friends out there. Cariel will set you straight.",""
"55049764-4-7503","The guardians of the Elder Scroll of Alma Ruma must not allow the enemy to steal it ever again!",""
"55049764-4-7506","I appreciate what you did for the acolytes. They weren't prepared for any of this.nnI'm relieved <<1>> is safe, but don't tell him I said that.",""
"55049764-4-7508","There's Sai! But why is he being tormented by a shade of Abnur Tharn?",""
"55049764-4-7511","I must say, my doppelganger is remarkably handsome. Nevertheless, we should probably destroy it. Imagine the trouble it could cause if it were let loose in Tamriel! nnI know, I know … we're here to save the Redguard.",""
"55049764-4-7512","Sai Sahan lives! You've outdone yourself, Vestige.",""
"55049764-4-7513","It hurts ….",""
"55049764-4-7515","No. Not Gathiel. Oh, Gathiel, how could you have done this?",""
"55049764-4-7517","This isn't real. This is all a bad dream.",""
"55049764-4-7534","Who are you? Why have you invaded my home?",""
"55049764-4-7539","What can you tell us? It wasn't the Spinner, right? I mean, it couldn't have been. Could it?nnAlso, you'd tell me if the meat was all gone, or if the creatures had left their filth everywhere, right? Since we're friends and all.",""
"55049764-4-7540","Please, tell me you found something conclusive. Something that will sort this out so we can get back to our lives!nnThe village can never return to normal unless justice is served, you understand?",""
"55049764-4-7541","Remember Vestige, we fight for our people. We fight for Tamriel. Evil might be kept at bay for a time, but it can never be completely eradicated. What is important is that we resist it; that we fight on, and keep fighting.",""
"55049764-4-7542","We've had some crazy adventures, haven't we? But adventures are what you call them when everybody comes back alive, so maybe they've come to an end. nnI don't regret any of it, though. Not for a moment.",""
"55049764-4-7543","I see that look in your eye, Vestige, and I wonder—am I to be the one? Know that I would consider it a great honor. It would be a fine death.",""
"55049764-4-7544","We'll never be ready, so I suppose that means we're as ready as we'll ever be.",""
"55049764-4-7545","You are Pact Advocate and I trust your judgment. I only ask that you weigh the evidence carefully. Whatever you decide, our village will never be the same.",""
"55049764-4-7548","You're investigating things? Good. Leave no stone unturned, and remember … the construction of Woodhearth in Greenshade, the founding of the Daggerfall Covenant, and the invention of the steel-toed shoe are all part of their plan.",""
"55049764-4-7551","So let's see whatever it is you found. As long as we get it over with, right?",""
"55049764-4-7555","<The shrine is quiet, empty of whatever power flowed through it.>",""
"55049764-4-7556","It doesn't matter what you do to me. You'll be dead, or trapped for a thousand years!",""
"55049764-4-7557","This one needs to deal with Tarcel's wounds. Adusa will follow you shortly.nnJust keep your wits about you around Balcone. And don't do anything rash until I get there.",""
"55049764-4-7560","Did you feel that surge of power? Imagine what we could do with something strong enough to propel us between worlds.nnThe sooner we find that relic, the better.",""
"55049764-4-7561","Mortals! Show a little concern and this is the thanks you get! And where is the constable? Why isn't he here? But that is a mystery for another time.nnThe survivors are our priority. Still, these vampires … they are most unusual.",""
"55049764-4-7582","My wounds are superficial. They will heal in time. But the debt I owe you will never be erased. I am honored to call you friend.",""
"55049764-4-7583","You have it? Give it to him.nnI will watch and pray.",""
"55049764-4-7586","Z'en's price! I knew if I banged on this door long enough, somone would come.nnLook, I really need a helping hand here. Can you spring me out before the trolls come back?",""
"55049764-4-7587","Moira's Hope may be lost, but we'll survive. And we'll remember what you did for us today, my friend. You can count on that.",""
"55049764-4-7588","The sooner we get to the barn, the better. Then we can figure out how to take back the town!",""
"55049764-4-7591","Did I get hurt? I smell blood ….",""
"55049764-4-7600","Well met, traveler. What can your Queen do for you today?",""
"55049764-4-7603","Please, let's keep moving. I don't like being in the open like this.",""
"55049764-4-7609","I hope the soldiers were able to give you some indication as to the whereabouts of my sister.nnWe could certainly use her around here. She's always so calm under pressure. Please, find her for me.",""
"55049764-4-7612","I don't have the numbers to retake <<1>>. One platoon is all I'd need.",""
"55049764-4-7613","You have the scroll. Now, we can enter the cathedral and give the mayor a bigger shock than the man in the tower!",""
"55049764-4-7615","Oh, you can't seem to catch a break, can you? Chin up, just like the bridge! Adversity is the brother-in-law of propensity! As they say.",""
"55049764-4-7619","You did it, didn't you? I can sense it. Reezal-Jul is dead.nnToo bad. I wanted to be the one to end that crazy lizard's twisted existence.",""
"55049764-4-7621","We've no time to waste. Go to Sancre Tor with Sai and the others. Bring back the Amulet of Kings!",""
"55049764-4-7622","Steel yourself and enter the portal. We will follow.",""
"55049764-4-7623","The portal's open. Let's go!",""
"55049764-4-7624","The sigil geode! Do you still have it?",""
"55049764-4-7625","Shadowed Path cultists should burn in Oblivion. Have you fulfilled this contract?",""
"55049764-4-7626","You return to me alive and well. I trust the Shadowed Path has suffered at your hands.",""
"55049764-4-7627","I sent you out after those cultists, didn't I? How did things go?",""
"55049764-4-7628","You are back! I felt the shroud of the King of Worms descend over you, and I feared the worst.",""
"55049764-4-7630","Come on! Let's have at it!nnI'd rather die fighting than get turned into one of your pitiful creatures!",""
"55049764-4-7632","Tread carefully in Molag Bal's realm. You are important. The Scrolls have so named you.",""
"55049764-4-7634","My sister-in-law just lost her husband, my brother. We're both really shaken up, but I have to stay strong for her. I just wish she'd say something. She hasn't said a word since it happened.",""
"55049764-4-7635","I'm looking forward to this. I'm curious to see where Sai Sahan trained in his youth.",""
"55049764-4-7636","Lead on. Let's get the ring and be done with this place.",""
"55049764-4-7638","Excuse me, I hate to bother you, but are you from this area? Could you help me find my husband? He went off again, and I … I don't know what to do.",""
"55049764-4-7646","You could be the key to my escape.",""
"55049764-4-7697","I'm sorry, it's … I'll be useless, with all those frost trolls about. I hope you understand.nnYou be careful in those caves, would you?",""
"55049764-4-7699","You've returned! Smashing! Were you able to recover the Emerald Chalice?",""
"55049764-4-7700","Pray you are successful.",""
"55049764-4-7701","Are you waiting for the seasons to change again? Throw the hag's heart into the circle!",""

"55049764-4-8044","We're almost there! The locals spreading the word. We just need our last performer ready to go and we'll be a carnival again.",""

"55049764-4-8078","Kaleen must have a plan, but it may not be a good one. Either she's playing Naruk, or he's playing her.nnGuess we'll find out, won't we?",""
"55049764-4-8082","Since you know Kaleen, you should do the asking around. I'll see to it no one stabs you.",""
"55049764-4-8088","Thrug and Larzgug are just as implicit in this as Osgrikh. It's fitting that they die to satisfy my husband's honor.nnI think they'll appreciate it. Just like a blood price back in the stronghold.",""
"55049764-4-8091","Help me walk out of here, and then we'll deal with Naruk.",""

"55049764-4-8110","<<1>> says you're to thank for ensuring the ratification ceremony will happen without delay.",""
"55049764-4-8111","How exciting! <<1>> has done nothing but spin for generations. To think, I'll be the king who sees it work again.",""

"55049764-4-8146","Seeking to reclaim <<1>> at this point is futile.",""

"55049764-4-8317","I know you. Daggerfall. That mad plan to take on Molag Bal. Crazy.nnLet me ask you, though. If someone committed a heinous crime—slaughtering innocent people and such—could they ever be forgiven, or should they suffer for the rest of their lives?",""
"55049764-4-8318","Now that my skull's stopped pounding, I'm ready to crack someone else's. Did you find anything in that Redguard's room?nnDo we know where they're holding the hostages?",""
"55049764-4-8319","As I suggested, wonderful as Fell's Run is, you should probably keep moving and spend the night in Northpoint. They have a very cozy inn there. nnYes, and come back and visit us another time.",""
"55049764-4-8320","By Mauloch, if you don't get out of my face, I'll grind you into the dirt.",""
"55049764-4-8328","You're back? Thank the gods! The walls of this crypt are closing in on me now. Ever since I realized I might die in here. Funny how the mind does that.nnDid you find my pack though? Did you find the letter?",""
"55049764-4-8330","You've certainly done your due diligence. I really appreciate the efforts, but I had a feeling it wouldn't work.nnSome people just have no sense of duty, and I guess Martin falls into that category.",""

"55049764-4-8336","Ah, finally, reinforcements! Have you heard? Montclair has sealed the gates and taken control of Northpoint. He's locked me out of my own city!nnIf you're here to help, I won't be offended in the least.",""
"55049764-4-8341","We can discuss whatever you like. Politics. The weather. Anything at all. But after we finish this mission.",""
"55049764-4-8343","What a clever device! When you pressed the tiles in the correct order, the barriers disappeared.nnThere appear to be two exits from this chamber. I imagine they both lead to the same place. Go ahead. I want to look around a bit before I join you.",""
"55049764-4-8345","I never should have brought everyone here. I should have handled this on my own.nnYou're in danger as well. Montclair will eventually try to use you against me.",""
"55049764-4-8346","My friend, you are truly a hero worthy of song. I can't begin to express the depth of my thanks. You've done so much for me already … might I ask your advice?",""

"55049764-4-8350","Thank you for saving us. To think I … I nearly killed us all.",""
"55049764-4-8351","Damn trash! That's all it is! Let it be known that Jerine's Ironworks sells nothing but dung. They call them swords, but you can't get an edge on one of these blades to save your life.nnEven the Shornhelm Guards got better steel than this!",""
"55049764-4-8354","Adept, thank you so much for coming. I have a request, one I hope you will honor.",""
"55049764-4-8367","Don't mind Verandis. He can get this way sometimes. Especially when the stakes are so high. But I'm sure he has his reasons.",""
"55049764-4-8368","I knew you would find the chamber and open the portal.",""
"55049764-4-8369","It appears that the Serpent has gathered the bulk of his forces in the mountainous region to the north and sealed himself within.nnSo much the better. That gives us a chance to learn what we can about this threat and plan a defense.",""
"55049764-4-8372","I can use the Lorkrata text to help translate the Ayleid words carved upon the pedestals. Why don't you examine the statue by the barrier? It has an important air about it.",""
"55049764-4-8383","Too much is hidden. The burnt bones tell much, but even they are sometimes quiet. Perhaps I'm not skilled enough yet.",""
"55049764-4-8386","I hope you can help us. Please, speak to Hara.",""
"55049764-4-8406","Whoa, there, friend. What business do you have here?",""
"55049764-4-8409","Stupid lighthouse. Stupid bandits. Stupid Hagraven!nnWhy's everything spinning?",""

"55049764-4-8418","Good to see you again, friend! Believe it or not, your presence actually makes us feel better. And I know that I feel safer with you around.nnI hate to ask, but I have another task that could use your help.",""
"55049764-4-8440","What happened to the House Councilor is unforgivable. I hope you made those responsible pay for what they've done.",""
"55049764-4-8441","I hear the missing villagers have been found. Thank the Three at least some of them survived.",""
"55049764-4-8442","You know, I don't think Varon Davel is who he claims to be. But at least he took charge after the councilor disappeared.",""

"55049764-4-8455","We should never have trusted the Maulborn. It seems like the curative isn't really a curative at all. It might even be the source of the Llodos plague!",""

"55049764-4-8486","Perhaps you can be more reasonable than this Bosmer. nnThese grounds are forbidden. Allowing them to settle here would threaten the health of the Valenwood. If they do not leave, we will purge them with the forest like a destructive rot.",""

"55049764-5-3379","Well done indeed! I could almost taste their deaths. nnFrankly, those champions had exceeded their usefulness. The captives were no competition for them, and my guards refused to fight them. But you, now — such intriguing possibilities.",""

"55049764-5-3592","Be careful. There's no telling what you may find inside the warehouse. That man may have friends in there who wouldn't be happy to see you.",""
"55049764-5-3597","You're back? That bandit finally convinced me to let him help out. I hope I didn't make a mistake with my generosity.",""

"55049764-5-3714","Why … what happened? My head hurts.",""
"55049764-5-3716","That's good work, but we can't drink to it here. Darling Gabrielle can't hold this portal open for long, and I need you on the other side to pay my tavern bill.nnLet's go.",""

"55049764-5-4855","Thank you again for freeing me from those roots. I don't think I can ever look at vegetables the same way.",""
"55049764-5-4856","I felt it. A shift in the planes. Is it done?",""
"55049764-5-4859","Still on both your legs? Good. nnYou and me should get some mead sometime. Shor's stones, it's been a while.",""
"55049764-5-4860","The village! I couldn't help them! So many dead ….nnOh Z'en, what have we done?",""
"55049764-5-4867","We'll watch over Scales while the cure does its work.",""
"55049764-5-4872","What do you think? Kireth trusts you, so I do, too.",""
"55049764-5-4884","If I ever get out of here, I will come after you!",""
"55049764-5-4889","Now that I have the key to operate the Dwemer memory device, we should locate the lore vault. If I remember correctly, the vault is hidden among the snowy chambers of the ruins. Let's go!",""
"55049764-5-4893","I should have been nicer to Kalogar. Told him his cooking wasn't too terrible.",""
"55049764-5-4894","There's one Keeper left, and I worry for her. Imiril guards the area closest to Rilis' prison. The two have a … strained rapport.nnOf all of us, the High Kinlord would bear the fiercest grudge against Imiril. The sooner you find her, the better.",""
"55049764-5-4895","Blood for the Pact!",""
"55049764-5-4898","Leave this place while you still can. We have nothing more to discuss. nnThe only reason you still live is because I gave you my word. Now go.",""
"55049764-5-4904","Hunting Mer like animals? What a grisly story you tell … but not many will believe it.",""
"55049764-5-4907","Still so much to do. So much death. Yes.",""
"55049764-5-4913","Have you dealt with the Steel Shrikes before? They're a nasty bunch of Redguards from Covenant lands. All about war, conquest and glory, and the rest of that rubbish.nnA complete nuisance on a good day, but today's looking worse and worse.",""
"55049764-5-4914","I suppose the Shrikes thought it funny to truss up a master of escape. Seems I'll have to practice with the rope a bit more.nnWe can't just let them get away with this. Luckily for everyone, I have a plan!",""
"55049764-5-4915","Lead the way. We'll be right behind you.",""
"55049764-5-4916","My axe! It feels good to have it back. It's part of me. Losing it was like losing an arm.",""
"55049764-5-4919","Hello, friend. I understand you continue to assist the Ebonheart Pact.",""
"55049764-5-4920","Well? Don't just stand there staring at me. I'm very busy and I don't have time to play seven questions.",""
"55049764-5-4921","With luck, we'll soon get reinforcements from Velyn Harbor.nnOnce Cirnean gets out, she'll want some entertainment. And by that, I mean she'll zap some Sea Vipers with lightning.",""
"55049764-5-4924","The magic of the Dreamstride weakens. You have one more chance to convince King Jorunn to wake up.nnFail and all three of you—you, the Dreamwalker, and King Jorunn—will be lost.",""
"55049764-5-4926","We've got their book and that blasted stone. We need to get under cover if you're going to do anything with them.",""
"55049764-5-4927","We need to take the book and the stone somewhere safe so you can examine them.",""
"55049764-5-4931","I'm so worried. So worried about everyone. And everything.",""
"55049764-5-4936","Yes. What do you want?",""
"55049764-5-4946","I'll stay here for a little while to fully recover my magicka. Thanks to you, I can shield us from enemies until then.",""
"55049764-5-4950","You dare address me? Insolent dog!nnThose who call themselves ""stormwardens"" are hardly fit for the title. They can barely control the storms, much less dispatch intruders from our sacred grounds!",""
"55049764-5-4951","We'd let the mammoths just sleep the effects off, but it might be dangerous for us to round them back up later. They're very docile in their pen. Honest.",""
"55049764-5-4955","The might of the Five Hundred is behind you, comrade.",""
"55049764-5-4956","Hakra and Valdur fighting at our side is a great honor. nnWhen we stop Thallik Wormfather, though, you will be remembered as the hero.",""
"55049764-5-4964","You've got the shards? Excellent! Keep them with you. They'll prove key to our victory, I'm certain.nnNow you need to defeat the guardian. Its power prevents me from any access to Silvenar. Do that, and I will contact you as I did in Jathsogur.",""
"55049764-5-4976","Is it safe? Did you find my husband?",""
"55049764-5-4992","If you seek an audience, I must apologize.nnThe King is busy and I don't know when he'll be avaliable again.",""
"55049764-5-4995","You fought well and made us proud. Goodbye, friend.",""
"55049764-5-5001","Our ways are not your ways, outsider. Don't meddle in things you don't understand.",""
"55049764-5-5009","So. Aera was behind much of this, wasn't she? I don't pretend to know her reasons. All I want to know is whether you've dealt with her or not.",""
"55049764-5-5010","I'll never win any popularity contests with this group, but you should know that I'm grateful to you. You rescued me from the Castle of the Worm at great personal risk. I won't forget that.",""
"55049764-5-5020","I figured you'd be up here. Another contract completed by, well, you again. I wonder if the Tong is testing me or something.nnStill, a success is a success, right? I hope I didn't scare the ambassadors too badly.",""
"55049764-5-5027","You have been dismissed.",""
"55049764-5-5028","You have a sly look about you, stranger. I'm watching you.",""
"55049764-5-5029","Have you spoken with the thane's advisor, Borodin?",""
"55049764-5-5032","You're a scout, yeah? Sent by Gjakil? Quick, you've got to get word back ….",""
"55049764-5-5033","What luck. You denied me my vengeance in <<1>>. Had my beloved Silvenar still lived, he would have approved of your mercy.nnIt's your wisdom I need now. Tell me, would you aid my cause?",""
"55049764-5-5034","Sorry, need to focus. Imiril's going to be fine, but she'll need a healthy dose of restoration magic to get back on her feet.nnIf you must speak, speak with Cirion.",""
"55049764-5-5036","Taking coin from Turil. To steal from me? The Three take you!",""
"55049764-5-5037","This town is filled with criminals and cultists. Why did I think you'd be different? The silks I peddle would have been wasted on these barbarians.",""
"55049764-5-5044","That was her, Sage Tirora. nnI suppose I'll see her again, on the other side of the bridge.",""
"55049764-5-5046","Let's get out before any more spriggans are hurt.",""
"55049764-5-5049","Good to see you again, comrade. You recall our encounter with Doshia, yes? When we found her strange journal?",""
"55049764-5-5051","How goes the adventure? Cozy among the cobwebs and blankets of dust?",""
"55049764-5-5052","This one greets your return, comrade.",""
"55049764-5-5053","Good to see you again, comrade. Stendarr had a hand in your return to us, I think.",""
"55049764-5-5060","My friend, I'm glad to see you again. We could have used you here.",""
"55049764-5-5062","The Worm Cult must not succeed.",""
"55049764-5-5063","So much remains to be done before <<1>> is safe.",""
"55049764-5-5064","Passion mustn't compete with duty.",""
"55049764-5-5070","Please, stop! I can't take this much longer.",""
"55049764-5-5080","Engling is right, we'll make sure songs are sung of your bravery here. I just hope this little event has taught these cubs a lesson about ancient lore. Some of those books bite back. Hah!",""
"55049764-5-5087","<<1>> seems like an interesting case. Was her amulet truly a gift from the Three? Or perhaps it was Sheogorath's idea of a cruel joke. nnEither way, it seems you now carry a gift from her to the Prince of Madness.",""
"55049764-5-5091","They're plotting. I can hear them. Drawing their plans against me. But I'm smarter, oh yes. I'm the clever one.nnWhat? What do you want? Who are you?",""
"55049764-5-5096","He's called a gathering of the Council of Province Generals at Fort Amol. You should find him at the Hall there.",""
"55049764-5-5108","Speak to <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>. Choose one to fight by your side.",""
"55049764-5-5110","That must've hurt! Honestly, I didn't expect a barrier across the entrance.nnThe Cult must have set this up as a last line of defense in case they were attacked.",""
"55049764-5-5111","You'll find the Mistress of Incunabula in the snows of my homeland, at the Guildhall in Windhelm. Good luck, Adept.",""
"55049764-5-5116","How goes your tale, scribe of the spinners?",""
"55049764-5-5127","The captain sent myself and Sergeant Linaarie here to the marketplace to collect supplies for the rest of the troops. When the enemy struck, we were cut off.nnWe need to arm and rally the civilians before our enemies swarm over Market Bridge.",""
"55049764-5-5128","To the lighthouse! Finish off the Ra Gada captain! We'll take care of things out here.",""
"55049764-5-5129","Don't delay!",""
"55049764-5-5135","The mercenaries wish to fight. Their blades must not be used against my people. So, we'll give them a new opponent.nnThey'll soon realize their courier's late. We must quickly return him to their ranks.",""
"55049764-5-5136","The lieutenant. Dead. I can't believe it!nnWhat are we going to do? Does the sergeant have any ideas?",""
"55049764-5-5140","Get in there! We need to know what the Reach are up to. Be careful though. Don't want to have to explain to Jorunn why you're dead.",""
"55049764-5-5145","Jorunn's Stand is east of here. It's a fort in the Icewind Peaks, and getting there is a bit of a journey.nnWhen you arrive, look for my quarters in a cave within the Fighters Guild area.",""
"55049764-5-5147","I will seek out these monks once I make sure everything here is all right.nnI will see you soon.d",""
"55049764-5-5163","By the light of Auri-El, you've returned.",""
"55049764-5-5165","<<1>> writes as fast as possible, but still these spinners come up with more to say! After uncountable generations, they still change the story.nnDo you know the story of the Silvenar and the Green Lady? Or I should say, one of the stories?",""
"55049764-5-5172","Luck. Pure luck. Happens once in a while. Don't let it go to your head.",""
"55049764-5-5175","You found the fire salts? Good job. Now find <<1>>'s kindlepitch and you'll be ready. Talk to him if you want to know more.",""
"55049764-5-5183","Please look for Lucius. Coldcorn Ruin would be the best place to start.",""
"55049764-5-5184","These ceremonies are important to my people, which makes them important to me. I guess.",""
"55049764-5-5185","Fair day. How goes the translations?nnWait. You're not one of Telenger's students.",""
"55049764-5-5189","I felt the cursed drawn back to these ruins. Just as I felt your touch release them back to Aetherius.",""
"55049764-5-5200","Something's happened. The spirits appear to be growing docile again.",""
"55049764-5-5205","Others doubted you, but I knew you could do it!",""
"55049764-5-5213","Without your help, we would never have killed <<1>>.nnUnfortunately, I've received word from the Smokefrost Peaks that forces me to ask more of you.",""
"55049764-5-5219","Now, to more pressing matters. Teldur has betrayed us!",""
"55049764-5-5221","All this standing around is driving me mad. I don't mean to question the king's orders, but I'm ready to strike back against these damn cultists.nnWell, if you're as anxious as I am to see us take back Honrich Tower, I could use your help.",""
"55049764-5-5224","A marvel such as I've never seen. If only there was a way to communicate with the beasts themselves!nnHm. I do hope their appearance won't attract attention.",""
"55049764-5-5233","What kind of an idiot carries a note around implicating himself? This kind, I assume.",""
"55049764-5-5234","You're not with the Houndsmen, are you? Are you one of Silvenar's loyalists? Please, I need help!",""
"55049764-5-5236","I'll meet you back at the camp. Go ahead and fight the Houndsmen! That'll distract them so I can escape!",""
"55049764-5-5237","Get over here! Before the Houndsmen sniff you out!",""
"55049764-5-5238","Stop! Get back! I tell you, I have friends, friends in high places!",""
"55049764-5-5243","Once the Queen has fulfilled her sacred duties I'll get her to safety in Firsthold. The sooner that happens, the better.",""
"55049764-5-5256","Now to ascend to the summit of <<1>> and defeat <<2>>!",""
"55049764-5-5257","Now on to the summit to kill <<1>>!",""
"55049764-5-5264","Each entertainer has a specialty, of sorts, that likely matches the tastes of the mercenaries. You'll just have to figure it out, I suppose.",""
"55049764-5-5265","We would never have made it this far without you. Now we must get to the summit and face <<1>>.",""
"55049764-5-5268","Eight watch over you. You'll find Urcelmo at the Mages Guild. Just follow the path behind me up and around. You'll find him no problem.",""
"55049764-5-5269","Hold there. Firsthold is under siege. We'll need you to head back to the main road.",""
"55049764-5-5270","I take it you spoke with Sinien? With the wards down, we can move on the castle. That's the key to retaking the city.",""
"55049764-5-5271","Just remember, it will take a moment or two for the ritual to do its work. I'd clear out the Daedra first. Assuming you don't want to be eaten.nnOh, and say hello to Razzie for me!",""
"55049764-5-5278","Stars guide you. Beware the spirits here. The dead do not rest as quietly as they should.",""
"55049764-5-5282","Make way for the champion, eh?",""
"55049764-5-5283","Nicely done, champion.",""
"55049764-5-5288","Is it done? Have the guards taken him away? I didn't hear any commotion.",""
"55049764-5-5292","I guess you've been of use. Good work helping them with that goo.",""
"55049764-5-5293","Amuur and I will be making the rounds soon enough. Check in on the people you spoke with.nnEverything's going to be all right. You'll see.",""
"55049764-5-5298","Last one! What's the answer?",""
"55049764-5-5305","Estre is vulnerable. But Tamriel is still open to the Deadlands. This must not be.nnWe must close her gates. End the threat of the Daedra.",""
"55049764-5-5309","Are you going to help me or not?",""
"55049764-5-5323","There you are! I was worried they might've caught you and thrown you back, but you seem to be made of sterner stuff.nnSo far, anyway. You ready for what lies beyond?",""
"55049764-5-5324","Please. Think before you make your decision.",""
"55049764-5-5344","Please. Just hurry. I can't stand the thought of those bastards dragging Nelulin around in that pit.",""
"55049764-5-5347","Very entertaining.",""
"55049764-5-5348","You sing like a dying goat. Nice work.",""
"55049764-5-5352","Move along now. Hendil and Amuur are the only ones allowed inside.",""
"55049764-5-5366","Good … good luck in here.",""
"55049764-5-5387","I'd swear we just left the battlefield at Boulderfall, eh? Blood and the Pact wait for no-one.",""
"55049764-5-5401","Thanks for the help, friend. At the least, those bastards won't be around much longer. And I get to keep all my treasures!nn<<1>> will get us to Anvil. She's a resourceful lass.",""
"55049764-5-5403","We'll get <<1>> to Anvil safely, don't worry.",""
"55049764-5-5406","Find anything?",""
"55049764-5-5416","No telling what would have happened in the Ragged Hills if you hadn't shown up.",""
"55049764-5-5422","At last! Someone with the power to aid my efforts.nnI am Farandare, and I've spent my lifetime trying to rescue the city of Falinesti. With your help, I may be able to do it.",""
"55049764-5-5423","Well, what are you waiting for?",""
"55049764-5-5429","I'm busy here. Away with you.",""
"55049764-5-5438","The Prophet!nnHe's a prisoner here, too. It was very dangerous for him to speak to you, even for a moment. He must think you can help me.",""
"55049764-5-5439","Hail, my new friend! The touch of the divine inspired me, told me you'd succeeded in your task. Is it true?",""
"55049764-5-5444","Tread carefully. Remember, we need him alive.",""
"55049764-5-5447","So many good people lost these last few years. Don't let her death be meaningless.",""
"55049764-5-5448","Good luck in there.",""
"55049764-5-5454","Let us finish the task at hand. We can chat afterward.",""
"55049764-5-5464","What do you want? Wait, nevermind. I don't want to know. I'm not taking on any fares today.",""
"55049764-5-5466","Do I know you? You look familiar. Could just be the spiced wine talking.",""
"55049764-5-5473","You need to leave this place, stranger. It will soon be crawling with Daedric shadows.nnWe've been in conflict with the Spider Cult for days, and it appears they have won.",""
"55049764-5-5475","Did you find <<1>>?",""
"55049764-5-5477","Found me all by yourself did you? Well, let's get started, and I hope you're better than the others Ankur has sent to me.",""
"55049764-5-5481","<There's a small pouch in the hollow tree>",""
"55049764-5-5491","Today could have been worse. I could be dead.",""
"55049764-5-5502","Oh, I'm so little and helpless. I don't know what I'll do without someone brave and strong to save me.",""
"55049764-5-5506","Well, I'm glad you made it. I was about to give up on you. Are you ready for your next job?",""
"55049764-5-5509","Nice work. Ankur's recruits usually don't work out, but you just might.",""
"55049764-5-5519","You look like a capable sort. You haven't been eaten by draugr, at any rate.",""
"55049764-5-5537","Thank you for finding me. They were going to kill me too.",""
"55049764-5-5538","My daughter is found! And my no-good son as well, from what I hear.",""
"55049764-5-5539","You're back! You made it. Thank the Eight.",""
"55049764-5-5540","I hope the notes are still there!",""

"55049764-5-5568","I never thought I'd see my wife again!",""
"55049764-5-5575","Good luck. When you're done, meet me on the ship.",""

"55049764-5-5734","Ah, sweet freedom! Just as I expected.nnI wasn't expecting the cat and his friends, though. That's a bit of a surprise. Your doing, I take it? Well, pray tell, what shall we do now?",""
"55049764-5-5735","You know, you might just have to kill the Observer to end this game. I doubt you can do it, though, but I suppose you have to try.nnSorry. I have to tell it like it is. False hope can be so disheartening.",""
"55049764-5-5736","I really am sorry about your friends. Better them than me, I always say.nnNow, where are we going next, if I may inquire?",""
"55049764-5-5741","The outsider returns. And was your Trial of Spirit successful?",""
"55049764-5-5749","You again. Why are you still sober? What kind of a milk-drinker are you? Grab a mead and join the celebration.",""
"55049764-5-5752","Don't worry. A Proctor remembers those who were useful.",""
"55049764-5-5772","Horrible things … they've never done this before.nnI'm ruined. I should just let myself be eaten.",""
"55049764-5-5775","Thank you for dealing with the wamasu. Let's hope <<1>>  fixes the amulet before anyone else gets hurt.",""
"55049764-5-5776","Oh, hello there. Didn't see you approach.nnAre you looking for work? If so, I seem to need a new assistant for my research.",""
"55049764-5-5786","Some of <<1>>'s guard arrived to defend the fisher-folk and refugees. I thought to sneak along the beaches, see what I could learn. Then I saw you.nnSo, what should we do?",""
"55049764-5-5787","As always, Margot's totally blowing this out of proportion. Lucas is probably fine.",""
"55049764-5-5790","Please, this won't take long.",""
"55049764-5-5791","Ha! I just spoke a prayer to the Khenarthi for aid, and look who blows through the door!nnIt's always good to see you, even in a city riddled with pirates. But I must ask, why are here?",""
"55049764-5-5792","Leave me alone. I have nothing more to say to you.",""
"55049764-5-5793","<<1>> and I have a long journey ahead of us. In time, I hope she'll warm to me. I'm not a bad person. nnIn the meantime, I'll have to keep a better eye on her.",""
"55049764-5-5794","We must find my captains. They will be able to cover us while we retrieve the Amulet.",""
"55049764-5-5795","<<1>> was a hard-skulled fool, but convincing him to back down? Such wisdom … we could all learn from your example.nnOur fires are yours to tend, whether forge or hearth. You are always welcome in <<2>>.",""
"55049764-5-5796","Don't forget to touch one of the wisps. That's what activates the properties of the bark.nnGood luck. And I hope you find your friend before my clan kills him.",""
"55049764-5-5797","I'll look for you in the Hollow City. Who knows? Maybe we'll end up fighting side-by-side one day.",""
"55049764-5-5800","We run a delicate operation, and losing our workers to the marsh would have put our plans in jeopardy. Stranglers are harder to bribe than pirates, yes?nnBut if you're sticking around <<1>>, perhaps we could speak of  opportunity for coin.",""
"55049764-5-5807","Hail, tester!  If you're seeing this, you can check off the ""interact with a friendly"" test case.",""
"55049764-5-5808","Hello again, outlander. Your words remain with me. I find the challenge of building my own realm invigorating.",""
"55049764-5-5817","Ah, good! Everyone back in one place. I was beginning to worry!",""
"55049764-5-5821","Hey there, friend. You looking to run a frog?",""
"55049764-5-5832","Hail, tester!  If you're seeing this, you can check off the ""interact with a friendly"" test case.",""
"55049764-5-5835","Tin's a fussy metal to work. You want to chat, find <<1>> at the front gate.",""
"55049764-5-5836","<<1>> has enough excuse to flay my hide. I don't want to give her another.nnShe's looking this way. Leave me be.",""
"55049764-5-5845","<<1>> went to search for you in one of the collapsed passageways. You should try to find her.",""
"55049764-5-5846","I think this could be it!",""
"55049764-5-5849","Does the Pact-soldier need help to squash <<1>> flat? <<2>> helps! nnSwamp-lizards should be fought in battle, not destroyed in eggs. <<2>> enlisted to stop the Dominion's enemies, and Brute-vitar is bigger enemy than Pact or Covenant.",""
"55049764-5-5851","Don't delay too long. The Imperials usually kill prisoners.",""
"55049764-5-5856","Be seeing you.",""
"55049764-5-5859","You simply must come to the estate and perform like that for our guests. nnI know they'll relish it.",""
"55049764-5-5860","We watch. We wait. We pray these Orcs will go away.nnDon't tell Mistress <<1>>, but I can't help but think we are wasting our time.",""
"55049764-5-5863","You … you must be the one who was causing so much noise in the Black Forge.",""
"55049764-5-5885","Go on ahead. We're going to see if we can muscle through this door here while you search for an easier way to get it open.nnMy notes say that you'll find a mechanism in the Guardian's Helm that will help.",""
"55049764-5-5890","There is always more to learn where Dwemer are involved. Let us be off!",""
"55049764-5-5892","<<1>> burns bright. Once you've lit the fires, go after <<2>> while his mutineers focus on the dock.nnAnd don't be afraid to whistle for help. Those cretins stabbed my crew in the back. We're itching to return the favor.",""
"55049764-5-5893","The gods are fickle and not known for their patience. Please deliver those petitions.",""
"55049764-5-5895","Haskill, here again. Sheogorath is such a craven. Sending a toad like that one to do his dirty work.",""
"55049764-5-5897","The play is nearly done. Are you leaving the audience waiting? How avant garde.",""
"55049764-5-5898","Reinforcements at last! How did you do?",""
"55049764-5-5899","What was that? Head's still ringing. I … I think I'm going to lay down.nnOh wait, no … the captain said laying down was bad. I can't lay down. I'll keep counting my fingers until they add up right.",""
"55049764-5-5900","Go on with you, those chickens aren't going to roast themselves. Just remember to point the far end of the wand away from you. He's lost some followers that way.",""
"55049764-5-5903","Byz will not scream for help. Byz promises.",""
"55049764-5-5908","Some time this Era would be convenient.",""
"55049764-5-5911","Ha, good! Good! Don't let anyone tell you these spirit bastards don't know how to fight.",""
"55049764-5-5920","Come, let us find my sister. She gets up to all kinds of trouble if I leave her alone for too long.",""
"55049764-5-5922","Yes? Do you have something for me?",""
"55049764-5-5923","Keep it down!",""
"55049764-5-5943","What are you standing around for? I'm not proud of what we've decided to do, but we might as well get it over with.",""
"55049764-5-5947","Seems I've a lot to thank you for. I didn't expect you to go off and save my sister while I was away.nnGlad you made it here in one piece.",""
"55049764-5-5952","This one cannot take it again. I can't take losing to her again, I just can't.",""
"55049764-5-5953","Hello, hero. Good to see you got out of there in one piece. I understand that Almalexia can be a little rough on her toys.nnWhile you were getting cozy with the goddess, I discovered something interesting.",""
"55049764-5-5957","Accept my gratitude.","Accetta la mia gratitudine."
"55049764-5-5970","Who're you? You're not allowed in the chief's home! Get out!nnOh, I see. Yes, you'd better get out now.",""
"55049764-5-5979","You handle yourself well, champion.",""
"55049764-5-5980","Everyone here looks up to you and me. Can you blame them?",""
"55049764-5-5981","The Pact could use a soldier like you.",""
"55049764-5-5982","At last you wake. I was worried.",""
"55049764-5-5983","Some say I am obsessed with battle. They are wrong, I am obsessed with life. And life is war.",""
"55049764-5-5984","Crafty Lerisa, Jakarn, and Neramo are the ones I'm interested in. Recruiting any one of them would be great. Getting all three would be ideal.",""
"55049764-5-5985","Pains me to admit it, but you can handle yourself in a fight.",""
"55049764-5-5987","I overhead Feluz ask about his lucky pouch. That's where he kept his moon-sugar candy. I'm glad you didn't find it. nnFeluz said he'll never eat another piece, but I don't believe him. I'll be keeping a close eye on this one.",""
"55049764-5-5990","Excellent.  Now you can stand around here wrestling idiots.",""
"55049764-5-5995","I've got such a problem.",""
"55049764-5-5996","I'm not sure you're supposed to be here.",""
"55049764-5-6001","If I found a handsome guy locked in a cell, I'd free him.",""
"55049764-5-6011","Great! <<1>> knows I have my treats. Why were you so obvious when you handed me the pouch?",""
"55049764-5-6012","This is the Blessed Crucible, where the fiercest fighters in Tamriel burn, bite, and slash each other for coin.",""
"55049764-5-6032","You did us a good turn. Rama owes his life to you.",""
"55049764-5-6039","She's dead! I can't believe it!",""
"55049764-5-6041","Seems like my guards let anyone in nowadays.",""
"55049764-5-6042","I hear you got Crafty Lerisa and her crew out of trouble. Good work. I can use someone with her skills.",""
"55049764-5-6051","You have my thanks, stranger! Truly!nnIt's paramount that the Ayleid warlord is not raised. I need you to check his body and—if he has returned—deal with him.",""
"55049764-5-6065","Kalari's a sweet kid. Reads to me sometimes. Hope you can help her out.",""
"55049764-5-6066","Hallowed, Khali is not prepared for what's required here. Choose me to contain the Dark Mane.",""
"55049764-5-6067","Damn it, old man! Apologies. That wasn't meant for you. You'd think that I'd be used to working with him, but ….",""
"55049764-5-6068","Hallowed, Shazah cannot contain this darkness. She does not have the strength. Choose me to take on this burden.",""
"55049764-5-6069","Looks like the plan was a success. Despite the collateral damage. Such is life, soldier.",""
"55049764-5-6070","Destroy the siege weapons, tents, and cargo first. Then go after the Colovian command. nnWe have a score to settle with these guys. We're going to take it personally.",""
"55049764-5-6071","Done already?",""
"55049764-5-6072","Watch what you track in here. This is Captain Kaleen's cabin!",""
"55049764-5-6094","You are very brave. May the Moons brightly shine down on your soul, as your soul shines out … in the night.",""
"55049764-5-6099","You will speak with the Clanmother, yes? Shuzura will want to know all that you have done.",""
"55049764-5-6101","Welcome to the <<1>>! As you can see, the party is just warming up!",""
"55049764-5-6110","Bright moons guide your path. While you're in the field, keep your eyes out for a Khajiiti agent named Razum-dar. He's operating in the area as well.",""
"55049764-5-6111","I hope you recover our seeds before the Goblins eat them. Goblins aren't very bright.",""
"55049764-5-6112","Ahh, excellent. Andewen has finally sent me a stalwart assistant. We can set to work right away.",""
"55049764-5-6117","Bright moons, traveler. Welcome to our little town of S'ren-ja. nnTazia does not suppose you'd like to help her fix the bridge?",""
"55049764-5-6123","You help Kalari now, yes? Tazia tells this one you are brave, to face the spirits.",""
"55049764-5-6124","Raz feels he should say it has been nice to meet you. Do not worry, new friend. Just because you have killed him the first time you met him? This one will not hold it against you.",""
"55049764-5-6126","This one has found it is best not to keep Shuzura waiting.nnHe is just saying.",""
"55049764-5-6130","<<1>>'s not looking good. I need to get him out of here.nnDon't think either of us would've made it if you hadn't come along. I don't say this very often … thank you.",""
"55049764-5-6150","These cultists weren't much trouble. There was a portal open when we got here, but it closed when we attacked. Azlakha would know more.",""
"55049764-5-6155","Good thing you sailed in with Captain Kaleen. Outsiders aren't welcome on Betnikh, especially not now.",""
"55049764-5-6183","We need all the help we can get. nnI'd start with those enforcers. Someone has to stop them from harassing the townsfolk.",""
"55049764-5-6191","Hurry! Destroy the conduit.",""
"55049764-5-6197","Welcome to the Harborage, Vestige. This is as comfortable a home as an old dried-up husk like myself could hope for.",""
"55049764-5-6198","You … you are the Hallowed! You have come in our hour of need! Please, Moon Hallowed. We've been driven from the temple, and the Claw is in terrible danger!",""
"55049764-5-6207","Goblins. Don't you just hate them? I sure do. We work and they steal. There seem to be more of them every year too. When you get the chance, cut one in half for me.",""
"55049764-5-6208","The Daggers will find another way to get our start. Breaking the law for some pompous noble isn't how we'll get our reputation.nnJust keep Diel busy and I'll handle the rest.",""
"55049764-5-6218","As ugly as things may be out here, I heard a rumor that our real worries are inside the city. Someone said they're holding the Staff of Magnus in there.nnIf that thing fell into the wrong hands … well, I've heard it could destroy the Dominion.",""
"55049764-5-6220","Once the skulls are placed, I can speak with them to find out what they know.",""
"55049764-5-6233","I know Talmo wants his banner back, but I have a proposal for you.",""
"55049764-5-6235","Go! Travel to Moonmont, the ancient temple. You will learn what must come next, yes? Yes.",""
"55049764-5-6236","I can't thank you enough for helping me win my bet. I'd buy you a drink, but I need all my coin for …. cooking supplies. Yes, that's it, cooking supplies.",""
"55049764-5-6240","If anything has happened to At'avar ….",""
"55049764-5-6243","Thank you for exposing the cook's perfitudity! I'll make certain everyone knows she lets her intoxification rule her judgmentalism!",""
"55049764-5-6252","It was quite a thrill sneaking into Mannimarco's castle, embedded in the skin of Oblivion, crawling with the walking dead and soul-eating Daedric horrors.nnLet's never do that again, yeah?",""
"55049764-5-6254","You're very lucky. <<1>> risked her life by dragging you out of that poison gas. nnMost Imperials aren't so partial to members of the Pact, but she's naive.",""
"55049764-5-6261","Marius has grown very impatient. I'm almost certain he'll use the poison for personal gain. It can't fall into his hands.",""
"55049764-5-6269","Please find whoever you can and give them those potions. nnPeople won't last long out there. They need to be here, where it's safe.",""
"55049764-5-6276","I joined the Knights of the Flame to defend Alcaire, not for all this… politics.nnI don't even want to talk about it. You should speak with Sir Edmund before you go into the keep though.",""
"55049764-5-6285","Jone and Jode smile down upon us. Are you ready to enter the reliquary, the inner sanctum of Do'Krin?",""
"55049764-5-6286","Bright Moons above! The Hallowed! Please, if you have a moment. Would you help poor Felari?",""
"55049764-5-6288","I told you I never wanted to see your face again!",""
"55049764-5-6292","To have seen such things. The Path is truly a hard road to walk, Hallowed.",""
"55049764-5-6301","Clear the city, end the Daedric threat, and we can meet at the temple. We can usher in a new era of unity for this Aldmeri Dominion.",""
"55049764-5-6317","Very impressive, Hallowed. Very impressive indeed.",""
"55049764-5-6318","Your scent is one of victory. The city has been cleansed by your hand. You must bring the same closure to the Khajiiti people.",""
"55049764-5-6319","You have saved a precious jewel from devastation. My people thank you.",""
"55049764-5-6328","Walk carefully, you tread on sacred ground.",""
"55049764-5-6332","Hermaeus-Mora sees and knows.",""
"55049764-5-6335","Raz heard sounds of fighting. Did you catch up with Asteril? Were you able to question her about Pelidil?",""
"55049764-5-6337","Even if Asteril's fled the city, you might be able to find some clues about Pelidil's plans in her quarters. nnLet's hope you find something, because otherwise we don't have much to go on.",""
"55049764-5-6339","I could hear the fire salts exploding from here. Good work. My agents will make quick work of the Dominion's forces.nnNow, to end this. Do you still have the Relleis Lor keystone?",""
"55049764-5-6340","We're not overly fond of rules here in Bramblebreach, but I have to admit that it peeves me to no end when people come into my chambers and just loiter about.nnRun along now. I'm sure you have better things to do than sit around with me.",""
"55049764-5-6362","Keep staring, outlander, and I'll repay the sacking of Orsinium twice over. A few scratches don't bother me.",""
"55049764-5-6364","Welcome aboard! Let's get you disguised, and then it's onward to fortune and glory! And a bit of thievery.",""
"55049764-5-6372","Stay alert. I don't want to end up on that slab again.",""
"55049764-5-6378","You … I know you from Alcaire. You roughed up so many of my Bravos. Tamriel is a small place after all. I just returned from Alcaire myself. Back in my chair, drinking my wine with my wife ….nnWait. Please tell me you're not here to disturb me?",""
"55049764-5-6382","I can't stand the thought of that cultist directing Bruma's destruction from my old home. Kill him!",""
"55049764-5-6395","What's going on? Shadowscales, here? No—they can't be!",""
"55049764-5-6397","Tharn and the Dark Mane dare to tread on temple ground! Blasphemies against the Two Moons Dance. And corruption crawls the walls in Moonmont's inner chamber.",""
"55049764-5-6408","Welcome to my Court, outsider. Since you entered my domain, I have watched your actions with a keen interest. You have been generous with my people and more patient than I expected. nnBut I still cannot gather one thing—why have you come?",""
"55049764-5-6409","I'm so glad to be out of there. I never thought I'd see the sun again!",""
"55049764-5-6410","Show some respect. You don't want to make the boss angry, trust me.",""
"55049764-5-6415","Please! You must stop, listen to me. You have come to <<1>> for the games, yes? The gambling? My <<2>> is missing. I fear the worst and I don't know what to do.",""
"55049764-5-6421","Well … that one ran off even sooner than I expected. Come back some other time though.nnI'll figure out how to keep then under control. I know I will!",""
"55049764-5-6422","Speak to General Malgoth. I'll be right here.",""
"55049764-5-6424","Your lizard is the winner! You are an excellent judge of reptiles.",""
"55049764-5-6429","It is good to be back in this ancient city. I need to assess our strengths and weaknesses, determine how best to make our assault against Molag Bal.nnIf we strike before we build up a sufficient force, however, I fear we shall lose this war.",""
"55049764-5-6436","I recommend heading west first to find the Ayleid King, but the choice is yours.nnIf you wish to free King Dynar, you must recover the Lights of Meridia. The lights have the power to unlock his prison of darkness.",""
"55049764-5-6437","A noble effort, but this one thinks you could use a bit more practice.",""
"55049764-5-6440","I can't say I'm looking forward to seeing Tharn again.",""
"55049764-5-6441","I don't know about trusting a Daedra, but if he's going to get us inside, I say take advantage of it and kill him if he blinks at you funny.",""
"55049764-5-6442","You keep up nicely! I can't abide dawdlers.",""
"55049764-5-6444","The Elder Scroll of Ghartok has been captured by Dominion forces. A great victory!",""
"55049764-5-6447","I still don't trust the Dremora, but killing Ifriz would certainly make me feel better. Anything that shuts him up would be a welcome reprieve.",""
"55049764-5-6448","This one will behave. You have nothing to fear from Ezreba.",""
"55049764-5-6456","Now you must decide the outcome of Haj Uxith's long debate. Will the Hist tree live or die? The choice is yours to make, outsider.",""
"55049764-5-6457","You need to get back to it and help Captain Eilram. Go on.",""
"55049764-5-6458","You know how to choose a troll! Khaba congratulates you on your winnings.",""
"55049764-5-6478","Minwe was my friend and chief competitor when I started my gang. She was mean then and being dead has only made her meaner.",""
"55049764-5-6482","There is still the matter of Ezreba to consider. She betrayed the people of this village. And she's been a good friend for years. I honestly don't know what to do.",""
"55049764-5-6483","Can make it to safety. Don't wait for me.",""
"55049764-5-6485","The Sea Vipers must have dragged survivors out of the wreckage … but how many?",""
"55049764-5-6486","I can make my own way inland, gods willing.",""
"55049764-5-6487","Not quite ready to push my luck again. One brush with death is enough for the day. I'll move on shortly.",""
"55049764-5-6506","Deal with that bear as soon as you can. One fewer hungry mouth around here would be a good thing.",""
"55049764-5-6509","Nothing you say will convince me. I'm sealing myself in that tomb.",""
"55049764-5-6510","We should hurry. <<1>> won't be trapped for long.",""
"55049764-5-6514","<<1>> has time for you. I don't.",""
"55049764-5-6515","Here is the potion. I hope Zur didn't cut any corners. But knowing him, it probably tastes terrible.",""
"55049764-5-6543","Apologies, I can't be bothered right now.",""
"55049764-5-6586","The Green keep you! If you hadn't come along I don't know … I could have ….",""
"55049764-5-6590","Keep your wits about you in the embassy. The Maormer security is rather lax, but if they suspect your goal, they will not hesitate to run you through.",""
"55049764-5-6591","They hide our eggs in their filthy camps. You must enter their homes to rescue our children. But be very careful. Such an intrusion will result in great pain and death if they catch you.",""
"55049764-5-6593","The Collies are on the run, and Kazirra's thrilled. By the Green I wish we could stop for a brew. But no such luck. You have more work to do.",""
"55049764-5-6594","You're amazing. We could not have done this without you. Thank you, from the depths of my heart.",""
"55049764-5-6596","This diplomatic mission is a farce. The Dominion should've taken <<1>> by force, and sorted the rest out later.",""
"55049764-5-6597","Due to your efforts, the Prowler is free to sail once the tide comes in. Those marines did their part as well.nnI have no reinforcements, but I offer something better. I know who's killing the Dominion soldiers. And I know how to stop it.",""
"55049764-5-6599","We've taken <<1>> into custody, thanks to your quick action. No treaty will keep him from proper justice.",""
"55049764-5-6601","The only person seeking a compromise was <<c:1>>, and now he falls?nnThis is clearly the same Altmer treachery my people once suffered. Mark my words, the only ""Dominion"" is that of the High Elves!",""
"55049764-5-6602","The killer will share the pain my beloved's death has wrought. Hand down the throat, a kiss for my wrist; hand on the lungs, a kiss for my arms. Grasp, tear, yank … and one last kiss for the killer's own heart.nnNow. What have you found?",""
"55049764-5-6607","I'm sorry. My division isn't holding any fights at the moment. Come back soon.",""
"55049764-5-6609","Come back later. This division isn't competing at the moment.",""
"55049764-5-6610","There's a slight delay in my division's fights right now. Come back soon and we'll be ready for you.",""
"55049764-5-6614","Astonishing. The winner of all three divisions! You've done it! Now you must face Ishalga in the main arena to become Grand Champion!",""
"55049764-5-6615","Our clan's been through too much tragedy already. We lost our home, and now our Treethane. Damn it. We're trying to start a new life here. We can't let these Hollow stand in the way of that!",""
"55049764-5-6618","Please, you must restore my energy. Try to convince the slaves to return the energy willingly.nnBut if that doesn't work, you must use the Taskmaster's device to destroy the slaves and release my stamina.",""
"55049764-5-6622","<<1>> must be found. He's all <<2>> has left.",""
"55049764-5-6629","Welcome back. You were gone for longer than I expected.nnI trust you walked in the steps of Prince Sameer of Yath and experienced the events that led to his exile?",""
"55049764-5-6635","We need to find a portal stone to reach my clan's council of elders. There's one near the camp where we found the dead soldier. Let's get out of here and see if my clan will talk to you now.",""
"55049764-5-6636","Hmm. Mother looks upset. You will talk to her, yes?nnI did what was necessary. She must believe that.",""
"55049764-5-6640","I don't care how docile these Kwama normally are. I'll never look at them the same way again.nnHorrid beasts. I would be a hundred leagues from here if there weren't a Dwemer ruin to investigate.",""
"55049764-5-6660","Are you ready to go? I want to see how much the Mages will pay me to survey these ruins.",""
"55049764-5-6661","Thanks to you, we were able to perform the task we were sent here to do. We've opened stable portals to Nirn. Now we can get supplies and more forces into the Hollow City.nnI'd probably still be out there skulking about in scamp-form if not for you.",""
"55049764-5-6663","Unless you're in serious pain, I can't help you right now. I have too many patients to attend.",""
"55049764-5-6667","Well? What did you find?",""
"55049764-5-6674","We share a common problem, little mortal. It only makes sense that we work together to solve it.",""
"55049764-5-6675","Please, you must bring the forbidden tomes to the shrine before they can be destroyed. No one else should suffer.",""
"55049764-5-6686","Don't believe the spirit's lies.",""
"55049764-5-6689","You're truly one of the walkers. We would do well to learn from your efforts.",""
"55049764-5-6697","I swear, Xarxes himself has it in for me, or this is his idea of a joke. nnI've been complaining about how serving in the guard is a waste of my abilities, and now we're in a crisis that demands my skills, and I'm woefully out of my depth!",""
"55049764-5-6701","Tarrami can't thank you enough for getting us out of that predicament. We owe you one!",""
"55049764-5-6705","Kargand is here! It is beyond this Khajiit's power to help you defeat the Daedra in this realm, but please—free my brother from his torment.",""
"55049764-5-6706","What's the matter? Never seen a Daedra before? I'm just … catching my breath.",""
"55049764-5-6729","Sorry. This one does not sign autographs.",""
"55049764-5-6733","My wife Laniriel and I shall meet ye in the village cave of Shrouded Hollow, once the bushes are revived. There is much to be done, if we are to undo the Orcs' defilements.",""
"55049764-5-6734","I won't stand in your way. If you see anything out of place, let me know.",""
"55049764-5-6735","My father … he's gone.",""
"55049764-5-6737","Meet me and my husband Erunor, our Caretaker, at the south village square after restoring the bushes. They're not our only problem.",""
"55049764-5-6747","Sorry, this lodge is off limits.",""
"55049764-5-6753","The crystal … Tashpir hears them inside. Inside his mind! Help!",""
"55049764-5-6756","I've prepared the ritual site, and I'll assist the vampire with her spell. But if she betrays us and our world is destroyed, I'll never speak to you again.",""
"55049764-5-6757","Guide the Lunar Champions well, Moon Hallowed.",""
"55049764-5-6761","The ritual is simple, even for the untrained. As you might have noticed, the Worms aren't exactly scholars.",""
"55049764-5-6766","Go, try the weapons, warrior.",""
"55049764-5-6773","Have you considered my proposal? Will you help me save my children and set them free?",""
"55049764-5-6789","My father … I should have known it would be one of our parents. Just like Mane Zebiden-jo four hundred years ago.",""
"55049764-5-6790","My mother … I can't believe it. Why?",""
"55049764-5-6791","If you reverse the flow of energy, it should free the poor creature trapped in the prism. That should disrupt the Shackle's power!",""
"55049764-5-6794","Talk to Aranias. She needs your support.",""
"55049764-5-6800","If anyone can get to the bottom of this, it's you and Aelif. She's gone outside to get some air. Stendarr guard your steps, my friend.",""
"55049764-5-6806","Our ancestors have left traces of their civilization across Tamriel. If we follow Queen Ayrenn, our empire will one day rival theirs.",""
"55049764-5-6811","So, you did it. I must admit, it's a relief.nnTraditionally you would now be in command of the militia, but is that what you want? If not, who should be?",""
"55049764-5-6821","I've no time for outsiders. I suggest you speak with Carindon, our leader. He's not neck-deep in work.",""
"55049764-5-6822","You look like the adventuring type. Speak with Warlock Carindon, if you'd like to join the expedition.",""
"55049764-5-6831","This area is saturated with magic. I believe we have found the mysterious Selene, however, our way ahead is barred.nnThis journey has been quite the burden.",""
"55049764-5-6832","We've seen you fraternizing with those Crown curs. Be cautious. You may be their next victim.",""
"55049764-5-6833","Crown law officers, ha! Dogs and sons of dogs, all of them.",""
"55049764-5-6834","Welcome, wayfarer. I trust you have not shared your cup with any Forebear scum.",""
"55049764-5-6835","You're doing the Green's work. Thank you. On behalf of the Dominion, and my men. Thank you.",""
"55049764-5-6836","Forebears would bury the wells just to keep us from drinking. In all your travels, you will not find a more treacherous nest of asps.",""
"55049764-5-6843","Lives that have passed from the planes only go on in the memory of the living—and their stories only live so long as there are those who tell them.nnInspect the relics if you wish—each contains a story I can tell.",""
"55049764-5-6847","I will send word to Sentinel. Perhaps my father, or someone else can recall the name of Suturah's daughter.nnLet's hope we can find her soon.",""
"55049764-5-6858","Congratulations, Hallowed. This one is not very spiritual … but even a fool knows we need a shield against the darkness.",""
"55049764-5-6870","Walk in radiance, my valiant friend. I hope that next time I am in battle I find you at my side once again.",""
"55049764-5-6887","Thank you for consecrating my sweet Zariya. nnPerhaps now she and I can be reunited on the Far Shores.",""
"55049764-5-6919","It is good to see you, my friend. Cariel has been updating this one on your work in Arenthia. Very nice. Razum-dar is impressed.",""
"55049764-5-6931","The moons have shown us the future. We have to succeed. We can't let this be the future for our people. For our allies and our friends.",""
"55049764-5-6939","Though I respect my ancestors, I also agree they must be responsible for their actions.",""
"55049764-5-6953","We must work quickly, my friend. Clearly, the blight doesn't affect all Bosmer, but if anyone wanders into this area, I suspect there is a strong chance they will become afflicted.nnY'ffre forbid a scouting party of Vinedusk Rangers comes here.",""
"55049764-5-6954","My friend from the tent! How good to see you. Did you find the ritual components?",""
"55049764-5-6967","I saw the whole thing. You beat Gudarz fair and square. Congratulations. nnAnd thanks.",""
"55049764-5-6968","It's all very frustrating. I'm honestly not sure what can be done at this point.",""
"55049764-5-6969","Things are starting to shape up around here. You had something to do with that, didn't you?",""
"55049764-5-6971","Hmm … it feels like I've been waiting for Pircalmo for some time now. What … what day is it?",""
"55049764-5-6978","Thanks for the help, friend. They stole my clothes, my lady's jewels, and … and my dignity. But at least we can recover Lady Laurent's jewels.nnWill you help me?",""
"55049764-5-6981","I'll lead Stibbons to the exit. Find his lady's jewels and meet us there.",""
"55049764-5-7005","Let the Ayleid King know what an excellent and handsome companion you selected so we can get this mission underway.",""
"55049764-5-7009","Truly the Bright Moons shine down upon you. May your path be lit on the trail ahead.",""
"55049764-5-7015","With the door opened, we can proceed deeper into the Labyrinth.nnGo on! We'll be right behind you.",""
"55049764-5-7027","That's the dowry? That's better than I'd hoped—I mean, expected.",""
"55049764-5-7029","Really, I have no interest in matrimony. Maybe our matchmaker should work on finding a bride for my father instead.",""
"55049764-5-7035","What are you waiting for? Go and collect the dowry for my daughter.nnIf one of my bandits was this slow, I'd string him up.",""
"55049764-5-7039","Damn these gates. Damn the corruption. I should be in there, not Indaenir.nnHe said you'll be able to pass through. Help him. Stop Naemon.",""
"55049764-5-7042","Travel to Stormhaven's eastern reaches and look for the Norvulk Ruins. I will be waiting for you inside.",""
"55049764-5-7043","A moment. This will take all my concentration.",""
"55049764-5-7046","There is one other thing.",""
"55049764-5-7058","You're still breathing. Good! Breathing is good.nn<<1>> is deeper in the sea cave. She's trying to gain control of <<2>>. If she manages this, the Dominion soldiers won't stand a chance.",""
"55049764-5-7066","She is not in her right mind, filled with rage at our treatment. Please, if she comes at you … subdue her, don't kill her.",""
"55049764-5-7068","That harpy out there will give you a lift down to Kozanset. She's the one who carried me to this nest.",""
"55049764-5-7070","Is he the one who wrote all those notes? Thought he'd be uglier.",""
"55049764-5-7071","<<1>> believes his theories are infallible. From my own experience, this isn't the case.nnHe means well, but weigh his advice with care.",""
"55049764-5-7075","I've had enough of this place. Meet me outside!",""
"55049764-5-7108","Only those of Daedric blood may enter the pyramid, little mortal.",""
"55049764-5-7113","Sanguine's breath … I'm ruined. The relics are all gone. The papers are due today! Telenger will never take me on now.",""
"55049764-5-7118","Quite the brawl, eh? If that doesn't strike terror into the heart of the Wormies, I don't know what will!",""
"55049764-5-7119","I couldn't have collected the other village leaders without your help. Thank you.",""
"55049764-5-7122","I can't thank you enough for freeing me.",""
"55049764-5-7123","Do not hesitate to kill him—Erthas will grant you no mercy. That Oblivion Gate must be closed before something worse comes through.nnI was reluctant to ask you for help before, but I'm glad you followed through.",""
"55049764-5-7125","This one is one step closer to returning to the world of the living. Thank you, friend.",""
"55049764-5-7139","Welcome back. What can I get you?",""
"55049764-5-7144","If you're the one Indaenir was referring to, speak with Queen Ayrenn.nnBut no sudden moves.",""
"55049764-5-7145","The queen is frustrated. I am frustrated. To sit idly by while Valenwood is threatened. But anyone who nears Hectahame is corrupted.",""
"55049764-5-7147","Indaenir is dead? He is playing one of his Bosmer tricks. He must be. No … he really is dead.nnDark moons. Curse you Indaenir for being mortal, and curse us for being so slow to arrive after we saw the corruption recede.",""
"55049764-5-7148","Ah, you must be the one Ayrenn is waiting for.",""
"55049764-5-7154","This can't be right. It shouldn't have to end this way.",""
"55049764-5-7156","You look like the one Indaenir described. Speak with Queen Ayrenn.",""
"55049764-5-7158","We need to drive the Daedra out of the other fronts so that Gilraen and the others can have a fighting chance.",""
"55049764-5-7159","There's one more front to deal with.nnYou face the Daedra with an ease I've never encountered! Have you fought them before?",""
"55049764-5-7161","If I never see <<1>> again, it'll be too soon.",""
"55049764-5-7194","The summit's in your hands. It's up to you to determine how we move forward.",""
"55049764-5-7214","Intractable fools. Their pride will see us all dead.",""
"55049764-5-7228","You made interesting decisions. You've shown me much about yourself.",""
"55049764-5-7229","Begone. I no longer take novices on the hunt. I've seen far too many die between the Senche's claws.",""
"55049764-5-7230","I'm not paying them enough to fight Orcs? They are Orcs! They should be used to it! And my betrothed is out there!",""
"55049764-5-7231","Planning to take a stroll in the Orchard? The denizens of that place are quite interesting.nnAnd by interesting, I mean they'll like as not try to tear your face off. We've a lot of that here in Coldharbour, for some reason.",""
"55049764-5-7235","Go, then. I will finish this without you.",""
"55049764-5-7239","Halt! I love saying that. But still, you, ah, probably don't want to go in there. Well, I guess even if you did, you couldn't. There's some sort of ward blocking the way.",""
"55049764-5-7296","Don't return until you've identified the Artisan. No one knows we're working together, and I want to keep it that way.",""
"55049764-5-7305","<<1>> is a master of security. I'm learning so much from him!",""
"55049764-5-7323","Our forces are back in control of the city. If you see any Imperial stragglers skulking about, let me know.",""
"55049764-5-7333","Kala welcomes you to her home. The bright moons watch over you.",""
"55049764-5-7341","I tried, but these thick-skulled bastards will not see reason.",""
"55049764-5-7343","This meeting feels like two wolves and a sheep discussing what to have for dinner. I will not sit back and let them pick at my bones!",""
"55049764-5-7344","With our combined strength we might have a chance, but our distrust runs too deep. I fear we'll never reach an accord.",""
"55049764-5-7369","Hope you don't mind a little song. Helps me stay warm and happy, you know?",""
"55049764-5-7374","Here to bet or another hopeful?nnThis one tires of those who arrive and who do not step inside of the arena. Come to fight, come to win. Come to celebrate with the first person you grab—to feel so alive you cannot breathe.",""
"55049764-5-7407","Hazazi brought me a report on Bramblebreach, including details about this ""Arianas,"" and rumors of the Wilderking. Fascinating legends. nnYou did well there. Bramblebreach scouts will be of great help. No one knows the land better.",""
"55049764-5-7408","Everyone is assembled back in the meeting chamber to hear your findings, advocate.",""
"55049764-5-7411","I think it best if I move on from here soon. I may have been exonerated, but these Elves will never look at me the same. So many of them were so sure of my guilt.",""
"55049764-5-7412","The Green seems satisfied with the judgment, but I still think it was that damnable filthy Khajiit.",""
"55049764-5-7423","They're having an important meeting and asked if I'd give them some privacy. I mean, do you believe it? Where's the trust? Pop on out to the rubbish tip, Cadwell, there's a good lad. Do I mind? Oh, I have no mind. I'm the village bloody idiot!",""
"55049764-5-7430","To have seen such things. The Path is truly a hard road to walk, Hallowed.",""
"55049764-5-7432","Excellent. Well done. A fantastic experiment, if I do say so myself.",""
"55049764-5-7437","No matter what they throw at us, I'll keep our course steady.",""
"55049764-5-7440","Tread lightly now. The timber mammoth is as rare and skittish as they come. I nearly had it, but the damned birds spooked it.",""
"55049764-5-7445","The deepest cuts are from those you trust the most. Spinner Eranas was responsible for our spiritual guidance and he broke our most precious convenant. Hopefully we can learn from this and move on.",""
"55049764-5-7447","The sun bathes us in warmth by day, and the moon in shimmering silver by night. The whole forest rejoices, now that the Pact-breaker, Gathiel, is gone. Thank you, advocate.",""
"55049764-5-7451","Joining Brackenleaf's Briars is nothing to take lightly. Many have died attempting the trials, and there is always the threat of the Outsider.",""
"55049764-5-7452","Well? Are you going to let me do this? He's been a danger to himself, to Wayrest. And he killed my partner.nnYou know he deserves it.",""
"55049764-5-7453","I became Pellingare's guard for the pay. I owe money. A lot.",""
"55049764-5-7454","I truly believed … I truly believed my children would become champions of society; that they could, one day, lead this city into an age of prosperity.nnMy children were good. Once.",""
"55049764-5-7463","It's good to breathe mundane air again, but we have a lot to do to prepare. No time for dallying.",""
"55049764-5-7464","You should get back to Erunor quickly. The Orcs looked restless.",""
"55049764-5-7465","Let good King Dynar know what an excellent choice you made so we can get this caravan on the road.",""
"55049764-5-7467","The house is such a lonely place when my wife isn't here to make it all warm and comfortable.",""
"55049764-5-7468","Speak with Sai Sahan. He wishes to discuss the matters at hand.",""
"55049764-5-7469","Sai Sahan has something to ask you.",""
"55049764-5-7470","The greatest of the Sword-Saints, Divad, tells us that destiny is a chain, forged one link at a time. Our chain is nearly complete. There is but one link remaining.",""
"55049764-5-7471","Give the Redguard your time. He's probably the most sane of these people.",""
"55049764-5-7472","Sameer, my brother! Finally you stir! Did you drink too deeply from the starry well last night? nnThis is unlike you. Quickly, pull yourself together. We can afford no idle time today.",""
"55049764-5-7476","Almalexia smiles upon us, warrior! With her blessings, the Elder Scroll of Altadoon has passed into our hands.",""
"55049764-5-7478","Quickly! To the ancestral crypt!",""
"55049764-5-7488","Welcome to our hall. Are you familiar with the Guild?",""
"55049764-5-7494","Bright Moons go with you. May they light your path, always.",""
"55049764-5-7495","Good to see a competent traveler on the road. The March needs smart people these days.",""
"55049764-5-7503","I do not know how the guards allowed the Elder Scroll of Alma Ruma to be stolen, just that it must be recovered!",""
"55049764-5-7506","<<1>> and <<2>> made it to safety.nnDid you see <<3>> out there? I pray he's still alive.",""
"55049764-5-7508","Sai was right there. We had him! We were so close.",""
"55049764-5-7511","Well, that was unnerving. Can't say that I've ever had to kill a version of myself before. But, I must say, even as an evil doppelganger, I'm a very capable opponent!",""
"55049764-5-7512","The minds of some men can endure hardships far greater than anything the Daedra can concoct. The forces of loyalty, honor, and friendship are powerful indeed!",""
"55049764-5-7513","You have everything <<1>> had when she made <<2>> go to sleep.nnI don't remember how she did it. I'm sorry. But I know she used the altars in the Constellation Room.",""
"55049764-5-7515","Aranak. After being a member of our town, living as one of us for so long, it's unbelievable that he would do something like this. Please bring him to judgment quickly, so we can close this terrible chapter.",""
"55049764-5-7517","Oh, Eranas. This is all my fault. I never should have … well, it's too late now, isn't it?",""
"55049764-5-7539","Are you going to the village to find evidence? Be careful! Who knows what manner of beasts have taken up shelter in our homes.nnI'll try to have the trial chamber ready by the time you get back.",""
"55049764-5-7540","I don't want to believe the Khajiit is guilty, but I'm not blind. I can read the signs. Lightning struck in the village the night the Green Pact was broken. The Khajiit is involved in some way.",""
"55049764-5-7541","Your deeds have been nothing short of legendary. With the Planemeld at an end, Tamriel may yet endure.nnNow, the time has come to confront Molag Bal and reclaim your soul.",""
"55049764-5-7542","Lord Varen is waiting for you. It's time.",""

"55049764-5-7811","It's a damn good thing you came out. I was just about to charge in there and find you myself. nnIf I had died, it would've been your fault. You don't want the death of a king on your head, do you?",""

"55049764-5-7892","If you can recover the Crown of Shornhelm, meet me in Hoarfrost Downs. I have business to attend to, but if you bring me the crown I'll drop everything and get it to High King Emeric.",""

"55049764-5-7902","Ah! Come to do business? To browse our fine markets, perhaps?nnYou will find things in Redfur not sold outside of Elsweyr!",""

"55049764-5-7937","So Hircine chooses to speak to you rather than us, his faithful servants. I admit to a bitter feeling, but perhaps it is for the better this way.nnProvided you do not betray us.",""
"55049764-5-7938","Hircine speaks to you. Best not keep him waiting.",""
"55049764-5-7939","Our temple is overrun with Reachmen. Our guardians have turned against us. This is all my fault, and I'll do whatever it takes to get it back.",""
"55049764-5-7940","Ah, the prodigal pup returns. So you aid the Wyrd who still lick their wounds of defeat. They fell prey to Brinarch and his Reachman, losing my favor. To earn it back, you must prove yourself once more. Show me what you've learned.",""
"55049764-5-7941","Ah, there you are at last! This daft old hermit is simply talking in circles. See if you can persuade him to be sensible. nnIf that doesn't work, have a look at these inscriptions yourself.",""
"55049764-5-7947","What can I do for you?",""
"55049764-5-7948","Countess Tamrith has returned from the west. She is understandably distraught, but grateful to you all the same. nnVerandis passed through here as well, on his way to the Lorkrata hills. I believe he was expecting to to join him.",""
"55049764-5-7960","I confess, I was nervous to come to Rivenspire, but Emeric felt it was important that he come and reassure the people, if nothing else.nnMy only condition is that we cannot leave until he crowns a new ruler. He should have done so long ago.",""
"55049764-5-7969","Nedras left me. I'd almost rather he were dead than hear he's run away and left me alone. I can't believe he's done this to me!",""

"55049764-5-7972","Kala welcomes you to her home. The bright moons watch over you.",""
"55049764-5-7977","Well, kick an Elf and call me sunshine! I know you! From Shornhelm! Am I glad to see you!nnI was the Orc. In the cage. Not my most shining moment, but it's not like I'm a noble or anything. No matter. We could really use your help.",""
"55049764-5-7985","Keep low, and remain vigilant. The Imperials are thieves without honor.",""
"55049764-5-7987","Well, what have we here? A poor lost pup, looking for a pack? Heh. You want to run with wolves, you got to learn a few things first.",""
"55049764-5-7997","Remember, only when you have collected all three pieces of the Orrery do we have even a hope of getting it working. Not like it matters to me, although I'd like for <<1>> to come back. She has much to teach me.",""
"55049764-5-7999","That's it! It's working. It's actually working!",""
"55049764-5-8004","I've lost everything ….",""
"55049764-5-8005","We can't wait any longer. She's already free of her bonds! Please, in Ruptga's name, use the talisman and release her!",""
"55049764-5-8006","What's happening? It's as if there's another presence in the ruin.",""
"55049764-5-8009","Enter the pool and touch the symbol of life.",""
"55049764-5-8012","I hope Frandar lets you pass. I also hope he has more clarity than I do.nnI wonder why anyone would want to visit the Chamber of Passage, or even the Far Shores … aren't there some shores you could visit a little closer to home?",""
"55049764-5-8014","Here is the potion. I hope Zur didn't cut any corners. But knowing him, it probably tastes terrible.",""
"55049764-5-8031","Ah! A fellow student of history? You must be. No other reason to visit these gods-forsaken ruins.nnFascinating place though. You realize this is where King Ranser made his last stand? Still haunts the place, in fact. And I intend to find out why.",""
"55049764-5-8037","Now this is more like it! I love a good battle! It really gets the blood flowing.",""
"55049764-5-8044","Given the recent troubles in the area, the people of <<1>> need a little entertainment to raise their spirits. Anything you can do to help my performers is appreciated.",""
"55049764-5-8050","You look like someone who seeks to travel while earning honest coin! nnWould you like to hear about a great opportunity for both of these ambitions?",""
"55049764-5-8068","You have my thanks for the help that you rendered unto us, and my sincere apologies that <<1>> was inflicted upon you through my absence.",""
"55049764-5-8069","Why didn't you say you were with Ufa?",""
"55049764-5-8071","I appreciate your help, but … don't think this changes anything. We're working together for the good of the Covenant. That's it.",""
"55049764-5-8072","Oh, you're still here? I don't suppose you'd be willing to help me on another grand adventure, would you?",""
"55049764-5-8078","You do the talky part. You're good at that. I'll make sure none of Naruk's crazies put a dagger in your back.",""
"55049764-5-8082","Given the befuddled expression on your face, I'm going to say you aren't Arrowhead. That means she's missing, and that's very, very bad.",""
"55049764-5-8088","I had no love for Larzgug and Thrug, but I didn't relish their deaths. I thought by leaving the stronghold I was leaving this bloodshed behind.nnAt any rate, we have everything we need to swear the oath.",""
"55049764-5-8091","Either I'm finally dead, or I'm dreaming. Either way, I want to give you a hug.",""
"55049764-5-8103","What in Mauloch's name took you so long? You think I got time to sit on my arse out here?nnThis job's hit a major snag, and I need your help!",""

"55049764-5-8272","Well done! Well done, indeed!",""
"55049764-5-8281","Consider yourself grateful the prince granted you an audience. He attends to crucial matters of state.",""
"55049764-5-8300","What do you say? Let's go find Lady Lleraya and Baron Montclair!",""
"55049764-5-8303","Why'd you tell their elder something like that?",""
"55049764-5-8304","You're like a ghost from the past, haunting me. I won't say it's entirely unwelcome, although some memories don't lie still.nnI'm raving, ignore me. What brings you here?",""
"55049764-5-8309","Going to have to figure out how to turn this gold into more jobs. Maybe we should have some handbills scribed out? Hmm ….",""
"55049764-5-8310","We rarely use written contracts, but I'm glad our seer suggested one for these men. Their deceitful ways will cause them much sorrow.",""
"55049764-5-8311","Once you find them, get them back here right away. We've got to let the elder know how we're doing. She's been waiting on our progress report. And between you and me, I think she's getting a little impatient.",""

"55049764-5-8317","Well met, friend. Tell me something. Say you knew someone who committed a truly heinous crime. You know, slaughtering innocents and such.nnCould they ever be forgiven? Or do they deserve to suffer for the rest of their lives?",""
"55049764-5-8318","If you can distract him and slip that draught into his drink, he should be snoozing pretty quick.",""
"55049764-5-8319","You are welcome to Fell's Run, traveler, but I'm afraid the town isn't at it's best right now. Perhaps you should move on and spend the night in Northpoint.",""

"55049764-5-8330","I've already spoken with the constable, and he agreed to release Martin if the young man will enlist. nnI simply can't understand why a criminal would choose the stocks over doing his duty for his kingdom.",""
"55049764-5-8333","We must be getting close. The secret of Lorkrata should be soon within our grasp.",""
"55049764-5-8341","It's time for me to make amends for the actions of my son. I shall accompany you and return honor to the Dorell name.",""
"55049764-5-8343","Just one more tile, I think. Now which one was it?",""

"55049764-5-8367","I need a little time to say my farewells. Don't worry about me. I won't do anything stupid. I promise.nnBut you need to get back to Shornhelm. Without Verandis there, they're going to need your help to figure out what happens next.",""
"55049764-5-8368","The Doomcrag towers over this place. It is inescapable.",""

"55049764-5-8372","None of these defenses were active when Montclair and I first came here. I wonder if that would have made a difference in what happened after?",""
"55049764-5-8383","Not everyone reads the burnt bones anymore. My grandmother taught me how, but it's been so long since I've done it.",""

"55049764-5-8441","All this talk of plagues and cultists. It's enough to make me want to move to Windhelm!",""
"55049764-5-8442","No one ever listens to what I have to say. Just make sure the ledgers are balanced. That's all they think I'm good for.",""

"55049764-5-8484","What are they up to in there? And why won't they let me get a look at their curative?nnOh, sorry. I didn't see you standing there through the haze of my indignation. Can I help you? No, wait! You can help me!",""
"55049764-5-8486","Sometimes when we are in the dormant state, I dream. I dream that we have another purpose, that we work with the Bosmer to rebuild this place. I hope someday that comes to pass.",""

"55049764-6-2905","I recognize that smell. I believe I tended to your hatching, child. I have not always been in these pools, but I have always been Sharith-xal. nnI do have a favor to ask of you, if you don't mind helping a blind elder scale.",""
"55049764-6-2909","We could use the help of an outsider, someone who hasn't breathed the plumes. Most of us aren't fit to hold weapons. We can only trust what we see so much. The others aren't right in the mind. Not right.nnNot like me. I'm the only sane one left.",""
"55049764-6-2910","It had to be done. It had to!nnAnd yet, my heart is heavy. The old master taught me so much. I grieve for what's happened. I would have rather defeated her to win my post than take over the school this way.",""

"55049764-6-3029","This crown is a fantastic find. I will be able to put it to excellent use!",""
"55049764-6-3030","Now we find Shiri.",""
"55049764-6-3045","There is nothing in this world I could offer to properly express my gratitude, egg-friend. My family may yet be restored from your actions.nnI wish to wait here, and see if my brothers awaken from their reverie.",""
"55049764-6-3046","You're unusual. Few who visit us have ended so many lives.nnI wonder, have you come among us as bearing a blessing of Sithis?",""
"55049764-6-3047","The Worm Cult loves their secrets. Secret caves. Secret rituals. Secret handshakes. They won't even share their recipe for roast cliff racer.",""

"55049764-6-3066","If the Shadowscale are truly not responsible for these blasphemies, then why do their kin shelter the ones who hold sway over this shrine?nnWhy do they not strike at the source of the corruption - the source of their necromantic blood?",""

"55049764-6-3083","Yes, yes! The scent is very strong here, Ma'Zarman is sure.nnGo. This one will stand watch to make sure no one disturbs you. Do what you must, <<1>>.",""
"55049764-6-3099","Do you like the Hall of Judgment? Feel free to look around. nnIt has been rebuilt a few times, but this building actually dates back to when the Ra Gada first settled in the Alik'r Desert.",""
"55049764-6-3102","Now that all the missing persons have been accounted for, I can turn my attention to cleaning up the mess Munada made.nnI can't help believing she had help with her crimes. There must be other conspirators!",""

"55049764-6-3198","Have you heard about Lillies-of-the-Moon? Some of the older pickers knew her. One day she found an enchanted piece of jewelry. Apparently it belonged to some Imperial noble. They say she moved to Stormhold and bought a mansion with the reward money.",""
"55049764-6-3205","I honor you for repairing the village totem, but I will hear no talk of this ""Worm Cult.""nnYes, I have heard of them. We work closely with the hunters, who range wide.",""
"55049764-6-3207","Remember: the dust of the witchlights that live to the north, and the bones of Ayleids that litter the ground to the northwest, between Hissmir and Loriasel.nnAnd most important, the blood of one of our own villagers, sacrificed for the good of all.",""
"55049764-6-3220","I have to say it. I'm starting to feel like Azura's using you as her champion. First at Vanne Farm in Alcaire, now here. I know I'm grateful. nnI'd say goodbye, but I'll probably run into you again in a few days.",""
"55049764-6-3226","<<1>>.nnDo not think I have forgotten your actions so easily, but perhaps we can reach an accord. My work here could use someone of your caliber, and despite our differences, our goals seem to align.",""
"55049764-6-3227","What brings you here? You don't seem to fear the swirling battle around us.",""
"55049764-6-3234","There isn't enough action in Daggerfall to keep an old soldier like me busy.",""
"55049764-6-3235","I hope you're not giving up. I'm not going to reward you if you only have the pieces. nnThe sword must be reforged, and we cannot assume the tomb will be here forever. What if it collapsed?",""
"55049764-6-3286","We've got to keep these Daedra-Pirates from heading to Koeglin Village.",""
"55049764-6-3294","I wish I could say there was no longer cause for concern. Somehow, though, I just don't think that's the case.nnSomething about all this just isn't adding up.",""
"55049764-6-3308","Well, so much for my hope that the folk in the warehouse would put an end to you.nnI'm guessing you found nothing. Like I said, it was that witch!",""
"55049764-6-3311","I wouldn't hold out too much hope, my friend. nnAt this point, I can't imagine the slavers are looking to leave here with anything more than their lives.",""
"55049764-6-3313","The people of this village have no honor. When a ship comes into port with injured sailors, it is a sacred custom that those sailors be cared for. nnTo leave my men here bleeding on the deck is unforgiveable.",""
"55049764-6-3316","The forge is closed. With the slaver attack and everything else going on, we have enough steel in the town.nnTry back another day and perhaps we can do business.",""
"55049764-6-3321","That barn has always scared me. Thanks for checking there. nnCome to the house after and let me know if you found anything.",""
"55049764-6-3329","I don't understand why the general's holding us back, or what this glorious next battle is that he keeps talking about.nnIt's not my place to question orders either, though.",""

"55049764-6-3376","I hope Thomin's plan works. I'm sick with worry.",""
"55049764-6-3377","So you have to fight the Hammerdeath champions. nnAsk around for advice. Not everyone in the Midnight Union favors the new direction.",""
"55049764-6-3379","Magnificent. I knew you'd be an exciting combatant.nnYou've bested two of the champions. Only the <<1>> remains!",""

"55049764-6-3479","We heard a scream. And then ripples of magical distortion started to sweep across the battlefield.nnWhat happened?",""
"55049764-6-3482","I couldn't help overhearing. I know the house that Granette told you about.nnI think I'll go with you. I want to make sure that Gelvin isn't having second thoughts. We really need to get paid for this job.",""

"55049764-6-5403","I can't believe I fell for that scam. I'll never live this one down.",""
"55049764-6-5406","Buried the dead as best I could. I see you found that Rilyn character. Looks suspicious to me, but Raerana is breathing easier with him here.nnWhat's that you've got?",""
"55049764-6-5416","This is one of those times I wish I could be in four places at once. Instead, I had to send my sisters <<1>>, <<2>>, and <<3>>.",""
"55049764-6-5423","So what's your answer? Care to prove yourself?",""
"55049764-6-5429","Begone, insect. I've no time for your ilk.",""
"55049764-6-5438","Damn it! Destroying the Sentinel must have triggered these wards. We'll need to find another way in. nnHmm. Maybe Cadwell can help us.",""
"55049764-6-5439","I can feel Mara's smile on my face for the first time in hours. Good luck.",""
"55049764-6-5444","Kindly step back. We have a situation here.",""
"55049764-6-5447","And how is Fistalle, my friend? Raz loves her laugh. nnWhat did she learn?",""
"55049764-6-5448","Believe me, I meant what I said. I'd happily go in there myself. But in this dress? And the nobles here would probably lose their minds.nnPlease, friend. I'd see it as a personal favor if you would investigate with the battlereeve.",""
"55049764-6-5475","Best of luck finding <<1>>!",""
"55049764-6-5477","Who are you looking at? Why don't you go throw rocks at a dog or something?",""
"55049764-6-5481","<Its empty, but looks like someone hides things in here>",""
"55049764-6-5502","You've returned! And all in one piece. What a hero!",""
"55049764-6-5537","I can't believe this is happening.",""
"55049764-6-5538","Please, find her. Find her quickly.",""
"55049764-6-5539","Please, find him. He's kind of an idiot. But he's still my brother.",""
"55049764-6-5540","Excellent work. Let's get below.",""
"55049764-6-5543","Please hurry. If my mother falls to this curse as I did … I can't bear to think of it.",""
"55049764-6-5546","Welcome to Skywatch. Your message arrived just fine and they're expecting you up at the manse.",""
"55049764-6-5547","I bid you welcome to Skywatch.",""
"55049764-6-5548","Please, follow.",""
"55049764-6-5552","Nothing's worth this nonsense. Stuff the Thalmor! And the Dominion! And—",""
"55049764-6-5553","Please take your leave. We've already reached our limit on Khajiiti students.",""
"55049764-6-5559","You claim that Gorak killed dozens of villains? And a foul necromancer, as well?",""
"55049764-6-5575","Careful. The crystal has a bite. Not always so friendly when unattuned.",""
"55049764-6-5605","Lyris sent you? She has an eye for strength, that one. I'll assume you're capable.nnAny minute, the Daedra will realize how many Soul Shriven are loose, and they'll try to bring all Oblivion down on us. I'm going to stop them.",""
"55049764-6-5608","This range brings back memories! Everyone from the village learned how to use a bow in this very place.",""
"55049764-6-5625","Good. You're here. This is Qoramir, my patrol leader. nnHe isn't having a good day.",""
"55049764-6-5629","As soon as Raynor recovers his senses, we'll make our way out of this Daedric death trap.",""
"55049764-6-5631","I won't forgive my father for this. I can't!",""
"55049764-6-5633","Quickly now, collect the skyshard so we can be gone from this place.",""
"55049764-6-5636","I want to be the Nord I used to be. I want to help my friends remember who they really are.",""
"55049764-6-5701","We don't know each other, stranger. But you have a mother's gratitude for your kindness.",""
"55049764-6-5713","Keep your wits about you and win this thing. Save us. Save yourself.nnI'm going to go and look for the others. Just … end this already. I've had just about enough of this terrible game.",""
"55049764-6-5714","Good, good! This one hoped he would find you. Mim worried that some terrible fate had befallen you.nnThere was a terrible commotion and then the Observer appeared. He seemed angry, but also kind of excited. What did you do?",""
"55049764-6-5734","Don't worry about me. Save your empathy for someone who needs it.nnI shall have no trouble making my way to this city of yours.",""
"55049764-6-5735","I should have known. What a useless gesture! Why did we even try to help you?nnLook at us! Caught like rats in a cage.",""
"55049764-6-5736","I hope this city of yours has suitable accommodations for one of my stature. I won't stay at just any ratty old inn, you know.",""
"55049764-6-5741","Are you ready to help us, outsider? Will you undertake the trials?",""
"55049764-6-5752","A Proctor doesn't concern himself with justice or right. All that matters is that things run smoothly.",""
"55049764-6-5775","<<1>> is determined to get me killed. I won't do it anymore.",""
"55049764-6-5786","<<1>> crossed the marsh with the others. This one remains until the fisher-folk are safe. It is an important task, of course, but my claws itch for battle.",""
"55049764-6-5787","It's lucky we were able to drive the slavers back this time.nnI'm worried about what might happen if they were to attack again, though.",""
"55049764-6-5790","The poison was in the well water. Even better, I know exactly what kind it is.",""
"55049764-6-5791","Without the weight of numbers, we can't retake <<1>> by direct assault. The key to victory is the fort.",""
"55049764-6-5792","I thought the Pact was full of people like <<1>>. I'm glad you proved me wrong. I won't forget your mercy, friend.",""
"55049764-6-5794","By the bloody sands of sunken Yokuda, the Daedra are here!",""
"55049764-6-5795","Have you found <<1>>? If he's working with the bandits, he may be to the north of here.",""
"55049764-6-5796","Go on. Head over to the bridge. I'll send Tzik'nith on her way. Hopefully, she won't get suspicious and alert her sisters about all this.",""
"55049764-6-5800","I can't believe it! All these soldiers and not a decent mess kit among them? If only I'd returned with some supplies.",""
"55049764-6-5808","Honor and blood. Why are you here, stranger?",""
"55049764-6-5817","When you went searching for my assistants, did you see anyone else?nnAnyone intelligent, I mean. Spectres don't count.",""
"55049764-6-5836","Sweat and blood are worth a sea of words.",""
"55049764-6-5845","<<1>>. Did you find her? Tell her to hurry back. I cannot wait to get away from this place.",""
"55049764-6-5846","The Hall of Might, then! I've been looking forward to plumbing its depths!",""
"55049764-6-5849","Lead on, friend of <<1>>.",""
"55049764-6-5851","The stones—have they been destroyed?",""
"55049764-6-5856","A good try. But we would never fall to such a simple ploy.",""
"55049764-6-5859","Two down. Only one champion left. nnIf you kill them all, I may pout.",""
"55049764-6-5863","You are not one of my servants. Your face is … familiar.",""
"55049764-6-5885","I can't believe the Guardian's Eye is nearly in my—I mean our—grasp!nnI don't know what you're planning to do with your share, but I'm buying a gold-plated carriage.",""
"55049764-6-5890","There is a captain in town planning a profitable heist. If you drop my name, she may let us join her.",""
"55049764-6-5892","Nice work back there. <<1>> found an old vent that led to this chamber. More climbing than I'd have liked, but we made it through.nnMy crew is making short work of the mutineers behind us, but there are still plenty more in the cavern.",""
"55049764-6-5893","Having that heirloom back will lift my spirits more than a cartful of dead Imperials.",""
"55049764-6-5895","Now to retrieve that staff. The door to Prince Maleel's tomb must be open now.",""
"55049764-6-5897","Aren't you finished yet?",""
"55049764-6-5898","I'll cover you and then head back to the entrance to wait for reinforcements. Don't get killed.",""
"55049764-6-5899","Captain, are there two of you standing there?",""
"55049764-6-5900","Well, now, before we start with the fun … we need to do a little worship.",""
"55049764-6-5903","Please! Byz is small and only sweeps! Do not hurt Byz!",""
"55049764-6-5908","Another successful retrieval, I see.",""
"55049764-6-5911","Moons above, she likes to talk sometimes.",""
"55049764-6-5920","We'd best be sure that Khali hasn't destroyed the ruin while we were away.",""
"55049764-6-5922","This Dwemer sphere still has some missing pieces. If you find them, I can get it running.",""
"55049764-6-5943","There is no time. The door must be opened and you must go after Wormfather. nnI'll make the sacrifice. It's the right thing to do. It'll ensure my place in Sovngarde at least.",""
"55049764-6-5947","Good to see you made it here in one piece.",""
"55049764-6-5953","What happened? I saw you enter the Temple and now you're back out here, talking to me. Does the beautiful goddess scare you? She certainly scares me!nnBut get going. Climb back on the guar and all that. Mournhold is depending on you.",""
"55049764-6-5957","Nicely done.","Ben fatto."
"55049764-6-5982","Use the Duskstone to enter the king's dream. Hurry! There is still a chance!",""
"55049764-6-5984","So, what do you say?",""
"55049764-6-5987","I've had enough adventures for one day.",""
"55049764-6-5995","I'm not sure you're supposed to be here.",""
"55049764-6-6001","Hey. You're not a guard. You have to help me!",""
"55049764-6-6032","Welcome. It's a good day to sit by the fire and cook rabbit kabobs.",""
"55049764-6-6039","Greetings, Champion.",""
"55049764-6-6042","You're the one who helped Neramo break into Bthzark, aren't you? That's the rumor anyway.",""
"55049764-6-6051","What is it? I've got some guards to hire, now that the Worm Cult is out of the way.nnBusiness can be good again!",""
"55049764-6-6065","I hope you can help <<1>> too. Fat cat won't shut up about his fields when we play cards.",""
"55049764-6-6066","Help my sister, please!",""
"55049764-6-6068","I don't know how much my sister can take of this! Don't bother with me, go help her!",""
"55049764-6-6069","It's a shame about the villagers. But they knew the risks of living with us.",""
"55049764-6-6070","Sneak attacks are a specialty of ours. Any fool can run headfirst into battle. nnA true soldier ensures victory before they even take the field.",""
"55049764-6-6071","I'm just glad to be in the field today. I was getting sick of ripping out shalk gizzards for this reagent. nnNo, never mind. I loved doing that, too. Almost as much as I enjoy killing people.",""
"55049764-6-6094","Hey, hello there friend! Can I beg your assistance today?",""
"55049764-6-6099","What? Why? Where has he gone? Kalari will drag him back here by his ears! Why would he do that to me?",""
"55049764-6-6101","You did a wonderful job with the pranks! Are you ready to party?",""
"55049764-6-6110","Good luck in there. We'll hold the line here until you return.",""
"55049764-6-6111","Good to see you again. Did you salvage anything from the Hedoran estate?",""
"55049764-6-6112","Ahh, excellent. I sensed you coming. It's good to see you again. We can set to work right away.",""
"55049764-6-6117","There is still more for you to do.",""
"55049764-6-6123","You are to help Ezzag, yes? So Tazia tells this one. Just know he is a cussed old cat.",""
"55049764-6-6124","It is good to see a friend in such a dark place.",""
"55049764-6-6126","So? Ezzag was right, right? It was not children?",""
"55049764-6-6183","The Red Rooks will scatter, now they've lost their leader. nnI wish … I wish I had never gotten involved with these bastards. I'll regret that decision always, but will try to make up for it as best I can.",""
"55049764-6-6191","The Canonreeves who authorized this invasion will be pleased we averted an absolute crisis.nnThanks to you, the heavy losses we suffered in this battle will not be for nothing.",""
"55049764-6-6197","And so, it falls to us, Vestige. We must stop Molag Bal and his Dark Anchors, or our world is doomed. nnAnd now, history seems to have caught up with us. Shall we return to the Harborage?",""
"55049764-6-6198","Please, traveler. You must help us. We've been driven from the temple, and the Claw is in terrible danger!",""
"55049764-6-6207","Few things bother me more than the thought of Goblins using our books for kindling or worse.",""
"55049764-6-6208","By the Eight, we've done it. The Daggers will live on!nnThank you, friend.",""
"55049764-6-6218","Indaenir said you might be coming. And you're here not a moment too soon. As our living soldiers fall, the ranks of the dead swell. nnAt this rate, we'll all be fighting for the other side by tomorrow's dawn. And that's not even the worst part.",""
"55049764-6-6220","Follow the torchbug.",""
"55049764-6-6233","Talmo and his banner. The dryskin fool will not shut up about it.",""
"55049764-6-6235","Hallowed … you have come, as Hunal saw reflected on the moons last night. This one sees the cool light of the moons reflected in your eyes. You have greatness in your future, yes?",""
"55049764-6-6236","If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times … no more drinking! My head's splitting, my mouth feels like a kagouti nested in it, and I'm in serious trouble.nnI don't suppose you'd care to help out a down-on-her-luck chef, would you?",""
"55049764-6-6240","I remember you! You helped us on our last visit to this evil place. Thank the Divines you returned! I need your help. It's my son.",""
"55049764-6-6252","I don't like the idea of Tharn being involved at all. He's a cockroach looking for an open cupboard.",""
"55049764-6-6254","You gave Rhea the poison? Can't trust any of you provincials.",""
"55049764-6-6261","You made the right choice by giving me the poison.",""
"55049764-6-6269","Did you charge those restoration scrolls? I need them badly.",""
"55049764-6-6285","Together, we shall restore the altars. You wield the blessings of the Bright Moons, and Rid-Thar will attune their connection to Jone and Jode.",""
"55049764-6-6286","Traveler, Felari is very sorry to bother … but could she beg your help?",""
"55049764-6-6292","I never thought it could be this bad. I'm used to being able to think through my problems. Using my books and spells to … there's no solution to this in a book.",""
"55049764-6-6301","I'm sorry to ask for your service so soon. But after the loss of the Champion at Moonmont your valor could make the difference today.",""
"55049764-6-6317","The Khajiit are a noble people. To see their jewel in the desert brought low like this … it moves my heart.",""
"55049764-6-6318","What a disaster to befall such a fair city ….",""
"55049764-6-6319","My city. My beautiful, wonderful city.",""
"55049764-6-6335","Razum-dar has relayed his suspicions to Treethane Fariel, but she has questions she would ask of you herself.nnHurry. We must go after Asteril and make sure she does not escape once again.",""
"55049764-6-6337","We have to just forgive Oromin's terse manner. He takes his position very seriously.nnSee what you can uncover at the residence. And be careful.",""
"55049764-6-6339","<<1>> is in the larger Ayleid ruins. Go quickly, before the Dominion realizes what they've lost.",""
"55049764-6-6364","You look like a proper pirate now. Get going.",""
"55049764-6-6372","It's terrible, wondering if you should trust your superiors.",""
"55049764-6-6378","So after three months of wasting time in Alcaire and three long days at sea, I finally return home. My chair, my wine, my wife, all here.nnPlease tell me you haven't come here to disturb me.",""
"55049764-6-6382","I keep waiting for the screaming to start. Did you find any portals?",""
"55049764-6-6395","You survived! Truly the Hist guides you.nnBut did you succeed?",""
"55049764-6-6409","You're alive! Cheers! I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.",""
"55049764-6-6410","<<1>> would like a moment of your time.",""
"55049764-6-6421","I can't believe it. I finally figured it out. This … this could change everything! nnOur lurcher guardians—I've found a way to give each of them special powers!",""
"55049764-6-6422","That was a harrowing experience all around. I'm glad it's over. I hope we have succeeded in weakening Naemon's grasp on Valenwood as a whole. nnOnly one thing remains … we must deal with the spirit of General Malgoth.",""
"55049764-6-6424","Bad luck. Ah well. You know what they say, ""Nothing ventured, nothing … ventured."" Hey, and at least your lizard is fit for the stewpot.",""
"55049764-6-6429","We have made excellent progress thus far, but there is still so much to do. Continue your efforts to fill this city and strengthen our army. We shall require every ally we can muster if we are to successfully challenge the Lord of Schemes.",""
"55049764-6-6436","And so it finally begins. We have waited so long for this moment, but the taste is bittersweet. We shall lose many fine men and women this day, I fear.nnMay the blessing of Meridia protect you, champion. Now, go. The Chasm awaits.",""
"55049764-6-6437","You look strong, sleek. Yes … come, come! Join the race! Try your hand at spikeball, the sport of champions.",""
"55049764-6-6440","This part's on you. I'm a dunce when it comes to magic.",""
"55049764-6-6441","I'll watch your back and smash anything that comes at you.",""
"55049764-6-6442","I say, jolly good timing. Lyris, enchanted, as always. And you—you're looking fit for someone so … how can I put it? Deficient in the soul department?",""
"55049764-6-6444","It galls me that the enemy holds the Elder Scroll of Ghartok. We must capture it!",""
"55049764-6-6448","You have caught Ezreba, miserable wretch that she is. She will not fight you.",""
"55049764-6-6456","Let the Treeminder know that you made your decision, outsider.",""
"55049764-6-6457","Find out what's happening up above yet?",""
"55049764-6-6458","Khaba is afraid your troll has been ""retired."" You will try again later, yes? Perhaps your luck will change.",""
"55049764-6-6478","So, did you find them?",""
"55049764-6-6482","You've brought Ezreba out of the darkness. Well done. And those spirits seem to have gone back to wherever they came from. What did you do?",""
"55049764-6-6483","Glow juice? You find some?",""
"55049764-6-6485","These sailors work a lot harder than I thought. We'll stick with the Prowler, if <<1>> will have us.",""
"55049764-6-6486","Praise the gods, you're back! I thought you were an alit.",""
"55049764-6-6487","Did you find any glow juice? I got some sand in my wounds. Don't ever do that, even by mistake.",""
"55049764-6-6506","Imagine Tamriel without Goblins. Well, I can dream, can't I?",""
"55049764-6-6509","<<1>>'s plan is to let <<2>> possess him! They'll both be sealed in the tomb, forever.nnBut it doesn't need to be this way. Seal me inside.",""
"55049764-6-6510","<<1>> clearly has an opinion about my plan. I've learned it's best to hear her out.",""
"55049764-6-6514","That was fast. All right, there's room on the Prowler for your marine friends, as long as they work for their meals.",""
"55049764-6-6515","Teleportation was never this difficult before. The spell took so much out of me, I was afraid we would never materialize. But Zur has the key to this room. He acquired it shortly after we got here. Were you able to craft the antipodal rods?",""
"55049764-6-6586","Please … help me. The crystal. I can hear them in my head!",""
"55049764-6-6590","You think this one drinks on the job? Good, then so will everyone else.nnWhat is the word, my new friend?",""
"55049764-6-6591","I hope you find what you seek in this tower. I often wondered what was inside, but I never dared to enter the place.nnRemember, friend, we are allies now! When you require my help, all you have to do is ask.",""
"55049764-6-6593","We've done it! Once they saw Gavo's confession, most of them abandoned the city. They're running home to Colovia. The only ones still fighting are her loyalist core. How'd it go with Lavinia?",""
"55049764-6-6594","I can already hear them talking out there. We're so close, I can taste it.",""
"55049764-6-6597","I don't have time for you right now. The Prowler's damaged and unless we get some help, she'll founder at high tide.nnYou want to help? Talk to <<1>>.",""
"55049764-6-6599","Where is former Ambassador <<1>>?",""
"55049764-6-6601","We upheld our treaty with the people of <<1>> for generations, and this is how they repay our kindness?nnWe will not allow High Elf thieves to gain a foothold in our territorial waters!",""

"55049764-6-6607","You again? Don't tell me you're serious about competing in the Sorcerer Division Championship. You'll be eaten alive!",""
"55049764-6-6609","Ah, my greenhorn friend is back and ready to have some fun. Did you bring a change of underthings?",""
"55049764-6-6610","Welcome back, lovely! Zara wondered when you would return. She missed you terribly. nnThe other contenders should thank Jone and Jode that championships are not won by physical attraction. Your sleekness would best them all.",""
"55049764-6-6614","Champion of the Swordmaster Division? You are a surprise!",""
"55049764-6-6615","You watch. Someday, these lands will be called Driladan Valley. The Spinners will even tell stories about us, and how we defended our lands and preserved the clan.",""
"55049764-6-6618","I sense the time to reforge the essences of the Great Mage has arrived.",""
"55049764-6-6629","A great man lies dying over there, and he has put all his faith in you. I hope it is not misplaced.nnI have finished mixing the potion for your initiation. Whenever you are ready, we can begin the trial.",""
"55049764-6-6635","I wasn't expecting any of the Shadow Walkers to be here. They haven't attacked yet, so that's a good sign. nnJust don't do anything to make them nervous, all right?",""
"55049764-6-6636","Thank you for helping me fulfill my promise. With <<1>>'s death, I showed mother I will follow in her footsteps.",""
"55049764-6-6640","By the Root, what happened here? I'd like to hear Nervyna's explanation.",""
"55049764-6-6660","The Dwemer ruins are further down the tunnels. Stay close. The automatons are everywhere.nnThere had better be some money to be made from this.",""
"55049764-6-6661","I arrived with a few other wizards. Conjuration masters. We helped open the portal to Coldharbour.nnUnfortunately, we didn't arrive where we expected. A defensive countermeasure, I think. Molag Bal's forces were upon us in an instant.",""
"55049764-6-6667","I trust you to get the information we need. However you see fit.",""
"55049764-6-6674","Ifriz is never far from his beloved barrier. Hurry and end this so that we can both get on with our existences.",""
"55049764-6-6675","The forbidden books remain. Please, bring them to the shrine so they may be purged once and for all.",""
"55049764-6-6686","This one does not understand. This shrine is supposed to be lit with an ever-burning flame!nnPerhaps <<1>> has thrown good money after bad.",""
"55049764-6-6701","We keep meeting in the most interesting places. Now, if only we weren't always fighting for our lives, that would be something.nnAnyway, thank you for setting us free.",""
"55049764-6-6705","This one has felt the blazing embers of Daedra torture. They attempt to destroy the mind and body together.nnWe must find my brother before we lose Kargand forever.",""
"55049764-6-6706","Well? What are you staring at?",""
"55049764-6-6733","Hail. I'm Erunor, the Caretaker of Shrouded Vale. We can use your aid if ye'll give it. Wood Orcs have swarmed the Vale, and the Fading Bushes that sheltered our village have withered away.",""
"55049764-6-6734","I should get back to our inspection. If you see anything suspicious, it's your duty to let us know. Fires don't start themselves.",""
"55049764-6-6735","My father, he keeps shaking. Why is he shaking?",""
"55049764-6-6737","Declare: Are ye friend? If friend, then help us. The Wood Orcs invade our Vale and we return, after a thousand years' absence, to find the Fading Bushes which guard our village withered away.",""
"55049764-6-6756","I hope you know what you're doing. But just to be clear, I'm helping you, not the Crimson Matron over there.nnThat said, destroying the Harvest Heart is now our primary concern. I'll prepare this area while you help her start her ritual.",""
"55049764-6-6757","I was told you were coming.",""
"55049764-6-6761","Put everything in the circle and we'll begin.",""
"55049764-6-6773","My children will oppose us every step of the way. As long as the Harvest Heart continues to hold them in its grasp, they have no choice.nnProtect me from them, and I promise I will set them free of Molag Bal's evil!",""
"55049764-6-6789","Hmm. You know, that elixir was actually pretty tasty. They never mention that in any of the texts.",""
"55049764-6-6790","Ugh, that elixir. I can't get the taste off my tongue. Do you feel more enlightened? I just feel a little sick.",""
"55049764-6-6791","Well done! You reversed the flow of energy. Find the other conduits and let's return the stolen life force to that poor creature.",""
"55049764-6-6794","You should eavesdrop on the party guests and find out what they have planned for Aranias.",""
"55049764-6-6800","My comrade, I am very glad to see you again.",""
"55049764-6-6806","Valenwood's soil is, not surprisingly, very fertile. These specimens are bound for the royal gardens.",""
"55049764-6-6811","Still here? You're welcome to stay as long as you like.",""
"55049764-6-6822","Welcome aboard. Glad to have some new blood around. My fellow Guild mates can be stifling sometimes.",""
"55049764-6-6831","Hurry along now and see if you can find another way in.",""
"55049764-6-6835","Please, stranger. I'd like to drink alone right now.",""
"55049764-6-6847","I heard the commotion out there, and somehow I knew it was you. I can't tell you how good it is to see you, my illustrious friend.nnAs you can see, we are in dire straits here, and it's on the verge of getting much worse.",""
"55049764-6-6858","Good luck in there. Raz would not face a vision quest for all the moon-sugar in Elsweyr. But he is sure you will do fine.",""
"55049764-6-6870","Tales of today's battle will undoubtedly be told for generations! When soldiers of the Aldmeri Dominion face impossible odds, they will not retreat. nnThey will say ""remember the Battle of Seaside Sanctuary"" and they will press on, to victory!",""
"55049764-6-6887","I believe that the injustice done to Zariya has kept her spirit from making the journey to the Far Shores.nnI hope that if you perform this act of consecration, it will bring her the peace she deserves.",""
"55049764-6-6919","Cariel has been updating this one on your work in Arenthia. Very nice. Razum-dar is impressed.",""
"55049764-6-6931","I feel ashamed about what just ranspired. But I feel there is nothing we could do about it.",""
"55049764-6-6939","That fool has no idea of the danger you have put him in. I can sense the ghosts approaching even now. Tu'whacca forgive him … and you.",""
"55049764-6-6953","I'm glad you're here. I've been trying to help these poor people, but it's futile. There is a blight here that's turned them into rabid beasts.nnThese Bosmer may be beyond aid, but we must find a way to stop the blight from spreading.",""
"55049764-6-6954","Oh, hello. You're not from Willowgrove. You're … looking through my things. Can I help you?",""
"55049764-6-6967","Malooc take Gudarz and his thugs. I'm about fed up with this place.",""
"55049764-6-6968","Ah, welcome. I'm entertaining a guest at the moment. Is there something I can help with?",""
"55049764-6-6969","Can't talk now, wayfarer. I have to make sure our recruits don't hurt themselves with the sharp ends.",""
"55049764-6-6971","Oh, hello! This mead is delicious. Did you know that bees made drinks? I didn't either.",""
"55049764-6-6978","It was all a trap! Who does things like that? I took off my clothes to get ready for the celebration and the sisters attacked me! They threw me in this cage and walked off with the key.nnAnd I'm naked!",""
"55049764-6-6981","What a stubborn, pig-headed fool Stibbons is! Can you talk some sense into him?",""
"55049764-6-7005","You ever get the feeling that you were meant to do something important?nnMe neither. But this … this could come close to that. We stop the Planemeld and save the people of Tamriel. Who wouldn't want to be remembered for doing that?",""
"55049764-6-7009","The Champions are here. They awaited your arrival with great enthusiasm! Are you ready to join them within?",""
"55049764-6-7015","Just look around until we figure out a way to either open that gate or get around it.",""
"55049764-6-7027","<<1>> has put up the dowry? Excellent!nnWe're finally getting somewhere.",""
"55049764-6-7029","Whoever you are, I'm not in a talking mood. Leave me alone.",""
"55049764-6-7035","Are you here to help arrange my daughter's marriage? She's got her mother's spirit! And her temper.nnSo! What does <<1>> expect in a bridegroom?",""
"55049764-6-7039","Auri-El grant me strength. I hope you're the one Indaenir spoke of.",""
"55049764-6-7042","Head to Knife Ear Grotto, in the eastern mountains of Deshaan. I will meet you inside.",""
"55049764-6-7043","Incredible. I've never seen such terrible power. But you didn't flinch.nnThe Shade is gone, but his corruption is not. Look at the Heart. It's overflowing with corruption, spreading the darkness all over Valenwood.",""
"55049764-6-7046","Soldiers and barricades aren't exactly a welcoming feast. But unless the Argonians are willing to speak with us, they won't stay in <<1>> for much longer.",""
"55049764-6-7058","We should hurry. If any of <<1>>'s hunters attack Dominion soldiers, my tribe is doomed.",""
"55049764-6-7066","I will pay whatever you require. Just help me. I will give anything to get her back.",""
"55049764-6-7068","Meet me at my house. It's at the edge of town, past the smithy.nnI'll tell you everything I know. See you soon, I hope.",""
"55049764-6-7070","He wants you to use that magical toy on the totem that's covered in lightning? Good luck, I guess.",""
"55049764-6-7071","Hmm. I would definitely heed <<1>>'s advice about the puddles.",""
"55049764-6-7075","We can't get to the crystals!",""
"55049764-6-7108","Well, little mortal? What are you waiting for? Must I hand you an engraved invitation?nnGet inside and do what you came here to do!",""
"55049764-6-7118","Can't say I'll miss throwing back wave after wave of Wormies and their bony minions. But now I have a chance to see the world! Meet new and interesting people!nnOnly now I won't accidentally smash everything in my path. Rather embarrassing, that.",""
"55049764-6-7119","I thank you for your sacrifice, friend.nnI am … fading. Tamriel is pulling me back.",""
"55049764-6-7122","I certainly hope the real afterlife is better than this abomination.",""
"55049764-6-7123","That last assault nearly toppled us.nnBut you look alive. You've handled one of the fronts, I take it? I need the other end of town cleared of Daedra.",""
"55049764-6-7125","Suronii says this is not Coldharbour, but a ""wound between planes."" This one is glad. If this were Coldharbour, this one would be in nightmare landscape and subject to the tortures of Daedra.",""
"55049764-6-7139","If you're looking to buy something, you've come to the right place.",""
"55049764-6-7147","This one wishes there was more that could be done. Indaenir is certain you're the key.",""
"55049764-6-7154","When Raz told me about Hectahame, I couldn't get here fast enough. Now I can't even get inside.nnTo top it off, this Vinedusk won't leave me alone. Boys.",""
"55049764-6-7158","I need you to promise me you'll make the Daedra pay for taking Elolir.nnHe was a fool, but he was our fool. If you need an extra hand I'll pick up where Elolir left off.",""
"55049764-6-7159","Gilraen and her archers can hold the barrier at the center of town, but the north and south fronts are crawling with Daedra.nnThey'll close in on her if we don't stop them.",""
"55049764-6-7161","<<1>> is using you to test his theory!nnHave no fear. I'll tend any wounds you sustain.",""
"55049764-6-7194","This is going about as well as I expected, unfortunately.",""
"55049764-6-7214","These three will never reach an agreement. I swear, the head that wears the crown always seems to swell like an overripe melon.",""
"55049764-6-7228","Return to me once you've spoken to the legends of the Redguard people.nnMake your choices with care.",""
"55049764-6-7230","Have you seen Erinel, my betrothed? She's been kidnapped, and these guards won't let me pass!",""
"55049764-6-7231","What a rousing adventure! I wonder what else awaits intrepid knights such as we?nnI think I'll commission a ballad to describe our exploits. How do you feel about iambic pentameter?",""
"55049764-6-7235","You can help me, or you can leave, but I will avenge the Faithful.",""
"55049764-6-7296","Pretend we're old friends catching up after a long absence. I don't want to blow my cover just asking for help.",""
"55049764-6-7323","There's more to be done, though. Always is, isn't there?nnI know Prince Azah is out hunting down the Ansei Wards. You should help him if you are able.",""
"55049764-6-7341","Save your breath. I will not be swayed by some Altmer lapdog.",""
"55049764-6-7343","This Queen of yours is spirited, I'll give her that. But she has no right to force her will upon all of Tamriel.",""
"55049764-6-7344","Your King needs to stop talking out of the side of his mouth. He has a lot of Dominion blood on his hands. We're not going to easily forget that, and we're certainly not going to fight by his side in Coldharbour.",""
"55049764-6-7407","The loss of the Staff of Marbruk troubles me. If Pelidil is behind it, he could also be involved in the theft of my brother's body.nnFor now, we must tackle problems we can solve.",""
"55049764-6-7408","Please return to the sacred cave and escort the convicted to the judgment chamber, advocate. The town can't move on until you do.",""
"55049764-6-7411","I am grateful that you believed in me. I wish I could say the same of the others here. Many still believe I am guilty, even though the forest has returned to normal.",""
"55049764-6-7412","Treethane Rolon will want to talk to you, outsider. I don't see why. We already know who's responsible for this mess.",""
"55049764-6-7423","Sancre Tor? Never been there, but I understand it's where the Reman dynasty is entombed.nnWhy do people even bother burying remains anymore? Seems rather a waste of time these days, what with everyone popping up from their graves. Cremation, I say!",""
"55049764-6-7430","I never thought it could be this bad. I'm used to something I can pin down and fight, you know? Something that my blade can solve. No blade can solve this.",""
"55049764-6-7445","I'm glad you proved me wrong, advocate. Losing our Spinner would've been unthinkably difficult on us all.",""
"55049764-6-7447","You aren't the first to be fooled by Gathiel. Eranas was fooled and it cost him his life.",""
"55049764-6-7451","Did you notice the tiger skulls on my wall? They belonged to a senche couple who stalked Khenarthi. Took me the better part of the year to track them. Tell me, stranger, have you ever seen tigers of such size?",""
"55049764-6-7452","If he makes one wrong move, just one misstep, I'll end him. You have my word.",""
"55049764-6-7464","We're under attack! The Orcs have attacked!",""
"55049764-6-7465","About time you got over here, old chum. Exercise is all well and good, but if I keep this up much longer I'll be useless in the actual battle!",""
"55049764-6-7468","Welcome back, Vestige. News of Mannimarco's demise spreads far and wide. Like worms, his followers burrow deep into the earth to escape the searing light of the coming dawn.",""
"55049764-6-7469","You've returned. We have a lot to discuss, but Lord Varen is anxious to speak with you first. We'll talk later.",""
"55049764-6-7470","Be welcome, my friend. I would have words with you, but my lord seeks your attention first.",""
"55049764-6-7471","Don't look at me. Varen called this meeting. Apparently he's got something to share. I, for one, am all aquiver with anticipation.",""
"55049764-6-7472","This is momentous. Our actions today will be remembered for many generations, my brother.",""
"55049764-6-7476","The enemy has held the Elder Scroll of Altadoon for far too long. Help us take it from them!",""
"55049764-6-7478","Kasura is injured. We must help her.",""
"55049764-6-7494","Hallowed! A pleasure. May the light of the Bright Moons bless and keep you.",""
"55049764-6-7503","All the Covenant rejoices that the Elder Scroll of Altadoon is now ours!",""
"55049764-6-7506","Some of the acolytes must still be alive. They must be.",""
"55049764-6-7508","Sai's alive, but he's far from safe. We need to hurry!",""
"55049764-6-7511","At least we know that Sahan is still breathing. I suppose we should press on.",""
"55049764-6-7512","When Sai Sahan has recovered, you must accompany him on a journey to the Valley of Blades, where his mentor Kasura resides. n nI will contact you as soon as he is ready to travel.",""
"55049764-6-7513","Once we find all the pieces we need, we can go to the Constellation Room. Then we'll make sure <<1>> sleeps for good!",""
"55049764-6-7515","It's never an easy thing to see, but justice must be done. I will pray for him.",""
"55049764-6-7517","I knew Aranak cut that flower. He always had a poor respect for our customs.",""
"55049764-6-7539","I'm sorry, I can't talk to you right now. I need to get this chamber ready for the trial.",""
"55049764-6-7540","I wonder if we can trust each other again after this.",""
"55049764-6-7541","Here we are, Vestige, in the belly of the beast. And each of us carries within us, an Oblivion of his own making.",""
"55049764-6-7542","No matter how this ends, I'm proud of how far we've come, and what we've accomplished.",""
"55049764-6-7543","Courage, my friend. That is the most important of all virtues. Courage is not a lack of fear, rather, it is the realization that there are things more important than fear.",""
"55049764-6-7545","You should speak to the treethane. I … I'm still trying to understand all of this. It's just too terrible to think.",""
"55049764-6-7548","Friend, you picked a bad time to come here. Nothing's right, right now. Nothing at all.",""
"55049764-6-7551","Someone's pissed all over the Pact. Unless you're of a mind to stick your nose into our business, better to just move on.nnI'm thinking about it. Better than dealing with all this nonsense.",""
"55049764-6-7557","Another relic of great power, destroyed. All because evil can't let us have nice things.",""
"55049764-6-7560","It looks like the switch that opens the door is broken. No matter. I don't think we're back in our world anyway.",""
"55049764-6-7561","There is something sinister going on in Rivenspire, five-claw. Keep your wits about you and stay fragrant. What you saw here is only the beginning.",""
"55049764-6-7583","Arkay sent you! Gods bless you.nnPlease, please help! It's Marcel.",""
"55049764-6-7588","What a disaster! These monsters need to pay for what they did to our town.",""
"55049764-6-7591","It seems Renoit is a bit … upset. Please, pay him no mind. He doesn't know what he's saying.",""
"55049764-6-7603","Why did this terrible thing happen to Moira's Hope? I've never been so scared in all of my life!",""
"55049764-6-7609","We didn't even have a moment's warning. By Arkay, the vampires. They struck so fast.",""
"55049764-6-7613","We should really stop whoever's causing this storm, shouldn't we?",""
"55049764-6-7615","I see you've reacquainted yourself with <<1>>. Unacquainted? Unrequited!nnThere there … she'll come around to you. Like I did!",""
"55049764-6-7619","That stupid Captain Janeve! She threw me out of the camp! Wouldn't listen to a word I had to say!nnYou need to go in there and warn her. This isn't a refugee camp. It's a banquet table for bloodfiends!",""
"55049764-6-7622","Mannimarco has been watching our every move. We led him right to the amulet!",""
"55049764-6-7623","As my old Lieutenant used to say, ""If all else fails, fight dirty!""",""
"55049764-6-7624","Are you ready to return to <<1>>?",""
"55049764-6-7625","How goes the Goblin killing, comrade? Sebazi hopes to hear good news.",""
"55049764-6-7626","It is good to see you again. Has your contract against the Goblins been fulfilled?",""
"55049764-6-7627","How did things go against the Goblins? I don't see any ears on your belt, but maybe you don't collect souvenirs.",""
"55049764-6-7628","Perhaps you can convince Tharn to reveal Sai Sahan's location. He refused to speak to me.",""
"55049764-6-7630","Now that I'm safe, all I can think about is what comes next. Moira's Hope is the only place I've ever known.",""
"55049764-6-7636","Had I known it was going to be this hot, I would have dressed for it.",""
"55049764-6-7646","By the Eight! Having your soul reinserted is just as painful as having it ripped out. At least I'm whole again. A reintroduction is in order!nnI'm Gasteau Chamrond—you won't find a better artisan this side of Oblivion. Mad Architect included.",""
"55049764-6-7697","Did you hear that? Was it a frost troll?nnWe should get to <<1>> as soon as we can.",""
"55049764-6-7699","I knew I could count on you! If you find that blasted cup, you will have my eternal gratitude.",""
"55049764-6-7700","Well that was the first—and the last—time we allow an outsider to take part in one of our rituals. I don't know what's gotten into Rashan.nnAll the same, I must confess that I misjudged you. I hope you accept my apology. It's rarely given.",""
"55049764-6-7701","Grisly as it may be, don't forget that I need the old hag's heart.",""
"55049764-6-7719","Be careful, she has <<1>>!",""
"55049764-6-7732","The ring is yours. Guard it well. I must return to my students to begin the long task of rebuilding.",""
"55049764-6-7734","Wait, you there! I'm not a … not a Goblin!",""
"55049764-6-7748","It would seem that in his own mind, our friend Sai never really left the Halls of Torment.",""
"55049764-6-7752","Curse these Reachmen. The Eight give us the strength to beat them.",""
"55049764-6-7757","Disturbing to say the least. So the Dark Witnesses would turn us all into their puppets to reinforce their army and take Evermore. nnWe can't allow that to happen.",""
"55049764-6-7758","Another distraction.",""
"55049764-6-7765","Try not to let that Baandari skeeve out of doing his part. Those damn cats have an excuse for everything.",""
"55049764-6-7768","I'm sorry, I'm retired.",""
"55049764-6-7771","I had a feeling coming here was going to be bad for business. Always trust your instincts! I should have listened to my mother more often.",""
"55049764-6-7791","Twelve curses for a flybitten shaveskin! I should never have listened to <<1>>. This is what comes of trusting a thief!",""
"55049764-6-7792","The Countess will speak to you. I must consider how best to deal with the traitorous Baron Montclair.",""
"55049764-6-7794","I returned to Shornhelm after my father's death to find a city divided and our land in peril. Baron Dorell means well, but he'd rather rush forward than take a moment to examine the path ahead.nnBut what brings you to Rivenspire, friend?",""
"55049764-6-7802","Best of luck, fellow Moon. What <<1>> has asked of you is no simple thing.",""
"55049764-6-7805","My good friend! You have done so much for us, and asked so little in return. If all my agents were so skilled and selfless, we might bring our services to the world!",""

"55049764-7-6337","Razum-dar explained how we were fooled by Laryaril. nnI wish I had time to show proper gratitude, but he also told me that an army of Maormer, led by Vicereeve Pelidil, is making landing on our shores. Is this true?",""
"55049764-7-6339","We can't let the Dominion have the keystone. It's too powerful.nnOnce it's in our possession we can shift our focus to taking back this town. Is there anything else?",""

"55049764-7-6448","The crystal … you must destroy it! Quickly, or everyone will die!",""
"55049764-7-6456","The challenge grounds are to the west of the Hist tree. You will find our champion waiting for you there.",""

"55049764-7-6478","The Black Daggers are a cunning bunch. You look like you can handle yourself though.",""
"55049764-7-6485","Marines do their part. No privateer will accuse us of shirking duty.",""

"55049764-7-7343","Your Skald-King has all the patience of a bull at mating season. This is a negotiating table, not a battlefield. Can't you talk some sense into that thick head of his?",""

"55049764-7-7452","It's done. I hope it brought Yahyif some peace.nnI'll admit. Didn't do much for me.",""
"55049764-7-7464","I'm just gathering everyone before the ceremony starts. Go on ahead. The path is obscured by vines, but you'll see it where the passage narrows. See you there!",""
"55049764-7-7465","Every muscle must be properly stretched before we rush into battle. Wouldn't want to get a cramp when we make our heroic charge into death's chomping maw, would we?",""

"55049764-7-7627","Goblins are nasty brutes. You watch yourself on the hunt.",""

"55049764-7-7697","<<1>> was certain she'd find <<2>> beneath <<Ac:3>>. She made the Falinesti Faithful dig for that frozen vault. It seems they have uncovered it.nnAnd it would certainly explain the frost trolls.",""
"55049764-7-7699","Ah, look who's here, Stibbons! While I've no idea why you'd be in this place, I daresay you've come at an opportune moment.",""
"55049764-7-7700","Keep your distance, outsider. The last thing we need is some rock-brained city-dweller bumbling around.nnDarkness dominates this part of the forest—Uela the Hagraven and her Reachmen are encamped here. For now, at least.",""

"55049764-7-7771","I had a feeling coming here was going to be bad business! Always trust your instincts. I should have listened to my mother more often.",""
"55049764-7-7791","Take care. That the Tomb of Anahbi remains undisturbed in this city of thieves after all these years should tell you all you need to know of the dangers.",""
"55049764-7-7792","The Countess is young and unproven. Yes, she was invaluable in our victory over Montclair's forces, but is she really ready to govern? She lacks the experience and boldness of her father.",""

"55049764-7-7809","I would never bring an outsider into my memories if I didn't believe it was imperative. nnThe memories we will revisit. They are … painful for me. It is with a heavy heart that I ask you to embark upon this journey with me.",""
"55049764-7-7811","I quite forgot how it feels. The rush of blood to the head; the sound and fury of battle! nnSo what if I've put on a few years? This is where I belong. I'm going to take back this garrison or die trying.",""
"55049764-7-7828","Leila doesn't have much time. I know it. She knows it. She's trying to be so strong, but ….nnI swore I would never ask this of you. It goes against everything I believe in. But damn it, she's my wife! I don't want to lose her.",""
"55049764-7-7833","I need to think about what I'm going to do next.",""

"55049764-7-7852","So … what do you think of the armor? I'm still officially in mourning of course, and I don't want to disrespect Eamond's memory, but if we're fighting Septima Tharn I have to be there. nnI just do.",""
"55049764-7-7858","Have you discovered the identity of the informer?",""

"55049764-7-7892","Without you this may have taken days, maybe weeks, to crown a new king. Emeric really trusts you.",""
"55049764-7-7929","You're a bold one, to approach so fearlessly.nnGive me a good reason to speak with you. I'll make it seem like you're here at my request. Otherwise, my subjects will think you cut the line and start sizing you up for dinner.",""
"55049764-7-7930","The ratification ceremony is taking all of my time. Now I have to clean <<1>>'s mess?nnWe should have brought stonemasons from the Summerset Isles. Dependable, unlike these local work crews.",""
"55049764-7-7937","Cut out her heart. And work swiftly, so the blood of Hircine's faithful still flows.",""
"55049764-7-7938","The heart. Quickly!",""
"55049764-7-7941","The gargoyle's tongue! Of course, what a simply obvious answer!nnWell, let's get on with it. You'll be able to dispatch one of those beasts, I assume?",""
"55049764-7-7948","Shornhelm may be secure, but reports from other parts of the kingdom suggest Montclair is stirring up trouble everywhere.nnCountess Tamrith and Baron Dorell will each take a detachment of the Shornhelm Guard and go investigate these reports.",""

"55049764-7-7999","Strange to see you, after <<1>>. Not bad, just … strange. But no matter.nnI can hardly believe we're about to breathe some life into this old girl. And before you ask, yes, I'm speaking of <<c:2>>.",""
"55049764-7-8004","Stendarr be kind. I hope they're both still alive.",""
"55049764-7-8005","It pains me, but we cannot take her pleas to heart, my friend. The Daedra will try anything. Speak to it if you want, but you know what we have to do.",""
"55049764-7-8006","Tu'whacca's breath. What have we done ….",""
"55049764-7-8009","Mother Lamae wants to speak to you.",""
"55049764-7-8014","The power crystal should be right inside the Overseer's atelier. Just be careful. If the Overseer is present, he won't be very happy to see you.",""

"55049764-7-8072","Aha! I knew I recognized you from before. You retrieved that relic for me, from the site in the Alik'r. Splendid.nnI don't suppose you'd be willing to help me on another grand adventure?",""
"55049764-7-8088","This architecture … it's Daedric. I think it'll work.",""
"55049764-7-8103","Look, I don't know you, but I need someone who knows more about magic than I do, and frankly, that's just about anyone, so you'll do.nnThis damn mage hired me to do a job and now he won't let me get the job done!",""
"55049764-7-8272","Old chum! What have you been up to, then? Lots of derring do, I'd imagine? A fair dose of swashbuckling, perhaps? Excellent!",""
"55049764-7-8300","Did you hear what that monster did to the town of Crestshade? Reezal-Jul has to pay for these crimes!",""

"55049764-7-8318","Argh! My head is pounding. Three loaves of bread and I'm still foggy. I don't care what happens. Remind me to never drink that rum posset again.nnYou were asking around town though. About that toothless runt of a constable. Did you learn anything?",""
"55049764-7-8330","Have you made any progress with Martin? I hope you won't give up. For my sake, and for the sake of Shornhelm. We need soldiers.",""
"55049764-7-8333","Lleraya put a lot of effort into this veil. She really wants to keep us from finding whatever the Ayleids hid down here.",""
"55049764-7-8341","According to my waste of a son's own journal, he practically gave Lleraya the keys to the city. What happened here was Ellic's fault.nnI don't care what kind of powers Montclair's daughter possesses. A Dorell must be better than that!",""
"55049764-7-8343","I always loved puzzles as a child. I just hope we don't get struck by lightning if we make an incorrect decision.",""
"55049764-7-8346","You've done it! Arlie, she's … she's alive!",""
"55049764-7-8347","You are surely one of the Aedra, sent by Stendarr himself!nnBut that's silly, of course. Was … was it Federic who brought you? I'd worried he'd forgotten me.",""
"55049764-7-8348","I don't know how much help I'll be, but lead the way.",""
"55049764-7-8350","The Daedra! They took my little girl! Arlie. Have you seen my Arlie?",""
"55049764-7-8455","I never really liked this place when it was just a crypt, but between the quarantine and the plague husks it's gotten so much worse.nnLet's get moving. The sooner we figure out what's going on and find my brother, the sooner we can get out of here.",""
"55049764-7-8493","I appreciate you doing this for me. Talk to Nilyne. Just try to ignore her sharp tongue and insulting tone. That's just her way.nnShe really is an excellent alchemist. My uncle trained her, you know.",""
"55049764-7-8494","Who are you? How do you know about the Fading Tree?",""
"55049764-7-8497","I'm glad to see you and Aerona were successful. That young woman's got more guts than she knows what to do with, but I can't fault her intentions.",""
"55049764-7-8572","I'll admit, I thought you were a goner when you went inside, but glory goes to you—for now. nnOnce Roaring Ramavel and the other Undaunted get here, I'm taking it right back. I'm the best!",""
"55049764-7-8625","Let's see, that's everyone from the Iron District, but we still have a few hundred unaccounted for.nnOh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there. Our hands are full getting refugees out of the city.",""

"55049764-7-8656","I sense that the gems have been recovered. But your work is not yet done, mortal.",""
"55049764-7-8657","We are pleased that you have decided to help us, mortal. But take care—the Serpent will surely discover your interference and try to stop you.",""
"55049764-7-8658","Quick! we have to defeat this Lodge member. They can't tell the others that they found us here.",""
"55049764-7-8659","Well, I guess it's time to get ready for a party.",""
"55049764-7-8660","Thanks again for saving me from that damn prison. It feels good to be able to stretch my legs again.",""
"55049764-7-8667","The cypher must be around here somewhere. Keep an eye out for it.",""
"55049764-7-8703","That's definitely a basic dagger, good work.nnIf you wanted to you could even go back to the Blacksmithing Station and try to extract the original metal out it. Of course, you lose quite a bit in the process but it's good practice.",""
"55049764-7-8704","Those wounds are appalling. What have these mages secreted away up there?nnDon't tell me. I'll find out for myself once Brulo gets here.",""
"55049764-7-8705","Once we can take out the leader, they won't be back.",""

"55049764-7-8720","She's upset. What happened out there?",""
"55049764-7-8721","Steal the uniform, meet me by their makeshift bar. I'll have my disguise ready by then.nnLook for it up by whatever big building they've got. Maybe a laundry enclosure?",""
"55049764-7-8738","Let's get out of this cell block. We've got to make our way to the spellplates.",""
"55049764-7-8739","All right. Gwenneth's fine. Let's get out of here.",""
"55049764-7-8740","Just like Gwen to play the long con. Let's get out of this cell. We've got some spellplates to steal.",""
"55049764-7-8742","The light streaming in from there is a security hazard. I told him to block it off, but it looked ""pretty"".nnAnyway, listen close, this one's tricky.",""
"55049764-7-8745","It's good to see you again! I have grown older, Talaya has grown craftier, but I don't see you've changed at all.nnI wonder if you're ready for another challenge. Our latest course is inspired by one of the greatest couriers of all time!",""

"55049764-8-4924","I can't imagine what awaits you in the dreams of King Jorunn.nnHis dreams turn to nightmares. What once was pleasant is now twisted and dark. You must help him overcome these trials.",""
"55049764-8-4926","That's it! The Ritual of Unbinding!nnBe careful. The Drublog used it when they attacked us. <<1>> weakened when the shaman read from it.",""
"55049764-8-4927","What's Sariel saying about a cook? My head's still ringing.",""
"55049764-8-4956","The Worm Cult infests that place. We will need every warrior when the time comes to strike.nnFor now, speak to Holgunn One-Eye. He needs your help.",""
"55049764-8-4964","My friend! I was certain you'd arrive. And it's a good thing you did. All is not well in Silvenar.",""
"55049764-8-4976","We still aren't any closer to finding my husband.",""
"55049764-8-5020","You've never let me down, so don't start now. Save King Jorunn, hero.",""
"55049764-8-5028","Who are you, then? Another spy from the Jarls? Eh? Sent to put a knife in me, I'll wager. Well? Speak, dog!",""
"55049764-8-5036","You think me a peddler. That I'm not a threat. You don't know me, but you will.",""
"55049764-8-5037","Are you mad? Now I wish I'd wasted my life stabbing things or learning magic. If I had, we'd be having a different conversation!",""
"55049764-8-5046","The necromancers pulled <<1>> away! What could they want with her?",""
"55049764-8-5051","This one greets your return, comrade.",""
"55049764-8-5087","Are you ready to travel to <<1>>?",""
"55049764-8-5096","She and Aelif await you at the hall in Stormhold. Go well on your path.",""
"55049764-8-5108","With <<1>> dead and the Worm Cult shattered, perhaps peace will return to our lands.",""
"55049764-8-5110","Without you, the Worm Cult would've succeeded.nnYou saved Malabal Tor from the bloody curse of Mauloch. And you saved me when you didn't need to. I will never, never forget your kindness.",""
"55049764-8-5111","Valaste is working the problem out of the Shornhelm Guildhall.  See you there, Adept.",""
"55049764-8-5128","I hope you've had as much luck as we have. Is the Drublog's leader dead?",""
"55049764-8-5129","Good day! Have you come to worship with me? So few do these days.",""
"55049764-8-5135","Let's see these clothes, then. Rejmina is deft with needle and thread, should they need adjustment.",""
"55049764-8-5140","<<1>> is a clever little lizard. If anyone can find a way past their magics, she can.",""
"55049764-8-5145","Keep moving.",""
"55049764-8-5163","I made a bet with Hanthaerin on the way back to camp. Did you find the runes?",""
"55049764-8-5175","<<1>>, the lighthouse keeper, was spared. I don't think they considered him a threat. nnHe says the Maormer are using the lighthouse beacon to send messages to their ships. We can't wait for reinforcements. We need to take action, now.",""
"55049764-8-5183","Did you taint the Black Daggers' food?",""
"55049764-8-5205","The final hurdle is ahead of us. Are you ready?",""
"55049764-8-5238","Look, I'll head to our camp when the Houndsmen aren't looking. How about you kill a few? That'll distract them.",""
"55049764-8-5264","You are a true friend to the Baandari.",""
"55049764-8-5268","<<1>> is off limits. You're going to want to get yourself back to the main road.",""
"55049764-8-5269","Hold, there. Firsthold is under siege. We'll need you to head back to the main road.",""
"55049764-8-5270","Stars above. Glad to see a friendly face. You're one of Raz's agents, aren't you?",""
"55049764-8-5305","The barriers fall, and our victory will be in sight.",""
"55049764-8-5323","Got your bearings yet? I could use your help, if you're done poking around.",""
"55049764-8-5324","This will not do. Something here is very wrong.",""
"55049764-8-5344","There's just something not right about this.",""
"55049764-8-5401","Can't believe the lengths some folks will go to for a little treasure.",""
"55049764-8-5406","See if you can find this Rilyn character. Even if he doesn't know anything, it wouldn't hurt for Raerana to have someone to help her through this.",""
"55049764-8-5423","I'll make sure news of the Maormer is passed on to the appropriate parties. Don't you worry about that. Now, what's your name? I'll need it for the official register.",""
"55049764-8-5438","This place is an abomination. You can almost feel the hatred emanating from every rock.",""
"55049764-8-5439","Thank the Eight and all the Stars in the sky. You've got to help me. nnI can't keep them contained much longer.",""
"55049764-8-5447","Ah. This one was just thinking he wanted some company.",""
"55049764-8-5448","Fair day, citizen. I'm sorry, I'm making last minute notes for my speech. I'll be happy to talk as soon as I'm done.",""
"55049764-8-5538","Please, you have to help me. They've got my daughter. My Palith!",""
"55049764-8-5540","Ah, good! I'm famished. Let's see … I'd like a breast of pheasant, some wine, and a wheel of cheese.",""
"55049764-8-5543","I never properly thanked you for coming in when you did. I might still be hiding out there, in the woods.nnAnd my mother … well, it's no use thinking thoughts like that.",""
"55049764-8-5548","Looking for Razum-dar? Follow th—me.",""
"55049764-8-5553","Sorry, I'm far too busy and important to speak with you right now.nnRun along.",""
"55049764-8-5559","So Gorak exaggerated, then? He was wounded when you found him?",""
"55049764-8-5608","Here we are, back where we began.nnIsn't it amazing how often we travel to distant places, only to end up right where we started?",""
"55049764-8-5625","It hurts.",""
"55049764-8-5629","I can't believe they blundered right into this trap. How stupid was that?nnAs usual, I guess it's up to us to save the day.",""
"55049764-8-5631","My father can rot here, for all I care! We'll gather what we can and head for the Hollow City shortly.",""
"55049764-8-5633","Come. We must hurry to the Anchor mooring!",""
"55049764-8-5713","You … you got all of us out?nnI don't know how, nor do I care. You are amazing.",""
"55049764-8-5714","You must pick Mim! Do not select that one over there.nnHe is evil. Pure evil! Do not make such a terrible mistake.",""
"55049764-8-5735","I just need a moment before I head out. Everything that's happened has been so sudden.nnThat and my head is still pounding from whatever Estre gave me.",""
"55049764-8-5741","The time has come to end the suffering. I pray that the cursed shard crumbles at your touch.",""
"55049764-8-5786","We will drive the Jackdaws from <<1>>. With <<2>> here, I have no doubt.",""
"55049764-8-5790","Yes, I'll have the poultice ready in a moment.nnWait, who are you?",""
"55049764-8-5795","What have you found?",""
"55049764-8-5796","The lamia needs to calm down and back off. I can provide more help to the Khajiit than she can.",""
"55049764-8-5800","I left the inn to pick up supplies. Now, look at me. Trapped in a house with a bunch of suicidal soldiers.nn<<1>> would know what to do.",""
"55049764-8-5817","I'll return <<Ac:1>> to <<Ac:2>>, don't you worry.",""
"55049764-8-5846","Nice to sit down again. I suppose I'd have rotted away if you hadn't come along.",""
"55049764-8-5851","You smell like someone who's been in an Ayleid ruin. Did you find anything in Vahtacen?",""
"55049764-8-5856","If it is not one thing, it is another.",""
"55049764-8-5859","You're a thrilling performer. I'm really quite stimulated. nnBut you knew that about me. Didn't you?",""
"55049764-8-5885","My crew and I are collecting Dwemer samples to, uh … sell them. You should explore. nnNow that I've seen this place, I'd guess the Dwemer were not kindly creatures. Only a sadistic culture would build the constructs and traps we've encountered.",""
"55049764-8-5890","The crystals are the key. The door itself would easily open if I could only—hello!nnI hope you're not planning to rob me. I've nothing of value and you might not like being incinerated.",""
"55049764-8-5892","You work fast. <<1>> found us and told us what happened. All we had to do was follow the trail of corpses and disarmed traps.nn<<1>> said you went after the treasure that had <<2>> so worked up. Did you find it?",""
"55049764-8-5893","Did you find him and deliver my orders?",""
"55049764-8-5895","This place is incredible. The ancient Redguards were a noble and accomplished people.",""
"55049764-8-5897","All done? Very good.",""
"55049764-8-5898","Good, you're here. I found this little runt snooping about. I was just about to put him out of his misery.",""
"55049764-8-5900","Ha ha ha. The looks on their faces! Dollie ran so fast, I thought she'd fall on her face. And that old cat, chasing his tail! Oh, thank you. I haven't laughed this hard in years.",""
"55049764-8-5908","I see you have the fork. nnCompetently done. Impressive, even.",""
"55049764-8-5911","If Khali were not holding the doorway, she surely would have the barrier down by now.",""
"55049764-8-5920","Well done, well done. Khali is even impressed with you. This one did not think that was possible.",""
"55049764-8-5953","About time you showed up. I was going crazy waiting out here.nnThis place isn't exactly on my list of favorite places to hang out, you know.",""
"55049764-8-5957","You're heading the wrong way, aren't you? Everyone's fleeing Velyn Harbor but a few diehards.nnWait … you don't look like the running type. Perhaps you can help us defend the city.",""
"55049764-8-5982","You are truly favored by Azura. Wherever you go, and whatever you do, I hope you will not take her blessing for granted.nnI should add that, personally, I am honored to have walked at your side in her light. nnMay she continue to watch over you.",""
"55049764-8-6065","Hello? Who's there? Tazia? Tell your busybody Clanmatron I'm not here.",""
"55049764-8-6066","Hallowed … we are here. Within the walls of Moonmont.",""
"55049764-8-6068","This place reeks of corruption. Hallowed, this temple is unclean.",""
"55049764-8-6069","Any day we can share victory over our enemies is a fine day. When there's the smell of burning bodies in the air, it just makes the day that much finer. Thank you, soldier, for making my day.",""
"55049764-8-6070","Very good, soldier. Looks like you're ready to come with us on the next mission.",""
"55049764-8-6099","What happened? Was Mathal in Rakhad's house?",""
"55049764-8-6110","Well met, traveler. Good to see a friendly face out here. You look like the capable sort. Would you be willing to do some aggressive message running?",""
"55049764-8-6123","This one feels confident that you will be a great help to S'ren-ja. Only the wisdom of a Clanmother could see that kind of potential in you.",""
"55049764-8-6126","Ahh … on second thought do not bring Ezzag a severed head. He would almost certainly throw up.",""
"55049764-8-6197","Ah, the empty one returns.nnYour pardon, but, bereft of your soul, that's how I think of you. Don't be offended: I hope to repair your lack.",""
"55049764-8-6207","The only good Goblin is one that's been minced to pieces and then the pieces smashed with rocks.",""
"55049764-8-6220","I appreciate the Mane's sentiment … and the support of the Dominion, but ultimately, it falls on us to protect Valenwood. nnSince the Silvenar's death, I get the sense that Queen Ayrenn feels she owes us something, but we Bosmer are not helpless.",""
"55049764-8-6233","Leave this place. There are enemy troops in town and we need no more trouble here.",""
"55049764-8-6252","Just need a minute to catch my breath.",""
"55049764-8-6269","Did you stop the Dremora reinforcements? We're barely surviving the ones here already.",""
"55049764-8-6285","Be calm in the moonlight. And welcome to Do'Krin. You tread upon ancient stones here.",""
"55049764-8-6292","The texts never made it sound … like that. What we did. We killed the Silvenar! The heart of the forest, the Green Lady is dead.",""
"55049764-8-6301","Fancy meeting you here! I keep hearing all these reports out of the March. ""Hallowed this"" and ""the Hallowed did that."" Even on the fringes of the Dominion, you make your mark. With another city ablaze, I'm glad you're here.",""
"55049764-8-6335","This one looks forward to pouncing upon an unsuspecting Pelidil. This nonsense is becoming tiresome.",""
"55049764-8-6337","I'll send word to the other clans and to Queen Ayrenn in Marbruk. If the Maormer are attacking in force, we are going to need all the help we can get.nnI just hope we can hold out until some help arrives.",""
"55049764-8-6339","You must be the one <<1>> spoke of. Our agents owe you their lives.",""
"55049764-8-6364","Have we met before? Hmm ….nnNever mind.",""
"55049764-8-6382","Did you find them? Are they still alive and fighting?",""
"55049764-8-6409","Ugh … my head.",""
"55049764-8-6410","Welcome to <<1>>. If you plan to leave us with a small fortune, please show up with a large one!",""
"55049764-8-6422","Did you hear the voice …? He called this the ""Shadow Wood"". It seems to be some dark realm that parallels Valenwood. nnIf the Shade of Naemon has created this, he's more powerful than I realized. This is … horrifying.",""
"55049764-8-6429","You made it this far, just as I had predicted. I am glad to see that my calculations were not in error.nnNow, if you are ready, we have a prison to break out of.",""
"55049764-8-6440","Let's not tell any bards about this part of our adventure, agreed? This is not what I want to be remembered for.",""
"55049764-8-6441","So yeah, that journal. Gives me an idea.",""
"55049764-8-6444","I long to see the Elder Scroll of Chim in Dominion hands.",""
"55049764-8-6448","Oh, hello there. What can Ezreba do for you?",""
"55049764-8-6456","I saw what you did, outsider. Your convictions must be powerful indeed!",""
"55049764-8-6457","If Aruz comes out of this dead, I might just break into a smile.",""
"55049764-8-6478","Good to see you again. What's the word on my supplies?",""
"55049764-8-6485","These aren't Dominion sailors, they're privateers. Just our luck.",""
"55049764-8-6506","Is it done?",""
"55049764-8-6509","If <<1>> is truly in danger, we should tread carefully.",""
"55049764-8-6510","Thank you, friend. I need a moment to recover. If you wouldn't mind disabling the traps, <<1>> can make it through without fear of perforation.",""
"55049764-8-6514","You aren't a slick-arsed Sea Viper or a cabbage-mouthed castaway. State your business with the crew of the Prowler.",""
"55049764-8-6515","The end draws near. It was an interesting and unexpected journey. That's how I prefer to look at things.",""
"55049764-8-6590","Complete your duties on the island with all haste. When you are done, return to this one and we will deal with the Maormer.",""
"55049764-8-6591","We shall help you enter the tower. But first, you must help us against these foul Wood Elves. Do not listen to their lies!nnThey murder our children! For no reason! Please, you must help me save the little ones!",""
"55049764-8-6593","Good luck out there. We'll get the troops ready to go.",""
"55049764-8-6594","I knew he'd be the weak link we needed. Well done.",""
"55049764-8-6599","Your friend <<1>> showed me what you found, but the treaty binds me! Unless the ambassador himself was involved, I am powerless.",""
"55049764-8-6601","The Dominion's invasion of <<1>> will not end well.",""
"55049764-8-6602","No wine. Stringy meat. My beloved Silvenar, cooling these squabbling children instead of warming our bed.nnIf there's a more tiresome place in all of Tamriel, I haven't found it.",""
"55049764-8-6614","Keep winning Division Championships and you may get your chance in the main arena!",""
"55049764-8-6618","The thieving vampires can be found throughout this area. Please be quick about it and hurry back.",""
"55049764-8-6629","I am still mixing the ingredients. You will have to wait. nnIt takes great patience to be an Ash'abah. You might as well start getting accustomed to it.",""
"55049764-8-6635","Go on! See what my father has to say.",""
"55049764-8-6640","What in Oblivion happened here?",""
"55049764-8-6660","About time someone showed up. Thought I'd die here under a pile of kwama.",""
"55049764-8-6667","I'd start with the dragons. The Pact only ships their dullest, weakest soldiers off for diplomatic guard duty.",""
"55049764-8-6705","This one remembers you. You fought Canonreeve Oraneth with us.nnWe failed to stop her ritual. The final altar was in this Daedric realm all along. We need to find it. Destroy it. At least you survived. They killed Dracien to mock Bakkhara.",""
"55049764-8-6734","So, any luck? Did <<1>> mention anything about the fire you didn't hear from me?",""
"55049764-8-6756","The blood you placed has set the reverberation aspects for my ritual's spell matrix. Now I'm ready to unleash the magic to fill the matrix and power the ritual.nnJust make sure nothing interrupts me while I'm working.",""
"55049764-8-6757","Bright Moons hang above us, child. What brings you all the way out here?",""
"55049764-8-6761","There you are. I was beginning to think you were captured.nnWe've a bit of a problem, I'm afraid.",""
"55049764-8-6773","I hope that you will prove to be more reasonable than your companion. My offer makes perfect sense, considering the alternatives.",""
"55049764-8-6789","You are our Hallowed, yes? It is good to meet you. I've heard of some of your adventures, asked around. You seem very wise … I hope we have a chance to talk later.",""
"55049764-8-6790","So you are to be the Hallowed, yes? Good, you look like a strong one. It is a pleasure to meet you. I'm certain we will learn much of each other here in the temple.",""
"55049764-8-6791","Lead on. I'm right behind you. Let's see what secrets this installation holds.",""
"55049764-8-6794","Andur intends to kill you. You should see he doesn't.",""
"55049764-8-6806","Hail, chosen of the queen. We have been expecting you.",""
"55049764-8-6831","The knowledge we will obtain from the soul of this creature will be immensely beneficial.nnI can think of five different potions I'd like to attempt from Selene's aura alone. Glorious!",""
"55049764-8-6919","Get gone, my friend. Don't keep the moon-sugar-induced visions waiting.",""
"55049764-8-6931","Thank you for everything. Now I can lead my people along the true path. By the light of the moon, I hope I can guide them to where they should go.nnOn behlaf of the Khajiit people, we thank you for everything you've done. Moon Herald.",""
"55049764-8-6968","Apologies, traveler. This isn't the best time. If you're here to talk about buying some mead, Donniel will help you out.",""
"55049764-8-6978","<<1>> always sets out a wonderful spread. The food is excellent! Even better than my cooking, I must admit.",""
"55049764-8-6981","<<1>> is trying to deceive you. If you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you, I'll help you see through their illusions.",""
"55049764-8-7009","We will enter the temple together, Hallowed. You are sure you are ready to begin the trial?",""
"55049764-8-7015","Remember, we need you to close that reinforcement portal before you unlock the Labyrinth. As long as the portal is functioning, Molag Bal has the ability to overwhelm us with Daedric forces.",""
"55049764-8-7027","Who are you? You don't look like one of the Ungodly.nnWait, are you here to help the matchmaker? Because that's me!",""
"55049764-8-7042","Ah, excellent, you got my message. Apparently, that little creature isn't completely useless. Banekin can be such children.nnI hope you've nothing pressing. We could be here a while.",""
"55049764-8-7043","Let's get inside.",""
"55049764-8-7046","I imagine it will take a few days to pack this tribe up and escort them out of <<1>>.nnI'll make sure it's done with dignity.",""
"55049764-8-7058","I was dreaming of speckled fish. Now I'm hungry and wet. Explain yourself.",""
"55049764-8-7068","Who knows how long those fiends kept the harpies agitated, just to take advantage of this town?nnIf I hadn't returned when I did, and gotten your help, they'd continue to terrorize my people and these harpies.",""
"55049764-8-7070","The wizard seems agitated. We need to drain those <<m:1>>.",""
"55049764-8-7071","<<1>>'s theory is arguably sound. We should channel the energies from the <<m:2>>.",""
"55049764-8-7108","The Labyrinth key is in the chest, little mortal. Take it and be about your business while I'm still inclined to be friendly.",""

"55049764-8-7194","Let's get to the summit point. Lead on.",""
"55049764-8-7214","I'm just here as security. You should talk to the great mage, Vanus Galerion.",""
"55049764-8-7228","Speak to the legendary Redguards found around this shrine.nnYou'll learn much about yourself.",""
"55049764-8-7235","You there. You're not one of these savages. Free me, quickly!",""
"55049764-8-7407","It is good you have come. The Bosmer here have yet to swear loyalty to the Dominion, and our enemies seek to sway them. Worse, the Staff of Magnus was stolen from Marbruk before I arrived.nnI hope you will aid the Dominion in this dark time.",""
"55049764-8-7423","I understand you visited the Halls of Torment? Marvelous place. Marvelous. I'm not a fan of the tortured screaming, but otherwise it's quite lovely.",""
"55049764-8-7430","The monks never made it sound … like that. We killed the Silvenar! The heart of the forest, the Green Lady is dead.",""
"55049764-8-7447","If you're not here to help, leave us alone.",""
"55049764-8-7451","You're one of Brackenleaf's Briars now. You're free to come and go, but whatever you do in the world reflects on us. Don't make me hunt you.",""

"55049764-8-7464","Wait!nnAh, you're not one of those Wood Orcs, thank Y'ffre! Welcome to our humble home!",""
"55049764-8-7476","How is it that the Elder Scroll of Mnem still remains in enemy hands? Where are the Pact's brave warriors?",""
"55049764-8-7478","They will pay for the innocent lives they have taken!",""
"55049764-8-7503","The strength of the Elder Scroll of Mnem belongs to the Covenant now!",""
"55049764-8-7506","I don't understand. I observed all the proper protocols. How could so many have … have perished?",""
"55049764-8-7508","The shield's down! Let's get her!",""
"55049764-8-7511","Another doppelganger? I didn't think Titanborn could be less appealing. Looks like I've been proved wrong. That's a first.nnPerhaps if we take out that shield we can release Sahan.",""
"55049764-8-7513","Stop! Don't make me go back. I was so close to escaping him forever!",""
"55049764-8-7515","It's unfortunate that Aranak needed to meet such a terrible end for his crimes, but his lesson will help others avoid the same fate.",""
"55049764-8-7560","What did I tell you! Worked like a charm!nnMoved us right into a parallel version of our world where the way through the ruins isn't blocked. But keep that runestone handy. We might need to use it again.",""
"55049764-8-7609","You have given me much to consider. Unfortunately, I fear such thoughts may keep me up at night.",""
"55049764-8-7613","We won't make it inside my laboratory unless we can stop the lightning.",""

"55049764-8-7625","Greetings, comrade. The Fighters Guild has entrusted Sebazi with contracts, if this is of interest.",""
"55049764-8-7626","I greet you, comrade. The Fighters Guild has contracts to offer in Cyrodiil. Would you like to hear of them?",""
"55049764-8-7627","The Fighters Guild is helping out here in Cyrodiil, trying to reign in the chaos. Interested in a contract?",""
"55049764-8-7628","Do not judge me too harshly. I will spend the rest of my days making amends for what I have done.",""
"55049764-8-7646","If Reynelle remains here, she'll be just up ahead.",""
"55049764-8-7697","Who is Lady <<1>>? Was that truly <<2>>? He seemed rather obsessed with her.nnWe must get to the bottom of this.",""
"55049764-8-7699","Look, Stibbons, it's our friend … you know, the one who helped us in Alik'r! How good to see you again, and at such an opportune moment too.",""
"55049764-8-7701","Here I was, just starting to feel like you're one of the pack, and now we have to part ways.nnObviously, I'll have to be the one to break the wards on the door. It doesn't seem fair. You get to go in and chew the old hag's face off.",""
"55049764-8-7719","I've been trapped here for so long. To feel the sun upon my face again … just to think of its indulgence.",""
"55049764-8-7732","May the blessings of Stendarr go with you, my friends.",""
"55049764-8-7748","My goodness, undead! How unexpected. How utterly original. Bloody necromancers.",""
"55049764-8-7765","There's a sight for a sore eye! Someone who looks like they can spill blood for a righteous cause!nnThe Imperials have just about licked us. I've only got a few knights left who are fit to fight. I've had to recruit Baandari to defend the camp!",""
"55049764-8-7791","Thanks again. Jode's Chariot regards you as an honorary member.",""
"55049764-8-7794","Baron Dorell can be so reckless. I fear that his approach will lead Rivenspire down a dangerous path.nnOf course, his style of leadership hardly matters if we can't put a stop to Baron Montclair.",""
"55049764-8-7802","What you have done is unforgivable, but it will not stop us.",""
"55049764-8-7805","I am sorry, but managing an organization of this size takes time. Please. Return later and we may talk.",""
"55049764-8-7809","I apologize if the scene before you makes you uncomfortable. I did not expect you to arrive during our meal time.nnAs for why I kept my true nature hidden? Well, let's just say that Emeric insisted. And one does not refuse the High King lightly.",""
"55049764-8-7811","Just so you know, while you're slogging through sewage, we won't be napping out here. nnWe'll go ahead and assault the main gate. It'll create a good distraction. It'll also mean that if you fail, we'll all die. Just so you know.",""
"55049764-8-7828","This will work, my old friend. We're going to save Leila, I just know it!",""
"55049764-8-7858","Remember, seek out Sahil at the inn. But tell him Adusa sent you, or he might try to kill you or something.",""
"55049764-8-7929","The Aldmeri Dominion is a reality, but it's still quite young. We must remain its caretakers so it may flourish into adulthood.nnI'm glad <<1>> shares my views.",""
"55049764-8-7930","I'd expected you would solve problems at the embassy, not cause them! Do you realize what's happening out here?nnNever mind. Explain what you were doing in that storeroom.",""
"55049764-8-7937","<<1>>'s sacrifice should be the extra edge we need to call upon Hircine.",""
"55049764-8-7938","Wyress Nyronie is brave to undertake such a task.",""
"55049764-8-7941","Off with you, now! If the Goblins have their dinner before you administer the potion, why, who knows how long we'd have to wait for them to ingest it?",""
"55049764-8-7948","The bickering of nobles. It can try even the most stoic king's patience. But at least Tamrith and Dorell have the kingdom's interests at heart.nnBaron Montclair has gone well beyond the extent of my patience, into the realm of loathing, I think.",""
"55049764-8-7997","With Daraneth returned to Elden Root and the Heart of Anumaril at hand, only a divine spark remains.",""
"55049764-8-8004","Tall Papa, help me …. What have I done?nnPlease—you must help!",""
"55049764-8-8005","Adeena? She must be here somewhere ….",""
"55049764-8-8006","Listen to me. Wayfarer, please. That is not my sister—not anymore. You can't believe its lies. It's … it's manipulating you!",""
"55049764-8-8009","We share the blood of Mother Lamae. We are now kin. I will watch out for you from the shadows.",""
"55049764-8-8014","The end draws near. It was an interesting and unexpected journey. That is how I prefer to look at things.",""
"55049764-8-8068","You've done me a great service in returning me to my vigil.",""
"55049764-8-8069","Finally, we can return to our normal way of life without entertaining any more Imperials than necessary.",""
"55049764-8-8072","I don't suppose you'd be willing to help me on another grand adventure? nnI won't accompany you on it, of course, but I'll be there in spirit nonetheless!",""
"55049764-8-8088","Place the heads on the pikes around the dais. Then I'll begin the ritual.nnBrace yourself. This could be … unpleasant.",""
"55049764-8-8272","Go on, then. Simply reach out and touch Meridia's Light. You'll be whisked off to new adventures, quick as you please!",""
"55049764-8-8303","Come on, help me out of this mess. I've been stuck for hours.",""
"55049764-8-8310","The winds bring us strange tidings. Fortunately, we can always find a way to cope.",""
"55049764-8-8311","You're a true friend to us. We'll never forget you!",""
"55049764-8-8318","You're a really good person for helping me. I hope you know that.",""
"55049764-8-8330","While we're waiting for Shuga to finally get here, what do you say to taking on the most unlikely prospect of the bunch?nnIf you can recruit this young man, I'll eat my dagger. He's … awkward.",""
"55049764-8-8333","Go ahead and examine the tear. The veil may hinder me, but I believe you can guide us through here.",""
"55049764-8-8343","I pray to the Light that we have the will and the strength to end the threat of Baron Montclair.",""
"55049764-8-8346","Do you think we'll be all right, going through there? I have to admit, all this fire and brimstone business. I'm a bit … flustered.",""
"55049764-8-8347","Thank the Eight! When we found the portal closed, I feared the worst.",""
"55049764-8-8348","A thrice-damned hero, you are. If my ribs weren't so bruised, I'd give you a hug!",""
"55049764-8-8455","Something is very wrong here. Where did all these plague husks come from?",""
"55049764-8-8493","About what I said. About kissing you on the lips. You know, that was just the heat of the moment, right?nnAnyway, thanks again for your help.",""
"55049764-8-8497","Now that you're here, I'm sure Dethisam is going to make it. Even Aerona seems glad to see you, and she's rarely happy to see anyone.nnTalk to Nilyne. She'll tell you what she needs.",""
"55049764-8-8572","They say something terrible has awoken—or occupied—Hel Ra Citadel, abandoned by the Yokudans since they invaded Tamriel.nnScholars have been disappearing inside since the door to the Citadel, sealed by the Yokudans for thousands of years, opened.",""
"55049764-8-8638","You want to help? Prove it. Kill <<1>>, who guards the entrance to the enclave. Help me avenge my sisters, and in doing so, we will prevent the savages from attacking the outside world … your world.nnThat is their aim.",""
"55049764-8-8648","I was up in that tree for hours! Damned senches. Thank you for the assistance, stranger, I—It's you! nnYou helped me before—saved my village. What brings you back? I—nevermind. I need your help again. Will you give it?",""
"55049764-8-8656","Find the gems that power the Seeker's Sight and we may still foil the Serpent's plans. Start your search north of this settlement, and good luck to you.",""
"55049764-8-8657","You have restored the gems to the Seeker's Sight. Good. But we are running out of time. The Scaled One has found another of our aspects. We felt her turn.nnHe is creating a corrupted version of ourselves—and this Lost One grows ever stronger.",""
"55049764-8-8658","That was a close one.",""
"55049764-8-8659","Did you have fun rescuing Gwenneth? You're now her hero, you know.",""
"55049764-8-8667","…..",""

"55049764-8-8705","Let's get these Lodge members out of here.",""
"55049764-8-8707","Banu expects the dagger, a blade in the darkness. Instead, I'm wielding you. Delicious!",""
"55049764-8-8721","This is the place. Secret listening post for the Aldmeri Dominion. We're here to steal disguises and some official-looking paperwork, on enchanted paper with magicked ink, so we can break into the prison for Gwen.",""
"55049764-8-8738","That's unfortunate. They closed the door behind us. Guess we have to go the long way around. It's all right, though: We're just trying to spirit away one of their hardenedinmates. I'm sure they'll just let us through.",""
"55049764-8-8739","Gods, they closed the door on us. We've got to find our way back to the spellplates.",""
"55049764-8-8740","The door's closed behind us. Great. Let's keep moving. I think I have a plan to get us back to the spellplates safely.",""
"55049764-8-8742","Hurry and get that release valve. I'm not climbing up there.",""
"55049764-8-8745","It takes both skill and good fortune to enter the ranks of the Black Horse Couriers!",""
"55049764-8-8808","See you on the other side.",""
"55049764-8-8809","Go see what Danni has to say.",""
"55049764-8-8810","Hmm, this doesn't look good.",""
"55049764-8-8811","Finally! I can't believe the amount of time you waste on sleep!",""
"55049764-8-8830","What have you discovered?",""
"55049764-8-8831","See you in Abah's.",""

"55049764-8-8898","I overheard those assassins talking, before you arrived.",""
"55049764-8-8925","I'm glad you made it! I don't think the runescriber or armorer will see reason any better than the trainer. I'm afraid the time for talk is behind us.nnLet's go dismantle an army!",""
"55049764-8-8931","Damn it! I'd rather die fighting than be stuck down here. The Temple may be lost, but we mustn't lose heart!nnGood will always triumph over evil, and Molag Bal's minions are no exception. We can stop them, I tell you. We must.",""
"55049764-8-8933","Find the cave and destroy the wamasu eggbearer. Just remember not to reveal my involvement. Neither of us will benefit if the Scaled Court discovers my betrayal.",""
"55049764-8-8942","Friend, have you come across Kelmen in your travels?nnThe Thief reported a magical disturbance around Skyreach. Kelmen went to find an old Mages Guild associate he said was working in the area. He has yet to return.",""
"55049764-8-8943","Regent Cassipia and Little Leaf wanted to change the world, but the cost was too high.nnThe Serpent, the Viper … whatever you call it, a snake is still a snake.",""
"55049764-8-8947","A Daedric prince whose name starts with an 'M'! Bet you never have to deal with that kind of threat.",""
"55049764-8-8949","Have your experiences with the dark magics of the Daedra warped your perception of time? Do you not want your reward?",""
"55049764-8-8954","I prefer to work with maple. It's reliable, plentiful … rarely full of wasps.",""
"55049764-8-8966","Once you return with the ingredients, we'll determine whether you know how to combine them.",""
"55049764-8-9020","The source of the heat must be behind that door. We need to find a way to unlock it. Perhaps the rings on this mechanism move ….",""
"55049764-8-9039","Well! I knew you didn't sound like a spider.nnBut please be careful about what you smash. These machines are of great historical and scientific importance!",""

"55049764-8-9180","New to the city, are you? Yes. The Rat can tell by your scent—clean with no fear. Everyone else here reeks of their own waste.nnThey made sport of the Rat, but now the Daedra make sport of them. Now they need help, and no one cares.",""
"55049764-8-9267","Quickly, now! We must not let Lyris's sacrifice be in vain!",""
"55049764-9-6","Did you get it? Oh, let me see! I know that if Khalisah made it, it has to be beautiful.nnShe's amazing.",""
"55049764-9-49","The men took heart in your courage. They came back emboldened and ready to fight.",""

"55049764-9-485","We meet again. What news?",""
"55049764-9-529","Durak is in a deep sleep. He does not respond to your hail.",""
"55049764-9-539","Please, make yourself comfortable. As long as this place is not being used, I might as well use it myself.nnMy associates and I are known as the Ravenwatch. Perhaps that's a bit grandiose, but our purpose is deadly serious.",""

"55049764-9-606","On second thought, maybe I'll stick around for awhile and make sure no one picks up where Marienne left off.",""
"55049764-9-607","Oh, thank the Divines! Your timing is impeccable, my dear.nnI've made a dreadful mistake, getting involved with those nasty graverobbers! Just look at what we've done! But now that you're here, we can set things right.",""
"55049764-9-623","For aiding our dear Prince you have my sincerest thanks. He is a strong leader, but who among us can stand alone in times such as these?",""

"55049764-9-4856","Hmm. These runestones aren't powerful enough. Perhaps the summoning ring would respond to some type of imbued gem.",""
"55049764-9-4859","Could be worse. We could've come out in a cistern.nnYou should get to it. We can't stay hidden long.",""
"55049764-9-4860","So much bloodshed! Curse Mauloch, curse the Drublog! May they suffer a thousand deaths!",""
"55049764-9-4867","My father must be stopped at all costs. He's already targeted the Winterland hunters. He's about to turn them into his puppets.nnJaruk downstairs can tell you how to save them. That's our first step.",""
"55049764-9-4889","Hi there. It's great to see someone who isn't made of metal and trying to chop me to bits.nnAre you just exploring? I hate to tell you, but we were here first. But good job getting this far without one of Raynor's crazy devices.",""
"55049764-9-4894","Three of my comrades remain somewhere in these halls.nnThey serve as Keepers under me, sworn to guard the High Kinlord's prison for as long as they are able. Find them … and help them, if they live.",""
"55049764-9-4904","<<1>>? I don't know him, but I'll bet he's that arrogant-looking Green Hunter across the way.",""
"55049764-9-4913","Looks like everyone's mostly in one piece. Only one we're missing is Sal. Of course. I bet he's hiding in one of these buildings.nnWe've got to move before the Shrikes regroup and attack. Maybe we'll go with <<1>>'s plan after all.",""
"55049764-9-4916","Do you think this is a test of some kind? I'm not sure why the Daedra would pick this moment in my life ….",""
"55049764-9-4926","Their shaman ensnared the Silvenar. His book drained the Silvenar's essence, immobilizing him.nnThe last thing I saw, the shaman took the tome toward one of their Daedric shrines.",""
"55049764-9-4927","Is that the Ritual of Unbinding that Sariel was talking about? It looks … strange.",""
"55049764-9-4964","My friend! I was certain you'd arrive. And it's a good thing you did. All is not well in Silvenar.nnThere's a barrier in place, invisible to the naked eye. Its energy keeps me out of the city.",""
"55049764-9-4976","Oh! You startled me! nnYou look a capable type. Are you a sellsword? I need someone to help me get past the barricade inside the crypts.",""
"55049764-9-5020","Be careful, you hear?nnI'd hate to see someone I … respect … get hurt.",""
"55049764-9-5036","If we were in the Ashlands, I'd have you clapped in irons on one of father's plantations!",""
"55049764-9-5037","He steals everything he sells. It makes sense he'd hire bandits to ambush me.",""
"55049764-9-5046","I'll pray for <<1>>.",""
"55049764-9-5087","Experiencing the insanity of others? I do hope the experience doesn't have any lasting effects.",""
"55049764-9-5096","She and Aelif await you at the hall in Marbruk. Go well on your path.",""
"55049764-9-5108","Our alliance has never been stronger thanks to you, but your work is not complete.nnI have a message for you—from Vanus Galerion of the Mages Guild.",""

"55049764-9-5111","Valaste is working the problem out of the Stormhold Guildhall.  See you there, Adept.",""
"55049764-9-5128","I've sent word to the militia to gather here. Once they're together, we'll head toward the warehouse district.nnMeet me at the bridge after you've killed the Drublog chief.",""
"55049764-9-5135","We must close the net, and quickly. If their second courier arrives from Colovia, we'll lose the advantage you've given us.",""
"55049764-9-5140","Well, what is it? I'm organizing our defenses here. If you need supplies, talk to Garri in the Tapped Vein.",""

"55049764-9-5163","Good luck. We all need it.",""

"55049764-9-5183","The Black Daggers understand nothing but force. Harsh measures are called for here.",""
"55049764-9-5205","The Ebonheart Pact armies are assembled. It's time to defeat <<1>>!",""
"55049764-9-5264","The Baandari owe you a great debt, my friend.",""
"55049764-9-5269","I don't know how much longer we can keep this up. If we can't get those portals closed, the first hold of Auridon may fall.",""
"55049764-9-5323","Easy there, little one. Don't topple over, now. You've probably been through a lot.",""
"55049764-9-5324","The energy subsides. But the animals are still savage monsters. We'll have to try something else.nnWe need a bear.",""
"55049764-9-5344","Something's wrong. More than just the illness. I just think. Something's not right here.",""
"55049764-9-5423","Fair day. I'm Astanya, watch captain. With the Queen in town we have extra security precautions to see to. Where are you traveling from?",""
"55049764-9-5447","Ah, my friend. This one was just thinking about you.nnNothing personal, of course. Raz threat-assesses all of his assets.",""
"55049764-9-5448","I'm sorry, citizen. I have to focus on my upcoming speech. Fair day.",""
"55049764-9-5548","Follow the moons, my friend.",""
"55049764-9-5608","Thus ends the story of the most sacred sites here in <<1>>.",""
"55049764-9-5625","Good luck out there.",""
"55049764-9-5629","I can't believe you found me out here! Did you come from the Hollow City?nnCould you help me, please?",""
"55049764-9-5631","I wish I had tried to do something sooner. Maybe then Gamirth would still be with me.",""
"55049764-9-5633","Quickly, now! We must not let Lyris's sacrifice be in vain!",""
"55049764-9-5713","I'm not looking forward to finding my way to this city, but I'm at least thankful that I'm not in that battle anymore.",""
"55049764-9-5714","At first, Mim was excited to be free.nnBut then he saw who was standing next to him. You couldn't just leave him, no?",""
"55049764-9-5735","This realm is cruel, my friend.nnThough you may have saved us here, things may not always work out as well. You must be willing to lose those you care about if you hope to win. That's the only way we'll beat Molag Bal.",""
"55049764-9-5741","You have completed our trials, outsider. Now we ask you to settle our long debate.nnWill you side with the scholars or with the warriors?",""
"55049764-9-5786","The Prowler, here in <<1>>? They sail with the Gold Fleet!nnThey picked a poor time to visit this fair city.",""
"55049764-9-5790","I don't hear the sounds of battle. Are the bandits driven off?",""
"55049764-9-5795","Where is <<1>>? Was it her?",""
"55049764-9-5796","I get it. My people killed one of your own. They aren't evil, though.nnYou have to understand. We signed a pact to protect this forest. The Shadow Walkers believe that if they fail to honor that agreement, we're all doomed.",""
"55049764-9-5817","I've captured one of the books. It mentions this ruin specifically. All very exciting!",""
"55049764-9-5851","Bring me whatever you find in Vahtacen. If it's interesting, I'll buy it from you.",""
"55049764-9-5856","Quickly, comrade. Check the body.",""
"55049764-9-5859","I just wish we had another of those monsters so I could watch you do it again. nnYou would do it again, wouldn't you? For me?",""
"55049764-9-5892","Send any survivng crew my way. I'll see if I can find more help, but you may be all we've got.",""
"55049764-9-5893","You still have the note. It needs to be delivered!",""
"55049764-9-5895","As I expected. Another resting place for the dead.nnSheogorath has a sick sense of humor.",""
"55049764-9-5898","Watch your back in here. The Goblins are well-armed for their breed.",""
"55049764-9-5900","I'll be honest, dearie. Those tricks are funnier than the ones we've seen the last few years. But for your entrance into the Boast? We can do better.",""
"55049764-9-5908","I'd say ""at your leisure,"" mortal. But I expect I have more time ahead of me than you do.",""
"55049764-9-5911","Just so you know, after this Khali will drink that brandy—whether or not you are still alive. So, stay alive.",""
"55049764-9-5920","Everyone dead and an ancient relic destroyed. I see Khali has been here.",""
"55049764-9-5953","So you're the one that everyone's talking about? I expected you to be bigger or something.",""
"55049764-9-5982","I almost lost faith there. I don't know why I doubted Azura, why I doubted you. nnMaybe it's from being so close to the king. He's consumed by terror in his dream.",""
"55049764-9-6065","All right, you know what's what. Now stop jawing at me and get rid of those rats!",""
"55049764-9-6066","This one prepares herself to crack the ward. A moment, Hallowed, and she shall be ready.",""
"55049764-9-6068","With the beacons cleansed, this ward is just an annoyance. Shazah is preparing to crack it wide open.",""
"55049764-9-6069","We're going down the skeever hole, recruit. Up for the challenge?",""
"55049764-9-6099","Go! Mathal is … damn it. He's so stupid. But he is all Kalari has. Parents dead, uncle Enak-do dead. Ezzag old and angry. nnDo not let Kalari's brother do something so stupid.",""
"55049764-9-6123","<<1>> really is sweet, you shall see. Tell him Shuzura said ""Bright Moons.""",""
"55049764-9-6126","So, Jone and Jode have chosen you to solve Ezzag's problem. Which problem are you here to solve?",""
"55049764-9-6207","I fear these Timberscar Goblins will be a problem for a long time to come.",""
"55049764-9-6220","We should hurry. From what I understand, the Mane's party has been cut off for several hours. nnWe've already got an undead Altmer prince to deal with; we certainly don't need an undead Mane as well!",""
"55049764-9-6233","Alliances—bah. We have no need for any of them. Death and destruction is all they bring.",""
"55049764-9-6269","You'll find Aluri along the north road. She'll know where the Dremora are.",""
"55049764-9-6292","Come, my friend. Let's return to the temple.",""
"55049764-9-6335","Don't worry. Raz has suffered worse.",""
"55049764-9-6337","The best route to the sanctuary is through Serpent's Grotto to the northeast. nnGo quickly, if you can. The more time we give the Maormer, the more difficult it will be to drive them back.",""
"55049764-9-6339","I hope you can assist <<1>>.",""
"55049764-9-6364","You got past the front door. Impressive. Perhaps you're my way off this damned isle.",""
"55049764-9-6382","We need every warrior if Bruma is to be saved. Find Methas and Halfara, please.",""
"55049764-9-6409","They took Bowenas! My wife is gone!",""
"55049764-9-6422","Be wary in there. Nereids wield dangerous magic and can never be trusted. It's no surprise they helped the villagers in their suicidal plot.nnIn fact, the Nereids probably consider General Malgoth's bow a prize. They will defend his remains.",""
"55049764-9-6440","Have a look around. I'll keep watch.",""
"55049764-9-6441","I'll watch your back, see if we can find anything useful. If we're lucky, something stupid will try to jump you.",""
"55049764-9-6444","Our warriors have prised the Elder Scroll of Ni-Mohk from the clutches of our enemies. We are one step closer to victory!",""
"55049764-9-6448","Ezreba is just waiting for her friend.",""
"55049764-9-6456","You have completed the Trial of Spirit. Are you ready to undertake the Trial of Body now?",""
"55049764-9-6457","How did it go? Are my companions safe?",""
"55049764-9-6478","Once my caches are full, I might spend some time on the road, see what kind of trouble I can get into.",""
"55049764-9-6485","The crew of that beached ship may be on edge. Let them know you're with the Dominion.",""
"55049764-9-6506","I wish I could put Juras to rest myself, but I'd never survive the trip, let alone the undead that infest that ruin.",""
"55049764-9-6509","When we entered the temple, that skeleton made it sound as though <<1>> was in grave danger.nnI won't let vague threats keep us from my master, but <<1>> is too important to lose. Perhaps we should think before we act.",""
"55049764-9-6514","What luck! The Prowler was untouched by the hurricane. Then, as we sailed past these shoals, a storm came out of nowhere and beached us!nnWait, what are you doing here?",""
"55049764-9-6515","I can feel my strength fade faster now.",""
"55049764-9-6590","Keep your wits about you, my new friend. Mistral's houses cast deep shadows, and vipers lurk in the tall grass.",""
"55049764-9-6591","The vile and ruthless Wood Elves smash our eggs just because they feel threatened by our numbers.nnThey even hold some in their dwellings, using them as hostages against us. This is not a way to live. We must get our eggs back.",""
"55049764-9-6593","They don't even know what they're really doing here. Idiots. I can't wait to see how they react to Gavo's little speech.",""
"55049764-9-6594","Just point the crystal in his direction. Cariel and I will do the rest.",""
"55049764-9-6599","Not again. Please, I understand what <<c:1>> desires, but I already told you. We cannot provide him with our copy of the treaty.",""
"55049764-9-6614","May the light of Jone and Jode bring you luck in the Division Arenas, my friend.",""
"55049764-9-6618","You there, please. I need your assistance.",""
"55049764-9-6629","I fetched my father's instructions and marked on your map where he believes we might find these things.nnPlease—he is very weak—we must move quickly. You lead the way and I will follow.",""
"55049764-9-6635","I have nothing more to say to you.",""
"55049764-9-6667","Behind you are the luxury guest lodgings. Covenant and Pact agents, thick as thieves.nnThe troops here aren't even bothering to hide their colors. Sloppy.",""
"55049764-9-6705","Bakkhara welcomes your strength.",""
"55049764-9-6734","I haven't seen you around the island before. In the name of the Thalmor, what's your business here?",""
"55049764-9-6756","You can't seriously be considering her proposal, can you? She's a confounded vampire, for Magnus's sake!",""
"55049764-9-6757","Go, Hallowed. You know what must be done. Protect the souls of the Khajiit in all that you do.",""
"55049764-9-6761","You appear to have arrived in the Wretched Squalor, a shanty town of soul shriven outside Mannimarco's castle.",""
"55049764-9-6789","Hallowed, without your wisdom I don't know if I could stand to be here. Thank you.",""
"55049764-9-6790","Hallowed, you are my strength today. I couldn't do this without you.",""
"55049764-9-6791","This won't be easy. Is there anything else you want to ask me before we move out?",""
"55049764-9-6794","It looks like the injured Wood Elf has something he wants to say to you.",""
"55049764-9-6806","The queen will want to hear about Vicereeve Pelidil's actions. I'll prepare a letter for the next courier.",""
"55049764-9-6831","You're the only one left to challenge Selene.",""
"55049764-9-6919","You don't want to keep the moon-sugar-induced visions waiting, do you?",""
"55049764-9-6931","There is one more part to the path. Are you ready to continue?",""
"55049764-9-6978","Go on and start without me. I must catch up with this beautiful woman! We have so much to discuss.nnI'll meet you at the manor house after you've had a good soak.",""
"55049764-9-6981","Pour the <<1>> into the basin and prepare yourself. The truth of this place can be disturbing. nnAnd be careful. Once the illusion breaks, you will be in danger.",""
"55049764-9-7009","Ahh, the Moon Hallowed. Welcome to the Temple of the Two Moons Dance.  The Champions are here, and await only your arrival. Are you ready to join them within?",""
"55049764-9-7015","The Mages Guild stands ready to do our part for this effort. I just wish I had as much confidence as Vanus Galerion. We're facing some overwhelming odds here, you know.",""
"55049764-9-7043","Hopefully this will work.",""
"55049764-9-7046","I'm relieved this tribe can call <<1>> their home. If the Dominion can't honor the promises of its members, what good is it?",""
"55049764-9-7058","<This Argonian matches the description of <<1>>, one of the tribe's leaders. He appears to be sleeping.>",""
"55049764-9-7068","I rescued her from them. The mercenaries killed her mother, and the other chicks in her brood. This creature had done no wrong, yet they would kill her to be paid for her feathers!nnI couldn't stand by and let that happen. Could you?",""
"55049764-9-7070","Did you hear that? It's like the wizard spoke directly to my mind. What's a ""sijick projection?""nnI don't know what any of that means, but it sounds like we should find a way out.",""
"55049764-9-7071","Did you hear <<1>>'s message? We should locate his Psijic projection as quickly as we can.",""
"55049764-9-7108","You proved very useful and earned the assistance I provided you.nnBut I wouldn't recommend lingering in my territory, little mortal. I cannot vouch for the patience or control of my newly awakened kyn.",""
"55049764-9-7118","I'll let you talk with the spinner. I tend to infuriate her. No idea why.",""
"55049764-9-7158","Speak with Gilraen if you have something to say, stranger. I've got wounded to rip from death's jaws.",""
"55049764-9-7159","I'm a bit busy—speak to Gilraen if you must.nnThough why you aren't running from here, screaming, I don't know. Haven't you heard there are Daedric cultists attacking?",""
"55049764-9-7161","I heard <<1>>'s message. If we find his Psijic projection, we can stop the ritual.",""
"55049764-9-7194","Welcome to the island of Stirk. Representatives from all three alliances are gathering at the meeting place. It's just up ahead, through the ruins.",""
"55049764-9-7214","They're waiting on you. Good luck. You're going to need it.",""
"55049764-9-7228","You've done well. Your reward is near. Now that you've experienced the battles of the past, it's time you met with the leaders of the Redguard people.nnYou have one more challenge to face.",""
"55049764-9-7423","You know, Tharn's not such a bad chap, once you get beyond the sour expression and the condescending attitude. And the sarcasm, of course. That's rather a bother.nnCome to think, he is a bit of a twit, isn't he?",""
"55049764-9-7430","Come, my friend. Let's return to the temple.",""
"55049764-9-7451","Who are you? What do you seek?",""
"55049764-9-7476","At last, the Elder Scroll of Ni-Mohk is ours. All honor to the brave warriors who won this relic for the Pact!",""
"55049764-9-7478","Do you smell the scent of burning embers in the air?  We may be in for a treat if Kasura is teaching the firewalk!",""
"55049764-9-7503","You have your orders, soldier. Capture the Elder Scroll of Mnem for the Covenant!",""
"55049764-9-7508","When I get my hands on Mannimarco, I'm going to slice that traitor stem to sternum and wash my hands in his body cavity!",""
"55049764-9-7511","The shield is gone. Kill the doppelganger and grab Sahan before they take him again!",""
"55049764-9-7515","I'm sorry, I'm not interested in talking with anyone at the moment.",""
"55049764-9-7560","What did I tell you? That tear sent us right into a parallel version of our world where the way through the ruins is free and clear.nnJust keep that runestone handy. I'm sure we'll need it again. Now lead on. I'll be right behind you.",""
"55049764-9-7609","We will win this for my sister, for the shield of Tamrith! For Captain Janeve!nnMay the Light shine on us all!",""
"55049764-9-7613","My house isn't far from here. We'll slip into my basement laboratory, grab the scroll, and use it to unlock the cathedral.",""
"55049764-9-7622","We are almost at the Inner Courtyard. Make haste!",""
"55049764-9-7623","I can't shake the feeling that we're being watched.",""
"55049764-9-7625","Sebazi greets you, warrior. An army camp is an exciting place, no? Sebazi wonders, of every face she sees, if that face will ever return.",""
"55049764-9-7626","Soon I too will return to war. Perhaps someday we will fight side-by-side.",""
"55049764-9-7627","Mercenaries, huh. I don't trust warriors who fight for anything other than the thrill of battle.",""
"55049764-9-7646","Let's make haste. There's no telling what the Architect will do to us when he finds out we're free.nnIt's a great thing you've done for us, my friend. I didn't think Saryne and I would ever walk free.",""
"55049764-9-7697","<<1>> can't have been interested in ancient dinner invitations.nnNo, there must be more to this. We should find another Welkynd stone and see what we can learn.",""
"55049764-9-7699","How splendid! Look, Stibbons, it's our friend … the one from Glenumbra! What good fortune. I was just saying to Stibbons, ""Stibbons, I do wish someone would come along who has proven their worth!"" And then you turned up, in answer to my summons!",""
"55049764-9-7701","So Uela's hiding away in the island tower? Let's go scout it out.",""
"55049764-9-7719","My prison holds me in complete solitude for centuries, yet two visitors arrive on the same day.nnBut we have little time. <<1>> has pushed deeper into the prison.",""
"55049764-9-7732","It is not safe for you here. Go quickly, and walk in the light.",""
"55049764-9-7748","Shall we keep moving, or did you wish to continue prattling on endlessly?",""
"55049764-9-7765","After a few more drinks, I think I'm headed back to my tent. I think I'll take a nap … a very long nap.",""
"55049764-9-7791","Hello again, traveler. Watch your pockets—things have a way of disappearing from them in Redfur.",""
"55049764-9-7794","I plan to lead House Tamrith with the same committment and devotion as my father. We will not see Rivenspire under another despot's thrall.nnThat's why I sent my sister Janeve and her troops west. The people of Rivenspire must be protected.",""

"55049764-9-7805","I have much to learn in your shadow, my friend. You have done more for the Hollow Moon than most could ever claim.",""
"55049764-9-7809","Why are you still here? I need to concentrate if I'm going to learn anything important here. And you need to go talk to High King Emeric.",""
"55049764-9-7811","This is a bit more than I expected. Did I say we would hold this ground come Oblivion or Coldharbour? I didn't mean that in a literal sense.nnIf you told me you thought we should retreat … well, I might consider such counsel.",""
"55049764-9-7858","Adusa was just thinking of you! Did the courier reveal anything important?",""
"55049764-9-7930","I have nothing to say to you.",""
"55049764-9-7937","As much as I hate to admit it, Tiria is right. Nyronie's willing sacrifice is priceless compared to yours. nnI raised her, you know? We found her, abandoned, a lost child that the wood kept safe until we discovered her.",""
"55049764-9-7938","Impressive for an outsider.",""
"55049764-9-7941","You're rather useful, in your own way. Meritorious work!nnNow according to my notes, I just need to combine these reagents, and shake the vial ….",""
"55049764-9-7997","Brelor and Nairume delivered Rajhin's Mantle to Elden Root. Now we must recover an Ayleid source of power and a skilled operator.",""
"55049764-9-8005","I know you have the strength to see this through.",""
"55049764-9-8006","Please believe me. I can't be certain the talisman will work, but you must act quickly!",""
"55049764-9-8014","I can feel my strength fade faster now.",""
"55049764-9-8069","Please speak to my attendant. From now on, you will need to go through him. Do you understand? From now on, I do not wish to be seen with you.",""
"55049764-9-8088","We need to find a suitable place to swear an oath to Malacath. We'll see how Osgrikh handles an oath on his head.",""
"55049764-9-8272","Well! Isn't this delightful! nnWorld saved, heroes gone their separate ways, and this knight has a new mistress to serve. Bravo! Couldn't be happier! Smashing! Truly!",""
"55049764-9-8310","Travel cautiously. There is trouble in the air, and in the land.",""
"55049764-9-8311","Oh! Hello there. Sorry I didn't see you coming. I'm keeping my eye out for harpies. And a pair of puny Breton brothers.",""
"55049764-9-8318","I think I'm going to train up a few of the townspeople so next time bandits come into town, they'll be in for a rude surprise.",""
"55049764-9-8330","You really have the knack for this. While I'm getting Martin released, I wonder … would you be at all open to taking a crack at another one of my stubborn prospects?nnHer name's Shuga. She's got a mouth on her, but she'd make a good soldier.",""
"55049764-9-8333","As I feared. The delay caused by my missing memories allowed Montclair to reach this place before us.nnThis veil … it has Lleraya's deft touch about it.",""
"55049764-9-8343","I will pray for poor Ellic. And for Alard, as well. Perhaps Arkay will grant them peace.",""
"55049764-9-8346","Why would the Baroness do this?",""
"55049764-9-8347","Thank you ever so much for getting us out of that terrible place.",""
"55049764-9-8455","Plague husks? Here? Where did they all come from?nnAre these really all the people that came here looking for help?",""
"55049764-9-8493","Glad to see you managed to make it out of the quarantine, too. Does that mean those Maulborn fetchers have been dealt with?",""
"55049764-9-8572","What's this? Another motley band come to steal my glory? You don't have the guts!",""
"55049764-9-8638","We must overcome the Argonian threat and help my sister before it's too late!",""
"55049764-9-8648","Those beasts had me up there for hours! Thank you for the assistance, stranger.nnListen—can I trouble you for more help? I promise you this forest isn't as tranquil as it appears.",""
"55049764-9-8656","Now you know what the Serpent has done to us. How he split us into pieces.nnHe intends to locate our weakened aspects and forge them into a being he can control—one poisoned by his corruption. You must find our aspects before the Serpent does.",""
"55049764-9-8657","The service in this tavern is frustratingly slow.",""
"55049764-9-8658","I was going to tell you all about it. I just needed to find the right time.",""
"55049764-9-8667","Here we are. I hope you're ready.",""
"55049764-9-8703","I saw you eyeing up the forge and anvil over there.",""
"55049764-9-8704","No, don't tell me what's up there. I'll find out all on my own.nnOnce Brulo gets here. If he survives the gutting I give him.",""
"55049764-9-8705","Just a moment.",""
"55049764-9-8707","What do you think? Ready to turn a plan into action?",""
"55049764-9-8721","Hop into the boat. I'll untie us and we can get on our way. I'll explain everything once we get there, not to worry.",""
"55049764-9-8738","Let's get the spellplates and get out of here. Gwen insists we steal them, and we need her to be happy.",""
"55049764-9-8739","Quick! Let's grab the spellplates and get out of here!",""
"55049764-9-8740","Let's steal those spellplates and get out of here!",""
"55049764-9-8742","This is one of mine. They've really wrecked the steamworks here, though.",""
"55049764-9-8808","Go see what Nic has to say.",""
"55049764-9-8809","Hope you're ready for this, Rook.",""

"55049764-9-8897","Head to the watchtower. Varn and I will meet you there.",""
"55049764-9-8898","We'll see you at the watchtower. Stay sharp.",""
"55049764-9-8925","I tried to be polite, but you see how far that got me. Let's meet up at the Valley of Scars. We'll probably need to go with our alternate plan again.",""
"55049764-9-8933","These scorpions were specifically selected for their compatibility with the mantikoras. With the matron slain and her nests destroyed, this portion of the process can't be duplicated.nnI wouldn't have been able to do this without your help.",""
"55049764-9-8947","You smell like lightning, and some of your hair's a bit smokey. But you look well enough, considering. Good work!",""
"55049764-9-8949","You can study my countenance as much as you like. Wouldn't you rather have a reward?",""
"55049764-9-8954","Bring some rough maple to a woodworking station and refine it into sanded maple. It's easy work.",""
"55049764-9-8966","Roast pig is an easy recipe to learn, but difficult to master.",""

"55049764-9-9039","What's this? You've made it past the Dwemer defenses as well?nnTell me, did you happen to see any living Orcs in the quarry outside?",""
"55049764-9-9070","The new chief must be worthy. Not a dimwitted ranch hand or a drunk with a blade.nnI want you to compete in the trials. You will be the touchstone—the true test of the worthiness of the would-be chiefs.",""
"55049764-9-9112","The relic is an Elder Scroll, trapped in the library of the White-Gold Tower. It's surrounded by minions of Molag Bal.nnThey can't get to it, luckily. Not yet. We'll need you to take us through the throne room to reach it.",""
"55049764-9-9128","THIS IS MY DEFAULT TEXT. nnDO DO DOO",""
"55049764-9-9267","Thank the Divines, you are safe! There is that, at least. nnLyris sacrificed everything, that we might go free. Her sacrifice must not be in vain.",""
"55049764-10-6","If you find some gems, take them right to Khalisah. She does great work and she's always been a really good friend. nnShe'll make something that will impress Guendeline, I just know it.",""
"55049764-10-479","I've heard you've sworn fealty to <<1>>. One wonders why you've come to me now.nnOur houses are not enemies, but I fear the time will come when such distinctions won't matter to Alard. He cares nothing for these people. He cares only for his pride.",""
"55049764-10-485","Disturbing news. Lord Montclair has taken citizens of Shornhelm captive in his ""mews."" I won't let whatever he plans to do with them come to pass.nnI need you to stop his plans. There must be no survivors.",""
"55049764-10-579","Heloise was such a kind soul. I can't believe they turned her into a monster!nnDamn the Montclairs! Damn them all to Oblivion!",""
"55049764-10-606","That woman! Her words are as sweet as honey but her heart is as bitter as spoiled wine.nnShe has a camp set up, right in the center tomb of the Barrows.",""

"55049764-10-623","Perhaps you would assist the Aldmeri Dominion once more?",""
"55049764-10-633","By the Divines, not another ….nnOh, excuse me. I thought you were someone else. What can I do for you?",""
"55049764-10-661","We are all very busy here, <<1>>. Stay out of the way, and perhaps some progress can be made against the Imperials.",""

"55049764-10-1058","Have you researched the rune? Did you note my technique in carving the surface? Or that the sandstone's grain runs counter to the faces of the garnet? Or that my initials are carved on the back?nnThat's not a spellcasting thing, I just like to do it.",""
"55049764-10-1757","I wish our Healer had enough poultice to spare for all our wounded inside, but this will have to do for now.",""
"55049764-10-1758","Though the rumors of battle may prove true, you have exposed a traitor in our midst. Thank you. <<1>> is rarely a bad judge of character.",""

"55049764-10-2185","Do not travel by land to the towers! It is out of the question. The Balac is too precious, and there are many dangers out in the world.nnSeek the Mages Guild I say, for they are allies still, and know much of the magics of teleportation.",""

"55049764-10-2560","My mother was wise to see the connection. nnThe creatures' hostility was influenced by the same anger holding sway over victims here.nnStill, I believe the urn will prove to be the true source of this curse.",""

"55049764-10-2733","Before you alert the king, speak to Vizier Bolura. She is a trusted friend, and she can tell you how best to approach the king with such news.nnTu'whacca's Throne is sacred and if necromancy is involved, this will disturb the king greatly.",""

"55049764-10-4457","We will continue our investigation into these anchors. We'll let you know when it's ready.",""
"55049764-10-4494","Who are you? I saw you using the puzzle stones … how did you unravel their secrets? You don't look like one of the Renrijra, but I warn you, you may be playing with things you can't possibly understand.",""
"55049764-10-4497","Curse it, why can't I pry this open?",""
"55049764-10-4503","Comrade! We have need of you. Will you fight by our side?",""
"55049764-10-4513","Are you well, comrade? Did it harm you?",""
"55049764-10-4563","Hmm, these runes were drawn in the eighth … no, the ninth house. Have to take that into account.",""
"55049764-10-4580","It will take time for the Companions to recover. But we will, as we always have.",""
"55049764-10-4631","We've got to get to Stral. End Stral, and we end the Reachmen's threat.",""
"55049764-10-4666","Have you spoken with any of the villagers?",""
"55049764-10-4677","We're here. The villagers are safe, for the moment, but the Covenant's still coming.nnWe've got to get word to Davon's Watch.",""

"55049764-10-4729","When you're finished, let me know what our Prince of Madness had to say.",""
"55049764-10-4743","That wonderful mortal's house is in the center of the forest. Just follow the path. You can't miss it!",""

"55049764-10-4778","Were you successful? Do you have the tome?",""
"55049764-10-4779","Were you successful? Do you have the tome?",""
"55049764-10-4799","You've been gone for a while. Tell me you found something useful.",""
"55049764-10-4859","Hello again. The old man wants a word.",""
"55049764-10-4860","You've saved me. Saved me from myself. And in some way, you've saved my daughter too. I feel her love again, like a balm upon my heart.nnThere's nothing in this world that could repay you in kind. I will pray for you for the rest of my days.",""
"55049764-10-4867","Rala will release Scales when the sun sets. We'll give her the potion and hope for the best.nnNow to more important matters. We must discuss my father's creations.",""
"55049764-10-4894","Well met. I thank you for the assistance, but this place is teeming with Daedra.nnYou should leave if you value your life.",""
"55049764-10-4904","I'm sure Nilara will know more. She isn't always popular, but she's a dedicated treethane.",""
"55049764-10-4913","<<1>>'s charms claim another fool. I don't know how she does it.nnWell, now that you're here we can get on to the next part of Sal's plan.",""
"55049764-10-4916","This started out as a nightmare, but now … everything's different. I never thought I'd get the chance to tell my father how I felt. It's like a weight has been lifted.nnWe should keep moving.",""
"55049764-10-4926","We must rescue the Silvenar. Free Ambassador Raen!",""

"55049764-10-5036","Get back my silk from Turil. Hopefully he puts up a fight and you have to murder him.nnYou know, I'd pay you extra if that happens.",""
"55049764-10-5037","The bandits could move their camp at any moment. Don't let them get away!",""
"55049764-10-5046","I'll never forgive myself if <<1>> comes to harm.",""
"55049764-10-5087","When you're finished, let me know what our Prince of Madness had to say.",""
"55049764-10-5096","You can find her in the hall in Wayrest, comrade. May the Eight protect you.",""
"55049764-10-5108","That was the first step. We still have much to do.",""
"55049764-10-5110","The stone on the pedestal holds something. An ancient evil. Be careful.",""
"55049764-10-5111","Valaste is working the problem out of the Marbruk Guildhall.  See you there, Adept.",""
"55049764-10-5128","Lieutenant Ehran's gone. Damn idealistic bastard … I tried to protect him, but he wouldn't let me.nnLook, we've got to do what he asked. We must free Velyn Harbor. But do something for me first. Kill the bastard that killed him.",""
"55049764-10-5135","You have the heart of a true trickster!",""
"55049764-10-5145","Lost Knife is west of Fort Amol in the Frostwater Tundra. It's a fair trip from here along the southwest border of Eastmarch.nnThe house will be obvious. This one will wait for you outside.",""
"55049764-10-5163","You're not dead. That makes you my new friend.",""
"55049764-10-5269","<<1>> is off limits. Please make your way back to the main road.",""
"55049764-10-5324","When that Daedric influence is gone, it should be safe to restore the village. My poor neighbors.",""
"55049764-10-5344","A town full of ill folk. Mercenaries patrol the streets, and my boy is in the quarantine cave. Good thing I don't believe in curses.",""
"55049764-10-5423","Fair day, visitor. I'm Astanya, watch captain. I'll need you to state your name for the record. nnExtra precautions with Queen Ayrenn in town. You understand.",""
"55049764-10-5447","You ready for a harder task, my friend? Ready for a mission worthy of the Queen's Eyes?",""
"55049764-10-5608","Thank you for hearing our stories. I look forward to hearing your own one day.",""
"55049764-10-5625","Well, this isn't good.",""
"55049764-10-5633","Thank the Divines, you are safe! There is that, at least. nnLyris sacrificed everything, that we might go free. Her sacrifice must not be in vain.",""

"55049764-10-5741","Speak to me again when you have completed An-Jeen-Sakka's trial.",""
"55049764-10-5790","The antidote will be ready soon. Then we can get everyone back on their feet.",""
"55049764-10-5795","Please see <<1>>, if you have questions. I don't know you, outsider.",""
"55049764-10-5796","Just think about it. Please.nnDon't kill any of the Shadow Walkers and I promise I'll go with you when you leave. You could use someone like me! And I want to make Molag Bal pay for what he's done to my people.",""
"55049764-10-5817","Ah, you've returned.",""
"55049764-10-5856","Be quick!",""
"55049764-10-5859","Could you do that again? nnBut with more blood. More.",""
"55049764-10-5892","If you're serious about stopping <<1>> and freeing my crew, I won't turn down your help.nnBut from everything we saw, <<Ac:2>> is a series of death traps. If the undead guarding the place hadn't surprised the mutineers, we'd never have escaped.",""
"55049764-10-5895","I should be able to join you in Hammerfell, as well. Here in Tamriel, Sheogorath has no power to contain me.",""
"55049764-10-5898","Good timing. You saved my neck, whether you meant to or not.",""
"55049764-10-5900","Dollie thinks it'd be funny to kill everybody. I don't think she understands the meaning of the word.",""
"55049764-10-5908","I was beginning to wonder if you'd ever show up. My lord seems to derive amusement from my annoyance.nnYou are here to retrieve a tome for that … Shalidor person, correct?",""
"55049764-10-5911","Damn this place. Another dark fire door.",""
"55049764-10-5920","Go, my new friend. We will be fine for now. Knowing Khali, she is hip-deep in bodies and her sword arm grows weak. Just the way she likes it.",""
"55049764-10-5953","You're standing a little close, don't you think?",""
"55049764-10-5982","King Emeric falling ill cannot be a coincidence. Vaermina is raising the stakes, making a final bid for power by assaulting the king himself. nnI am out of my league. I will go to the king's side, but we must seek Azura's help.",""
"55049764-10-6065","All right. Now, on to my problem. There are some rats in my well. I can hear them scraping around down there at the bottom.",""
"55049764-10-6066","Hallowed, this one is glad you are here. This beacon has an intensity to its corruption …. It is teeming with the energies of the Dro-m'Athra. nnShazah must perform the purification.",""
"55049764-10-6068","Better you than me, Hallowed. I've never been much for the spiritual.",""
"55049764-10-6099","Did you get any of those ghosts to talk? What did you find?",""
"55049764-10-6123","Shuzura is sure it will turn out to be nothing, but <<1>> must always get his way. Luck to you.",""
"55049764-10-6126","What do you want, stranger? You are in Ezzag's light. This one has chores to do.",""
"55049764-10-6220","This is not a good time. I have to focus right now.",""
"55049764-10-6292","This seems to be some horrible vision of the future, yes?",""
"55049764-10-6335","Razum-dar simply cannot believe a little weasel like Pelidil could come up with such a genius plan, but we will find a way to stop him.nnThis one will make his own way to Seaside Sanctuary. He will see you there.",""
"55049764-10-6337","Feel like I spend more time in the damn Thalmor Headquarters than I do outdoors these days. nnThey need to get their arses in order and secure the city or I'm going to ask the queen to send them packing.",""
"55049764-10-6339","Perhaps you can help my agents in the field. If you can find Vadeem-Kal or Silent-Moss, I'm certain they can use you. Look on the far side of the Dominion camps.",""
"55049764-10-6409","Thank you so much! Has anyone ever told you you're pretty great? Because you are.",""
"55049764-10-6422","What a sacrifice! To think the villagers actually poisoned themselves in order to poison the Blackroot Clan … it may be morbid, but it's also brilliant.nnOf course, that really doesn't help us return the Blackroot warriors to their graves, does it?",""
"55049764-10-6440","Cadwell's plan worked! We might actually pull this off!",""
"55049764-10-6441","Come on, let's send these Daedra-rutting pigs straight to their maker!",""
"55049764-10-6444","I await word on the Elder Scroll of Ni-Mohk. Surely our warriors will not fail in this challenge.",""
"55049764-10-6456","Have you made a decision, outsider?",""
"55049764-10-6457","Rescue my friends from the ogrims and then we'll deal with the Overseer.",""
"55049764-10-6485","Turns out my squad were the ones who found me. Ever consider a career as a Dominion marine? You'd make quite the scout.nnMy squad said you were looking for <<1>>. Have you found him?",""
"55049764-10-6509","That barrier must have activated when the dead began to rise.nnIt looks like the cycle of the two moons is important, somehow. Perhaps that's the key to disrupting the barrier!",""
"55049764-10-6591","You disappoint me outsider, choosing to side with murderers and thieves instead of us.nnMy people will no longer sit back and hope for peace. We will take our children back! You just watch and see!",""
"55049764-10-6593","I can't wait to hear this. This should be good.",""
"55049764-10-6594","Cari was right about you.",""
"55049764-10-6599","It's hard to keep track of the new faces since the hurricane, but I don't believe we've met.nnWelcome to <<1>>. May your stay here be full of warm winds and soft sand.",""
"55049764-10-6614","The crowds can't get enough of you, Mysterious Stranger!",""
"55049764-10-6629","Then come quickly. I left my father's instructions in my tent. I was gathering ingredients one-at-a-time, but together we can gather everything much faster.nnMeet me at my tent in the camp and we will go from there.",""
"55049764-10-6667","My friend, I could not be happier to see you again. A veteran Eye is just who I need by my side today.",""
"55049764-10-6734","Do you work here? Are you a field hand?",""
"55049764-10-6756","We can't trust this one. Her pleasing form hides a hideous and powerful monster.",""
"55049764-10-6757","You must not linger here, Moon Hallowed. Now that you know your place in the world, you must go to Fort Grimwatch. You must stand against the darkness with the Lunar Champions.",""
"55049764-10-6791","Could you progress any slower through this installation full of deadly Daedras?",""
"55049764-10-6794","Hm. You killed Andur? That's not supposed to happen.",""
"55049764-10-6806","These are uncertain times. Without our queen to guide us, we would be lost. I pray our enemies don't get their way.",""
"55049764-10-6831","Be mindful of your step. This forest has been most unkind to guests.",""
"55049764-10-6978","Enjoy your bath. We'll meet you at the manor when you're finished here.",""
"55049764-10-6981","Keep your wits about you. Things are not as they appear.",""
"55049764-10-7009","Ahh, this one can see the light of the moons reflected in your eyes. The Moon Hallowed walks among us.",""
"55049764-10-7015","How many did we lose today? I … I can't even count.nnI fear going back home. Seeing who survived and who didn't. It's all just so … overwhelming ….",""
"55049764-10-7043","The Welkynd stones are the only way to break the barrier and enter the heart.",""
"55049764-10-7046","Are you here about the refugees? I've already explained this to three inspectors from Elden Root. Until their status is resolved, the Argonians are to remain within the enclosure.",""
"55049764-10-7058","The meeting! I nearly slept through it. <<1>> wants to discuss the grumbling about the barricades.nnYou should come, see how we govern ourselves.",""
"55049764-10-7068","You're quite light on your feet. Let me see the eggs.",""
"55049764-10-7070","So we stop the ritual or die trying? All right.nnAn honor to fight beside you. You'd make an outstanding marine.",""
"55049764-10-7071","After trapping <<1>> in his crypt, this ""<<2>>"" will be no trouble at all.",""
"55049764-10-7108","Don't mind me, little mortal. It's just that I find you so … fascinating!",""
"55049764-10-7118","When <<1>> sees me, she'll be surprised! Hopefully not enough to scatter me across <<Ac:2>>. Again.nnIt'll be fine!",""
"55049764-10-7158","Speak with Gilraen if you have something to say, stranger. I've got wounded to rip from death's jaws.",""
"55049764-10-7159","Gilraen's our leader. She speaks for us.",""
"55049764-10-7161","We should stop the Sea Viper ritual before they destroy all life on <<1>>. It never gets easier, does it?",""
"55049764-10-7194","Everything's been prepared. Are you ready to travel to the summit?",""
"55049764-10-7214","Well met. The Fighters Guild will handle security for the summit on Stirk. As a neutral party, we were the logical choice.",""
"55049764-10-7423","I say, you do get into some wild adventures, don't you?nnThis place is so odd. Did you know that the fire here is actually warm? Brilliant!",""
"55049764-10-7430","This is some horror. A vision of the future, right?",""
"55049764-10-7451","Know that this is <<1>>'s forest and we are his Briars. If you want to join us, you'll need to pay your respects.",""
"55049764-10-7476","The Elder Scroll of Ni-Mohk still rests in enemy hands. How can this be?",""
"55049764-10-7478","We should get to the abbey. Kasura and I have much to discuss.",""
"55049764-10-7503","The Elder Scroll of Ghartok is ours at last. The eyes of Akatosh shine on the Covenant!",""
"55049764-10-7508","First a doppelganger of Tharn, then one of me? What are these horkers playing at? nnIt's a wonder Sai hasn't lost his mind, completely. Let's keep moving and hope he still has a soul to save.",""
"55049764-10-7511","Well, well, well. Wasn't that a charming little scene? I can't wait to mock … to tell Titanborn all about it.",""
"55049764-10-7560","Just hold the runestone up to the tear. Let's see what happens!",""
"55049764-10-7609","I had to see this with my own eyes. These refugees tell a savage tale.",""
"55049764-10-7613","Bears leave rather distinctive tracks, don't they? I can't imagine they'd be hard to spot.",""
"55049764-10-7622","Onward to the Dragonguard Tomb. The first shrine is there, and we must consecrate both before the vault door can be opened.",""
"55049764-10-7623","I've heard stories of this place, but I've never had the opportunity to come here. I trust Sai had good reasons for placing the amulet in a place such as this.",""
"55049764-10-7646","All that remains is to deal with the Mad Architect himself. nnHe waits deep below us, heavily defended and well-armed. But I'm a betting man and I think you can beat him. You're our only chance.",""
"55049764-10-7697","<<1>>'s soldiers spoke of Welkynd stones in the area. If you can get me there safely, perhaps we'll learn how they relate to <<2>>.",""
"55049764-10-7699","Ah, wonderful! You're just in time.nnI'm in urgent need of assistance. In fact, I just said to my man Stibbons, ""Stibbons, we are in urgent need of assistance."" And here you are!",""
"55049764-10-7701","I don't think Uela's going to see this coming. Once the crows tell us how to find her, we'll soon be gnawing on her rotten little bones.",""
"55049764-10-7719","Swear you will free me, and I will allow you entry to my prison. I would speak to you with my true face.",""
"55049764-10-7748","The Dragonguard? As I recall, their primary purpose was to enforce the delusions of whomever sat upon the Ruby Throne in any given week.",""
"55049764-10-7765","Conniving cat, bargaining for those bows! I hope I don't come to regret this!",""
"55049764-10-7791","Jode's Chariot keeps <<1>> safe for trade. Keep your nose clean, or end up in the stocks.",""
"55049764-10-7802","While I am glad the Thalmor have not intervened, Jode's Chariot has been insufferable of late! We will need to adapt—and soon—if we are to keep up!",""
"55049764-10-7809","With the portal closed, we've stopped Reezal-Jul from sneaking more Montclair troops into the city. nnIt's frustrating, though, that Reezal-Jul slipped away. That Argonian is sly and cowardly.",""
"55049764-10-7811","There you are. If you expected to find us scaling the walls already, I'm sorry to disappoint.nnDon't get me wrong—we considered taking a stab at it, but with our … limited numbers, I don't really think that plays to our strengths.",""
"55049764-10-7858","Oh, don't look so shocked. Haven't you ever seen anyone enjoying a meal before?nnDo not give Adusa such a look! We are not all Montclairs, you know.",""
"55049764-10-7930","I am busy with matters of state. Go trouble someone else.",""
"55049764-10-7937","The wards are back, and the bears are no longer hostile to us.",""
"55049764-10-7938","Your journey is dangerous. Be wary of the guardians. They guard the temple fiercly with their lives.nnI take comfort in knowing their death is for a good cause.",""
"55049764-10-7941","Stendarr smite them, the Goblins took my reagents! It would serve them right if they ate them, the wretches!nnHmm, that gives me an idea.",""
"55049764-10-7997","Laranalda sent word. The Heart of Anumaril shall be held by the Elden Root Mages Guild until we require it. Now we must find a divine spark and an Ayleid source of power.",""
"55049764-10-8005","Now—we have some grim business to discuss. I pray that you will have the strength of will to see this through.",""
"55049764-10-8006","Oh, stranger … what have you done?",""
"55049764-10-8088","Swearing that oath was never going to bring Esmaeel back, but I hope he's comforted in knowing I've avenged his honor.nnHe never quite understood the fiercer side of my Orc tendencies. What those fiends did to him—I pray he rests in peace.",""
"55049764-10-8272","Good to see you again, old chum! Truly!",""
"55049764-10-8318","We can't let that maggot-eating bastard Gavendien get away with this!nnOld Sagabar wasn't so tough after he got into the stocks. He told me where Gavendien went, where their camp is.",""
"55049764-10-8330","What will I do now? Without the Shornhelm Guard I'm nothing. I told the general. I'm a soldier, not a recruiter. But now I'm to be discharged if I fail? It's not right.nnI've tried to do my duty, but I can't force people to enlist.",""
"55049764-10-8333","You found a key? Very good. Enter the ruins and I'll follow right behind you.",""
"55049764-10-8343","The Baron can be a harsh man, but I always thought him to be fair and even-handed. To throw his own son in the dungeon for crimes he doesn't remember—that may be extreme, even for Alard.",""
"55049764-10-8346","Gods! It's like something out of a story!",""
"55049764-10-8347","It's been horrible. Thank goodness help arrived.",""
"55049764-10-8455","That key should open the old gate and let us into the quarantine. Let's go see what the Maulborn are hiding in there.",""
"55049764-10-8493","My brother is gone. And I fear that my uncle doesn't have much longer. This plague … it's taken so many good people.",""

"55049764-11-1058","The recipe is over there. On the same table that you took the rune from. nnReally, novice, is this part hard for you? If it is, the parts where we fundamentally shift the natural order in order to enhance our magical powers might be tough.",""
"55049764-11-1757","The leader must be hiding in Aldsotha somewhere. My guess would be in the tavern. Since the Temple and Council Hall haven't fallen yet, it's the only place large enough they'd want to occupy.",""

"55049764-11-2280","I need heartwood. From inside the lurchers. It's the only thing that will help the little spriggan at this point.nnI hesitate to ask more of an outsider, but we could do more than just ease her passing.",""
"55049764-11-2299","After you've ensured the city is safe, meet me in the castle, and we'll deal with Duke Renchant. The poor fool probably doesn't even realize he's committed treason.nnMay the gods keep you, my courageous friend.",""

"55049764-11-2704","Whatever drew the beetles here is making them aggressive too. If one of them gets near you, I'd say kill it before it kills you.nnI hope Jahi finds some way to get rid of them before Sentinel runs out of water.",""

"55049764-11-4580","One thing always leads to another, and change can often be difficult to accept. However, we must continue. It's the only way.",""
"55049764-11-4631","It worked. Good.nnNow, speak to this memory of Stral. We'll spy the conversation he had with the cultist whose memory you stole.",""
"55049764-11-4688","That man … that Sheogorath. Can you … can you hear him? He's whispering in my head, I hear his voice. Why is his voice in my head?",""

"55049764-11-4745","I know it's silly, but that axe was my father's. It's been in our family as far back as anyone can remember. It has a certain … sentimental value.",""

"55049764-11-4860","What next? I don't know. I'll see to the dead, Bosmer and Drublog. It is all I can do. Simply … continue on.nnPerhaps Z'en will show me a new path while I pay penance. Perhaps I will find my own.",""
"55049764-11-4867","I promise we'll look after Scales. We'll make sure that she's safe and that she doesn't hurt anyone.nnNow I need your help. You saw for yourself. Vampire abominations prowl the springs. Those are my father's toys—sick creations of his evil mind.",""
"55049764-11-4904","I don't like this. I haven't been gone long, but the Green Hunters have set up a full-scale camp across the creek. Nilara says they've taken people from the village. And they're not doing anything about the werewolves.",""

"55049764-11-5135","I'd prepared myself for death. I'm glad it was unnecessary.",""
"55049764-11-5145","What have you found?",""
"55049764-11-5163","Bit busy here. Please, can you ask the others for help? They're just up at the camp.",""

"55049764-11-5859","That fight made me quite excited.",""

"55049764-11-5982","Praise Azura! I was losing faith. You were right about General Godrun. The Omen of Betrayal has the general in its grips. He was going to betray Emeric and attack Wayrest! nnThis was Vaermina's ultimate plan—to destroy the Daggerfall Covenant.",""

"55049764-11-6757","You must not linger here, Moon Hallowed. Now that you know your place in the world, you must go to the people of Arenthia. The sons and daughters of Jone and Jode call for your aid.",""

"55049764-11-7748","Where is this shrine? Let's find it and be done with this place.",""
"55049764-11-7765","You don't need two eyes to see how ugly things have gotten around here!",""
"55049764-11-7802","Hm?",""

"55049764-12-6794","Ah, here it comes. The big moment. The bang finish. In real life, this is when the Veiled Heritance acquired its newest recruit.nnBut in real life, Aranias was alone. In this story, she's not.",""
"55049764-12-6978","I could really use a good soak. Let's go over to the pools and wash up.",""
"55049764-12-6981","Be careful. Your eyes will play tricks on you in this place and you'll need to pay attention to save Stibbons.",""

"55049764-12-7748","One more shrine to consecrate, yes? Can we please get to it?",""
"55049764-12-7809","I can feel the magic. There's a portal close by. We need to close it before we're overrun by more Montclair soldiers.",""

"55049764-13-6629","You approach the camp of the Ash'abah. nnUnless you are here to help us, I suggest you turn around and go the other way.",""
"55049764-13-6667","You are a sight for sore eyes. I need your help.",""
"55049764-13-6756","Thanks to you, the vampires are no longer controlled by Molag Bal. I hope we don't live to regret this outcome.",""
"55049764-13-6757","Ahh, it is you. You drove the Colovians out of Arenthia, and freed Akkhuz-ri from the grip of the Dark Mane! This one feels the cool light of the moons flowing from your aura.",""
"55049764-13-6794","Watch Aranias' demonstration.",""
"55049764-13-6978","I can't believe how many strange woman have tried to capture me since I got here.nnThanks for helping me, by the way.",""
"55049764-13-6981","Thanks to you, and I can return to the service of Meridia. And I'm grateful you were able to save Stibbons. He's an … interesting fellow.nnI'm in your debt.",""
"55049764-13-7009","You're the one we've been studying! I need to speak to you.",""
"55049764-13-7043","Hold on, this will just be a moment.",""
"55049764-13-7118","Come on, we need to get to the Barrowbough!",""
"55049764-13-7194","That went well, I think. Shall we move on?",""
"55049764-13-7430","Have you ever seen a place like this, Hallowed? Even in my dreams, I never imagined it would look like this ….",""
"55049764-13-7476","You near the end of your training, soldier. Now to tell you of capturing the enemy's keeps and resources.",""
"55049764-13-7478","I'm grateful for your rescue. Time twisted in ways beyond my comprehension and it felt as though my torments would never end.",""
"55049764-13-7503","Capturing the Elder Scroll of Chim should be every Covenant soldier's top priority!",""
"55049764-13-7508","Help me with his bonds!",""
"55049764-13-7511","Sahan seems to been left in a rather awkward position. A bit rude of us to chat while he writhes in pain, don't you think?",""
"55049764-13-7613","Did <<1>> send you to mock me? Did you come to tell me I don't know the work of a Daedric Prince when I see one?",""
"55049764-13-7622","The shrine is on the other side of the chasm. We must find a way across.",""
"55049764-13-7623","Don't look at me. I'm terrible at puzzles!",""
"55049764-13-7697","Frost trolls. Why did they have to go and stir up frost trolls?",""
"55049764-13-7701","Let us keep moving. The longer we delay, the more difficult this will become.",""
"55049764-13-7748","A lever puzzle? How utterly pointless.",""
"55049764-13-7809","I assume you have come to rescue the nobles and stop Montclair's reinforcements. But if Reezal-Jul is here, you shouldn't have to face him alone.",""
"55049764-13-7858","House Montclair's hold on Shornhelm has been broken, but our job isn't done yet.",""
"55049764-13-7941","Please, pay me no mind. I didn't expect to react so strongly to seeing poor Stibbons in this state.nnNow, where did he put those notes?",""
"55049764-13-7997","Did you know your entire future is mapped out in the stars? One must only know how to read them.nnNot such an enviable skill, though. A mystery that kills the mystery, if you catch my meaning.",""
"55049764-13-8005","Damn these spiders ….",""
"55049764-13-8333","I expect that Baron Dorell and his troops will have found a good vantage point outside the city.nnWhile you help them liberate Northpoint, I'll continue to study the Ayleid book we discovered.",""
"55049764-13-8346","I had hoped <<1>> was mad, but if the Baroness knew ….nnCome on. Let's keep moving.",""
"55049764-13-8455","What happened to poor Grell? Is this what the plague does to people? How horrible!",""
"55049764-13-8658","You did a good joday, rook. Our crew is finally complete. And now we can move on to the next part of our plan.",""
"55049764-13-8667","Did you find anything?",""
"55049764-13-8705","Glad to see you've made it.",""
"55049764-13-8707","What do you think, you up to the challenge of taking on Magistrate Banu?",""
"55049764-13-8742","Hello, it's you. Need something?",""
"55049764-13-8808","Good luck out there, Rook. See you on the other side.",""
"55049764-13-8809","All right, Rook. Time to pick your poison.",""
"55049764-13-8810","I can't shake a strange feeling of this place.",""
"55049764-13-8811","Vexa is going to miss out.",""
"55049764-13-8830","Ready for another contract? You've done your trials and a job for the Keeper. Now, I've finally secured one from the Listener. He's interested in you.nnVarn and I will be accompanying for observation, but this should be the last time.",""
"55049764-13-8925","I wonder, since we're basically best friends now, could you do a favor for me?",""
"55049764-13-8933","Your help in this task was invaluable. Would you be willing to help me deal another defeat to the Serpent's schemes?",""
"55049764-13-8947","I had no doubts we'd speak again today. I just thought you'd have a few disfiguring burn marks. Well fought!",""
"55049764-13-8949","You've avoided the fangs of death for another day. Rilis is dead, then?",""
"55049764-13-8954","You're more than capable with needle and thread. I'll be proud to call you my colleague.",""
"55049764-13-8966","Glyphs are powerful things. They transform potential into certainty.nnAlso, you can sell them for coin. I once bought a fine pony with my proceeds. And before you ask, it was delicious.",""
"55049764-14-6","The more I think about this poetry idea, the more I like it. It's the perfect way to show Guendeline both the strength of my mind and the depth of my passion.nnI think I'll call her outside and serenade her in front of the whole town!",""
"55049764-14-694","The blessings of Arkay upon you, traveler. It seems you've avoided the miasmata of Gil-Var-Delle.",""
"55049764-14-1055","You have mastered enough recipes to become an apprentice. Are you ready?",""
"55049764-14-1057","You ready to learn something useful?",""
"55049764-14-1058","The crafting  table is over there in the other alcove.",""
"55049764-14-1757","Aldsotha is no longer safe. If you can fight, we can certainly use your help.",""
"55049764-14-2299","Somehow, I had a feeling I'd see you again. Tell me, has Glarikha gotten herself into trouble this time?nnOr is it that the duke didn't take kindly to you questioning his decisions?",""
"55049764-14-2385","My son and daughter mentioned you. From their tales, I'm glad we have you here.nnThis <<1>> is a monster. She sends her men to salt the earth.nnShe destroys the soil and chokes the trees she can't cut down.",""
"55049764-14-2457","If you see Zunaida, please do whatever you can to help her.nnI don't know where she is, though. All I know is that when she departed, she was going northwest into the ruins.nnI didn't mean for this to happen.",""
"55049764-14-2718","There are three victims: two Dunmer and one Argonian. With everyone believing the Shadowscales are at fault, the tension between the races has been high. Had the latest victim not been an Argonian, I'm certain we'd have lost control here.",""
"55049764-14-2726","You didn't live through the flu, did you? No, I can tell. You'd be more careful if you had. You'd keep your hands to yourself. Hold your breath when walking by people. Wear a mask.nnAnd you'd pray a lot more devoutly.",""
"55049764-14-2727","You didn't live through the flu, did you? No, I can tell. You'd be more careful if you had. You'd keep your hands to yourself. Hold your breath when walking by people. Wear a mask.nnAnd you'd pray a lot more devoutly.",""

"55049764-14-3379","That's an interesting twist. It's one of my finer trophy items.nnIf you face my three challenges and survive, I will allow the prisoners to go free.",""
"55049764-14-3392","Don't keep the Phantom waiting. He doesn't like it.",""
"55049764-14-3564","<<1>>. Proud of you. Learned all I can teach you.nnHead to Wayrest. Learn more, craft more. Inspire others. Luck.",""
"55049764-14-3714","I was … asleep? What am I doing in this hovel? And who are you?nnNo, I remember. Stenwick brought me here. I was … sick. Apologies, but I still don't remember who you are.",""
"55049764-14-3760","We'll need to patrol the entire northern perimeter of <<1>>. It's the only way to get a complete picture of the Imperial positions.nnOkay, it's not really the only way. If you want to attack them, I'll just wait back at the camp.",""
"55049764-14-3764","Sir Etienne is all right. That puts my mind at ease.nnNow I do need your help. This is more of a challenge than I expected.",""
"55049764-14-3772","I don't trust anyone in this town. Why won't they tell me exactly what the cure is? Why can't we leave town afterwards?nnAnd if they have a remedy, why can't they tell me what's wrong with Draven?",""
"55049764-14-3776","We are a peaceful town, but we are not without our defenses. I'll ask that you keep on your best behavior while you remain in our village.",""
"55049764-14-3991","You've fought like a true Nord. The skalds will remember your deeds in story and song.nnAnd I'll remember you. <<1>> always remembers his friends.",""
"55049764-14-3996","Ah! You see these miserable spirits? They need not suffer this way.",""
"55049764-14-4011","Make your decision.nnThese men are already dead. They are beyond mortal concerns.",""
"55049764-14-4169","I don't care anymore. I've lost everything now.nnIf you want to stop that monster, you'll need to find Ra-shadda.",""
"55049764-14-4179","Kynareth's blessing, recruit. Do you have the blade?",""
"55049764-14-4180","Open your backpack and read the rune scroll to learn the recipe. If you've already managed to lose the scroll - really novice, care now - just talk to <<1>>. nnHe should have another one to sell you.",""
"55049764-14-4192","You've learned all I can teach you, apprentice.nnHead to Mournhold. Learn more, craft more. Inspire others on their own journeys.",""
"55049764-14-4221","You've proven yourself worthy of becoming one of our subjects. What is your name?",""
"55049764-14-4494","Did you find <<1>>?nnAnd the Fangs … did you get the Fangs of Sithis?",""
"55049764-14-4513","Keep moving, comrade.",""
"55049764-14-4563","The ruins of <<1>> are a dark and dangerous place. Tread carefully, Adept.",""
"55049764-14-4688","I'll be right behind you. Don't worry.",""
"55049764-14-4702","This is our refuge and our sanctuary. We all owe you a debt of gratitude.",""
"55049764-14-4745","I'm Thulvald. We're here to set up a logging camp, but it's not going very well. nnI almost believe we've been cursed.",""
"55049764-14-4778","Thank you for heeding my courier's call. We have much to discuss, Adept.nnThe return of Shalidor is at hand.",""
"55049764-14-4779","Thank you for heeding my courier's call. We have much to discuss, Adept.nnThe return of Shalidor is at hand.",""
"55049764-14-4904","Please, talk to <<1>> at the cave, She was witness to Gwaering's, I mean, the Green Lady's next deed.",""
"55049764-14-4913","Enjoy your stay with the Dancing Scrib. You're as good a friend as anyone's ever been to me.",""
"55049764-14-4964","The audience hall is above us. I'll be there as quickly as I can. If you can challenge the Hound, I'll have time to break through the barrier.",""
"55049764-14-5096","She's running things out of the Guildhall in Davon's Watch at the moment. The Eight guide you, comrade.",""
"55049764-14-5111","Valaste will be expecting you at the Elden Root Guildhall. I'll see you there, Adept.",""
"55049764-14-5128","If you get the civilians to the Fighters Guild, I'll give them weapons and a little training.nnIt'll be along the lines of ""pointy end goes that way,"" but that's better than if they just run around panicked.",""

"55049764-14-5145","Ahh, the guild's spear returns. Aelif had hoped she would see you soon.",""
"55049764-14-5790","It's been one thing after another, lately. Sickness, bandits … I can't remember a fouler time.",""
"55049764-14-5795","I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ignore you. Is there something you need?",""
"55049764-14-5856","Aelif is certain this ruin will yield answers.",""
"55049764-14-5859","No matter what the Phantom decides to do about you, I think you're fascinating.",""
"55049764-14-5895","No time for talk. Kill the draugr!",""
"55049764-14-5900","Oh, hello dearie. Here for the Boast? Of course you are. Everyone wants a chance to visit the Five Finger Dance.",""
"55049764-14-5911","By the moons! You made it through the gate! Who in Oblivion are you?",""
"55049764-14-5920","Bright moons, walker.",""
"55049764-14-6066","We never really got to say thank you, Hallowed. You stood beside us at Rawl'kha. Saw our parents, saw our past. Thank you for your guidance and friendship. It means a great deal to us.",""
"55049764-14-6099","Don't worry about Kalari. Just mulling what she should do next.",""
"55049764-14-6292","That was fascinating, Hallowed! If I had my way the whole Path would be learning about history. Heh, I'd bet if Khali were here she'd be bored silly about now.",""
"55049764-14-6422","Did she tell you? One of the greatest mysteries of Valenwood has finally been solved! Decades of conflicting rumors have been put to rest. nnWe finally know what happened to the Blackroot Clan! They died … right here in Vullain!",""
"55049764-14-6440","That cistern sounds like our best bet. Let's hope Cadwell knows what he's doing.",""
"55049764-14-6441","All right! Ready to knock some heads together? I can't wait to get my hands around Mannimarco's neck.",""
"55049764-14-6593","Stay sharp out there, and stay clear of their patrols. If you lose your disguise, you'll probably be able to find a new one in one of the houses. Don't worry, you'll do fine.",""
"55049764-14-6594","Bright moons light your path. If I am wrong, you have a thousand of my apologies. But … I do not think I am wrong.",""
"55049764-14-6756","The Harvest Heart has been destroyed and the vampires are no longer a threat to our forces.nnAll in all, I'd say we earned our pay this day. Thanks for your help, my friend.",""
"55049764-14-6757","Ahh, it is you. You stood beside the Champions at Fort Grimwatch and drove off the Dro-m'Athra. This one feels the cool light of the moons flowing from your aura.",""
"55049764-14-6978","Fancy meeting you here, my friend! It's good to see you again.",""
"55049764-14-6981","Don't let your eyes deceive you. They trick your senses and tempt your soul.",""
"55049764-14-7009","Bright moons guide your path, traveler.",""
"55049764-14-7043","Now we just need to find the Shade of Naemon …  and destroy him.",""
"55049764-14-7118","The dig site's not too far away. Just around the bend! One of these bends.nnI don't mind if you take your time. I'm just happy to be walking again.",""
"55049764-14-7194","Thank you for coming so quickly, champion. nnI've been consulting with Countess Hakruba of the Fighters Guild. Both of our guilds believe the time has come to take the fight to Coldharbour, but this places us in a delicate political position.",""
"55049764-14-7430","Finally, we're done. Hopefully we'll get to the fighting soon. Heh, I'd bet if Shazah were here she'd be happy as a cub in moon-sugar about now.",""
"55049764-14-7508","We did it. We got him. Sai's going to be all right. nnThank you.",""
"55049764-14-7511","Sahan is injured, but it appears that he can walk on his own. He's stronger than I thought.",""
"55049764-14-7622","We have received the blessings of Stendarr. The door to the Vault of Kings is the only thing that stands between us and the amulet!",""
"55049764-14-7623","That's the last shrine. Let's get the amulet and get out of here!",""
"55049764-14-7701","We aren't in the habit of trusting outsiders, but the suffering of the forest seems to have softened my sister's heart.nnIf you really wish to help us, I suppose that's an offer we can't refuse.",""
"55049764-14-7748","Are we finally done with that shrine nonsense? Can we please get what we came for and leave this wretched hole in the ground?",""
"55049764-14-7809","Now you know how this sordid situation began. And you know how I, to my great and everlasting shame, helped Baron Montclair reach the Lightless Remnant.nnBut now to more immediate matters. I know where Reezal-Jul can be found.",""
"55049764-14-7858","You have been extremely helpful, Five-Claw. We unraveled the threads of this plot with skill and daring. Like unrolling a spool of yarn. Yarn ….nnSorry. This one gets easily distracted sometimes. What were we talking about?",""
"55049764-14-7941","All my best things are at my second camp, through these ruins. nnThen we'll need to make our way over to my first camp, by the dig site. Unfortunately, its overrun by Goblins.",""
"55049764-14-8333","We need to clear this portion of the veil so that we can move forward.nnSee if you can rip open a tear and shred this illusion.",""
"55049764-14-8346","I don't understand. Arlie loves me. She told me so! And what could the Baroness possibly have to hide in that windmill? I'm so … confused.",""
"55049764-14-8455","Look at this place. How could Grell let it get this bad? He was never what you'd call neat, but he wasn't a slob, either.nnHe stocked up on the Maulborn curative, gathered his friends, and was going to ride out the plague. I wonder what happened?",""
"55049764-14-8658","We'll need each one of our members to contribute their talents when we the Whispered Ball. But first, I have a special mission just for you.",""
"55049764-14-8667","Help me check the body. See if you can find anything useful.",""
"55049764-14-8707","Is it done? Do you have <<Az:1>>?",""
"55049764-14-8742","Let's keep looking around.",""
"55049764-14-8808","Don't worry about, Gwen. She'll be fine.",""
"55049764-14-8809","Wish I had those skills.",""
"55049764-14-8810","Security here is terrible. Just because you believe your island is secret doesn't mean it's safe.",""
"55049764-14-8811","Hush. Pay attention.",""
"55049764-14-8925","I don't know about you, but I had fun working alongside you. Maybe we can do it again sometime.",""
"55049764-14-8933","I'll stay here and make sure the spawning pools can be used again. Until the Serpent's plans have been thwarted, I'm sure our paths will cross again.",""
"55049764-14-8947","Hah, you walked away clean! No discolored bites, no tail-crushed ribs … definitely one of our more successful expeditions.",""
"55049764-14-8949","I am told I am … strident in my view about the undead. Regardless of your views, or situation, I respect your deeds.",""
"55049764-14-8954","Take the homespun gloves you made and deconstruct them at a clothing station. Let me know when you're done.nnYou could deconstruct another piece of clothing—it's fine, as long as you grasp the concept.",""
"55049764-14-8966","Craft a glyph using a rune of potency, essence, and aspect. Return when you have forged intent into form.",""
"55049764-15-6","Maybe when Guendeline hears that I died in battle, she'll regret turning me away. Maybe she'll finally love me. Even in death, that would be worth it.nnAt the very least, I hope she feels guilty.",""
"55049764-15-694","I am glad you've come to us instead of trying to scale Gil-Var-Delle. The miasmata of Cold Harbor would have sent you to a grisly fate.",""
"55049764-15-1055","Are you ready to learn your first recipe?",""
"55049764-15-1058","Is the rune ready? Hmm? Otherwise we can do some exercises with a soul gem. I know I have one around here somewhere.",""
"55049764-15-2299","Again, thank you for understanding my position. nnDuke Renchant is a very intelligent man, and he will make the right decisions to ensure that Evermore does not fall.",""
"55049764-15-2385","You're here to help? You've come at a good time.nnThis <<1>> is a monster. She sends her men to salt the earth.nnShe destroys the soil and chokes the trees she can't cut down.",""

"55049764-15-2718","I'm glad to see you've returned. Were you able to find any indications of who the murderer may really be?",""
"55049764-15-2726","How do I know you're not sick? Just stay away from us.",""
"55049764-15-2727","How do I know you're not sick? Just stay away from us.",""
"55049764-15-2728","How do I know you're not sick? Just stay away from us.",""
"55049764-15-3379","At last we meet! I've been watching you since you first arrived.nnYou've provided quite a spectacle by slaughtering my men!",""
"55049764-15-3564","You did well to join us, <<1>>. It never hurts to learn a trade.",""
"55049764-15-3714","Put the amulet on the altar. If he told you to bring it, it must be for something important.",""
"55049764-15-3764","How did you get here? Wait, don't answer that. Just tell me that you can help.nnThere are so few of us left, we could use another able-bodied soldier in our ranks.",""
"55049764-15-3772","It's the waiting that's the worst. If Kerbol has some magical cure, why doesn't she just give it to my husband? To all of these poor souls!nnAre you also waiting to see Kerbol?",""
"55049764-15-3991","The Covenant's inside the city! Let's hope your blade is thirsty.",""
"55049764-15-4011","Make your decision. These men are already dead. Why give up power we could harness today?",""

"55049764-15-4180","I can feel the flow of magicka around you. Is the rune ready?",""
"55049764-15-4192","Learning a trade gives you yet one more way to participate in the war. Fresh supplies for the front are like cool rain on the snout.",""
"55049764-15-4221","You there! Untie us.",""
"55049764-15-4494","How could I have let this happen? Maybe the Fangs got to <<1>> through his natural greed.nnI should've known … should've warned him.",""

"55049764-15-4745","Please, find my workers. They followed me out here, and I feel responsible for them.",""
"55049764-15-4778","I've seen you in a dream, Adept. I know your face. I know your voice.nnThe breath of Auri-El has touched me. Shalidor must be within reach.",""

"55049764-15-4904","I am Aldor, the Spinner of Deepwoods. I come out here to meet pilgrims and tell them about Gwaering, our esteemed Green Lady.nnI spotted werewolves on the road, though, and I've been afraid to go back to the village.",""
"55049764-15-4964","At last, the Hound is dead.nnI stripped away Hircine's influence from the Green Lady, but only because you kept the Hound occupied.",""
"55049764-15-5087","I'd hoped to find you here, Adept.",""

"55049764-15-5128","Where's the captain? I can't believe she and the rest fell to the Redguard Ra Gada that quickly.",""
"55049764-15-5135","We have the advantage. The mercenaries know only what they can hit with their swords. We Khajiits know when to put down the sword and take up a rose.nnOr in this case, a keg of rich drink.",""
"55049764-15-5795","My husband is cursed. I have no time to speak with outsiders.",""
"55049764-15-5859","So, did you kill those pitfighters just for the fun of it? nnI hope so.",""
"55049764-15-5895","This place is known as Vuldngrav, the final resting place of Korthor the Dragon Priest. Tread carefully. Where there are Dragon Priests, there are sure to be draugr.",""

"55049764-15-6066","Shazah is happy to see you again, my friend. Khali is champing at the bit. She has grown tired of these Dro-m'Athra, and hungers for bigger game.",""
"55049764-15-6292","I've heard of these! Mane Jinninji-ri had them installed almost six hundred years ago during one of the many temple refurbishings. They were thought lost!",""
"55049764-15-6440","Sir Cadwell always seems to turn up when we need him the most. Maybe he really is a knight.",""
"55049764-15-6444","There is much to do. We need every warrior out in the field.",""
"55049764-15-6593","Uplifting stuff, huh? That Lavinia has a way with words.",""
"55049764-15-6594","Bright moons, traveler. I am Kazirra, Clanmother of the Arenthia. Cari tells me we can expect great things out of you. That's good. We'll need all the help we can get.",""

"55049764-15-7430","Great, a history lesson. As if I didn't get enough of those growing up. I think Shazah told me about these things. One of the old Manes … Jinninji-ri? Had them installed years and years ago.",""
"55049764-15-7476","Greetings, warrior. Are you ready for a mission of critical importance to the Pact?",""

"55049764-15-7508","There he is! Let's finish this!",""
"55049764-15-7511","Nice of you to check in with me, but I think Sai is more in need of your attentions.",""
"55049764-15-7622","It is done. Through the antechamber, quickly! The Amulet of Kings is close at hand, I can feel it.",""
"55049764-15-7623","Sai went on and on about how this was supposed to be a sacred site. Bull sausage! Place makes my blood run cold.",""
"55049764-15-7748","This really is the most ridiculous security imaginable for such a priceless artifact.",""
"55049764-15-7809","We must go through this all again, but that doesn't make it any easier.nnI hate seeing my good friend's wife suffer as she did before.",""
"55049764-15-7858","These assassins. They thought they were hunting us. Now Adusa turns the tables. Now we hunt them!",""
"55049764-15-7941","Now that Stibbons is on the mend, we can pack up the camp and move on to our next expedition!nnYou were quite adequate, for a temporary assistant. But you're no Stibbons. If I were in your position, I'd consider pursuing another line of work.",""
"55049764-15-8333","While I continue my research, you should head to Northpoint. Gwendis caught wind of Lleraya in that area, and I had her direct Dorell and Tamrith to take their troops north.nnI'm sure they'd appreciate any help you can provide.",""
"55049764-15-8346","I can't believe it. Dulkhi has always been the sweetest thing.",""
"55049764-15-8455","What was my brother thinking, keeping uncle's condition from me.nnWhen we find Dethisam, he's going to get a piece of my mind. Right after I give him a good, swift kick.",""
"55049764-15-8667","I can't wait to see the look on his face.",""
"55049764-15-8707","I wish I was there to see the look on <<1>>'s face. You'll have to describe it for me. I'll hire an artist to make a painting.",""

"55049764-15-8809","Hope she makes it across.",""
"55049764-15-8811","I've never seen an Ayleid ruin like this!",""
"55049764-15-8925","I'm not here to fight you. You're the one who helped Cassi, aren't you? She told me all about it.nnAre you busy? Maybe you can help me with something. It's rather important.",""
"55049764-15-8933","Are you ready to hear my proposition now?",""
"55049764-15-8947","You're back! Hoo, that's quite a smell. Make sure to talk to me later if you want to burn that … everything.",""

"55049764-15-8954","You know, I'm a master clothier, yet I still own a pair of homespun gloves? They keep my hands warm at night. Sometimes simple is better.",""

"55049764-16-6","You gave her the daisies? Was she happy? Did she swoon? What did she say? nnTell me. Tell me. Tell me.",""
"55049764-16-1055","Are you ready to learn how to research another's work?",""
"55049764-16-1058","I smell magicka! What do you have for me?",""
"55049764-16-2299","So much suffering. So much death. Like my husband and my children, this soldier gave her life for Evermore. nnI wish I could offer her more comfort, but I can only pray with her to gods whose mercy I have come to doubt.",""
"55049764-16-2457","You look like you have something to tell me.nnWell, what is it?",""

"55049764-16-4688","I'll be able to rest soon enough, adept. Shalidor is the only reason I was able to finish. His enthusiasm and energy sustained me through this difficult trial.",""

"55049764-16-7043","There. We're in Shadow Wood again, as foul as it ever was. We should be able to bypass the blight though … and all the feral guardians that would block our way.nnOnce we get in there, we need to head for the Grotto—that's where the Heart is.",""
"55049764-16-7430","Old Rid-Thar! Good to see him again. This has got to be a good sign, right?",""

"55049764-22-8947","All this reminds me, Tharayya still owes me a drink for what she did in that bar that one time. Heh, that was a good week.",""
"55049764-22-8949","Please be sure to speak to someone about your worldly possessions. The alternative is someone like Turuk Redclaws picking over your corpse.",""

"55049764-24-8947","Daedra are all cowards at heart. Unfortunately, a lot of them don't have hearts. Or they've removed them, or something. Anyway, Daedra are dangerous.",""
"55049764-24-8949","Do not let the thought of blood-drinking corpses put you off, Undaunted. Do not allow the fear of an unholy, unending life stay your blade.",""

"55049764-25-7622","The Amulet of Kings is in our possession and the traitor Mannimarco has been defeated. But we are not yet finished. The blessings of Akatosh must be restored if Nirn is to remain safe. nnBut tonight, we rest.",""

"55049764-25-7748","I know what you're thinking, Vestige. You want to thank me for my noble and heroic effort in helping you defeat that treacherous worm, Mannimarco. No need to laud me, though. The world already knows of my brilliance. But you're welcome nonetheless.",""
"55049764-25-8947","What are you waiting for? Go put an axe in that Daedra-scum's head! Aim for the neck, and follow through with your shoulders. That's what I'd do.",""
"55049764-25-8949","Waste no more breath here, Undaunted. Your words will not stop the spider cult, or return you to me safely.",""
"55049764-25-8954","Craft an iron dagger. You'll need some iron ingots and a style material. You can buy those from any blacksmith if you can't find them yourself.",""
"55049764-25-8966","You show promise in every discipline I certify. Perhaps you seek to challenge my position as thrice-accredited master craftsman.nnIf so, <<1>> offers blacksmith, clothier, and woodworking certification. I last saw her at the local Fighters Guild.",""

"55049764-26-8954","Refining ore into ingots is a good way to build your muscles. Well, in one arm.nnBest to switch every now and then. Otherwise, you'll be lopsided.",""

"55049764-29-8966","At times I wonder if I should have remained a chef rather than join the Mages Guild. Perhaps I'd have served the Emperor. ""Served"" … a jest, you see?nnBut I have no regrets. Mastery of three crafts is its own reward.",""
