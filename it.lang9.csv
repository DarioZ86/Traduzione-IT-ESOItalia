"115740052-0-7772","This potion... it will stop the way I feel?",""
"115740052-0-7773","Let us say instead, it will make you both forgot what you feel and why you ever felt it in the first place.",""

"115740052-0-7782","An outsider's seen us. We need to run.",""
"115740052-0-7783","I do. I have duties to my guild as well, but I can't help the way I feel. I can't believe you want me to forget this. To take some concoction and forget how I feel.",""
"115740052-0-7784","It will be easier. We will simply forget the things which made us fall in love. We will know each other, that won't change. But we will only be friends.",""
"115740052-0-7785","I don't want to be just friends. I prefer heartache over forgetting the good. This concoction is a perversion of magic and a perversion of what we shared.",""
"115740052-0-7786","What we share. Why won't you think of me, think of my feelings? I can't stand how this makes me feel. I won't tolerate it. We don't have to live like this. Just do this last thing for me.",""

"115740052-0-7810","Enough of this! I will have you all executed!",""
"115740052-0-7811","By Mauloch, you will not! Die, centurion!",""

"115740052-0-8709","Thank you, friend. We have kept her body in our home a few more days.",""
"115740052-0-8710","Because of the Withered Hand?",""
"115740052-0-8711","Yes, indirectly. Their influence here has caused ritual prices to rise. I could not afford it.",""
"115740052-0-8712","By the gods, that is horrific. Is nothing sacred now?",""
"115740052-0-8713","Indeed. I didn't think you could put a price on sanctity.",""

"115740052-0-8715","Are you assuming there are Withered Hand among the temple priests?",""

"115740052-0-8717","What's the matter? You look shaken today.",""
"115740052-0-8718","I think I saw your mother walking around the desert outside the city yesterday.",""
"115740052-0-8719","That's impossible. My mother's been dead for three years.",""
"115740052-0-8720","I know.",""
"115740052-0-8721","What did you do? Did she say anything?",""
"115740052-0-8722","I don't know. I ran. The dead are sacred, and I'm not one to dishonor them by disturbing their slumber.",""
"115740052-0-8723","So you ran away? That's not exactly honorable as well.",""
"115740052-0-8724","I'd rather be a coward than a blasphemer. Maybe she'll show up at your door today. If she does, you try talking to a corpse.",""
"115740052-0-8725","Our king is a shrewd man.",""
"115740052-0-8726","How do you mean?",""
"115740052-0-8727","Haven't you heard? Somebody cleared the Rain Catchers. Our water is clean again.",""
"115740052-0-8728","And how does this make the King shrewd?",""
"115740052-0-8729","Because he had someone clear the Rain Catchers silently and without drawing attention to it.",""
"115740052-0-8730","And before the people started to grumble. I see what you mean.",""
"115740052-0-8731","Exactly. I imagine this hero as a tall, honorable Redguard with shining armor and a brilliantly curved sword. What do you think?",""
"115740052-0-8732","I don't know. I'm beginning to trust fewer and fewer of our people as it is. Especially with those necromancers running loose in the desert.",""
"115740052-0-8733","I may have been harsh before about our Covenant brethren.",""
"115740052-0-8734","How do you mean?",""
"115740052-0-8735","I've seen many brave Orcs and Bretons fighting the necromancers in the desert.",""
"115740052-0-8736","They're fighting the Withered Hand? Why would they be doing that? That's our business.",""
"115740052-0-8737","Those warriors are doing what our men cannot. They're fighting our honored dead.",""
"115740052-0-8738","I have a good mind to call them cowards for attacking our ancestors like that.",""
"115740052-0-8739","And I have a good mind to commend them for bravery. They're defying the gods in order to save our land.",""
"115740052-0-8740","I guess you're right. Let's hope their gods are more forgiving.",""
"115740052-0-8741","Are you still troubled, my friend?",""
"115740052-0-8742","Of course I am. As long as there are men on earth, there will be signs of strife.",""
"115740052-0-8743","That's not quite a Crown way of thinking. What changed your mind?",""
"115740052-0-8744","No, it isn't. There've been some hopeful events as of late.",""
"115740052-0-8745","Such as what?",""
"115740052-0-8746","Onsi has sent us brave warriors to fight against evil.",""
"115740052-0-8747","Yes. These strangers do ease the tensions some.",""
"115740052-0-8748","The Forebears look to these brave souls as guardians for a new age. I can't share their optimism, though. To me, they're more signs of trouble ahead.",""
"115740052-0-8749","Don't be so pessimistic. There's still hope.",""
"115740052-0-8750","If hope can only come through eternal struggle, then may Onsi put his sword to rest forever.",""
"115740052-0-8751","I will never understand magic. It's too illogical. I cannot understand why Julianos allows it in this world.",""
"115740052-0-8752","Death is permanent, despite how some men manipulate it. Why would death magic be any different?",""
"115740052-0-8753","I hope Saturah's children abide by those same rules.",""
"115740052-0-8754","We'll never know unless the Withered Hand are wiped out completely.",""
"115740052-0-8755","You're right! The only way to truly kill a necromancer is to kill all necromancers.",""
"115740052-0-8756","The Ansei Wards have been restored, but I don't understand why I still see the dead walking around.",""
"115740052-0-8757","Or hope that he has no friends willing to revive him.",""
"115740052-0-8758","Save the villagers! Find our people!",""
"115740052-0-8759","The Withered Hand were powerful magicians. You can't expect their power to wane automatically.",""
"115740052-0-8760","Guards to the front! We have a mad one here!",""
"115740052-0-8761","blows the whistle.",""

"115740052-0-8814","We're almost there. Soon, the Maulborn will give us the cure!",""
"115740052-0-8815","If they get to me in time.",""
"115740052-0-8816","Of course they will. You'll be fine.",""
"115740052-0-8817","If it doesn't work, you should know I've always ….",""
"115740052-0-8818","Don't say it. There's a cure. There has to be.",""
"115740052-0-8819","Another despairing soul?",""
"115740052-0-8820","The faith of our people is weak, but I will change that.",""
"115740052-0-8821","One moment, traveler.",""
"115740052-0-8822","Who is this now?",""
"115740052-0-8823","We will get to the bottom of this.",""
"115740052-0-8824","Their leader comes! Take him down.",""
"115740052-0-8825","Who's fallen? And where are my sons? Find them!",""
"115740052-0-8826","You should be able to hear me now.",""
"115740052-0-8827","Are you following me?",""
"115740052-0-8828","Not so close. He's getting suspicious.",""
"115740052-0-8829","There he is. Let's follow him.",""
"115740052-0-8830","He went into that shack. Wait for him to leave.",""
"115740052-0-8831","My retainers. I can't protect them.",""
"115740052-0-8832","Run. Goblins have overrun our fields.",""

"115740052-0-8834","Those goblin beasts should suffer.",""

"115740052-0-8836","He's out. That was fast.",""
"115740052-0-8837","Try to get inside that shack.",""

"115740052-0-8840","Oh for … what now, Rhavil?",""
"115740052-0-8841","So you're the meddler who undid all of Rhavil's work.",""
"115740052-0-8842","Such a waste of my time.",""
"115740052-0-8843","The dead depend on you. You must consecrate them.",""
"115740052-0-8844","A communication spell? Let's see who Rhavil called.",""
"115740052-0-8845","Error. The event system is broken.",""
"115740052-0-8846","That woman wore a Covenant uniform.",""
"115740052-0-8847","Rhavil must be working for the enemy.",""

"115740052-0-8860","I feel it! The coral speaks to me.",""
"115740052-0-8861","I'll meet you in its heart.",""
"115740052-0-8862","My friend! Can you hear me?",""
"115740052-0-8863","The coral is dying. The Breton stole its heart!",""
"115740052-0-8864","The dreugh serve us now, but it's not enough. Find me at the heart.",""
"115740052-0-8865","Take our heart. Keep it safe. The coral and I can now live without it.",""
"115740052-0-8866","Soldier. Urgency impels us. We must keep the Covenant from getting the Coral Heart.",""

"115740052-0-8873","Eyes open, now.",""
"115740052-0-8874","Praise Tall Papa, Hallin's Stand is free once more!",""
"115740052-0-8875","I'll be here if you change your mind.",""
"115740052-0-8876","Is someone there? Help me! Please!",""
"115740052-0-8877","Enough, I yield. You fight like wamasu!",""
"115740052-0-8878","The Covenant will have to leave eventually.",""
"115740052-0-8879","Unless the Tribunal sent you about the Covenant troops, you had best move on.",""
"115740052-0-8880","My family will drive those Covenant bastards off our land!",""
"115740052-0-8881","I am sure Saalu did not weep. Neither will I.",""
"115740052-0-8882","Excellent work! Meet <<1>> and me when you're finished.",""
"115740052-0-8883","<Beast scream>",""
"115740052-0-8884","They'll think twice before attacking us again.",""
"115740052-0-8885","I thought we'd never see the end of Imperial oppression.",""
"115740052-0-8886","Tu'whacca sent that stranger to aid us in our darkest hour.",""
"115740052-0-8887","You have disobeyed my orders for the last time!",""
"115740052-0-8888","Enough! I will drag you back to Oblivion with me!",""
"115740052-0-8889","You bear a gift? How thoughtful! But I can't accept it without providing one of my own.",""
"115740052-0-8890","I know! I'll share the same gift I gave <<1>>. Now you can play skeever-wicket with your own skull! Hahaha!",""
"115740052-0-8891","Something is rotten in Tal'Deic Fortress.",""
"115740052-0-8892","The general's death is a blow to the Ebonheart Pact.",""
"115740052-0-8893","I have a few things to say.",""
"115740052-0-8894","You talk way too much. Let's stop now.",""
"115740052-0-8895","Did you hear that Angof was defeated? What a rush!",""
"115740052-0-8896","I can't wait until someone takes out that Angof fellow.",""
"115740052-0-8897","Come. We have many preparations to make.",""
"115740052-0-8898","Hey! Over here! Help me!",""
"115740052-0-8899","The Hist is in my mind. So strange! I must … I must ….",""
"115740052-0-8900","No! Don't take the medicine!",""
"115740052-0-8901","I need that … please ….",""
"115740052-0-8902","I'll die without that. I'll die.",""
"115740052-0-8903","No! Don't take the medicine!",""
"115740052-0-8904","I need that … please ….",""
"115740052-0-8905","I'll die without that. I'll die.",""
"115740052-0-8906","Help! The Ashlanders have surrounded us!",""
"115740052-0-8907","What? What are you doing?",""
"115740052-0-8908","I've returned. My thanks.",""
"115740052-0-8909","No one goes into the Gorge. Got that?",""
"115740052-0-8910","Do we say why the pass is closed?",""
"115740052-0-8911","Tell them there's death in the pass. Leave it at that.",""
"115740052-0-8912","Yes, Commander!",""
"115740052-0-8913","It worked! Oh, and it's so beautiful. I must tell the others!",""
"115740052-0-8914","They say an outsider fought off the Imperials single-handedly.",""
"115740052-0-8915","I hope the Imperials learned a lesson once and for all.",""
"115740052-0-8916","Did you ever find out who saved Hallin's Stand?",""
"115740052-0-8917","The one who saved us is right over there. Tall Papa bless you, stranger!",""
"115740052-0-8918","High Rock and Hammerfell!",""
"115740052-0-8919","House Hlaalu claims they stopped the Llodos plague that ravaged the Redolant Loam,",""
"115740052-0-8920","I give myself to the power of death!",""
"115740052-0-8921","Yes, I heard the plague was created by some vengeful madwoman.",""
"115740052-0-8922","No doubt House Hlaalu will find a way to make a profit from all this, though.",""
"115740052-0-8923","I'm going back, whether you want me to or not.",""
"115740052-0-8924","I'm going back, whether you want me to or not.",""
"115740052-0-8925","You must not! You'll surely be killed!",""
"115740052-0-8926","I am honor bound. Don't worry, I shall return!",""
"115740052-0-8927","Shor's Bones, there are more Daggers here than we figured.",""
"115740052-0-8928","Ah, finally! A change in the weather.",""
"115740052-0-8929","I smell rain on the wind.",""
"115740052-0-8930","The gates must be unbarred.",""
"115740052-0-8931","Clear the courtyard!",""
"115740052-0-8932","To Sovngarde with him!",""
"115740052-0-8933","My own blade brother. I can't believe it.",""
"115740052-0-8934","Tanval must be stopped!",""
"115740052-0-8935","What can Tanval be thinking?",""
"115740052-0-8936","Glory for the Pact!",""
"115740052-0-8937","Tanval, no! The Coral Heart is too powerful.",""
"115740052-0-8938","Tanval, what have you done?",""
"115740052-0-8939","Psst! Thanks again, friend!",""
"115740052-0-8940","Hey! You nix-hound!",""
"115740052-0-8941","The flag has been stripped due to stealthing!",""
"115740052-0-8942","Get me out of here!",""
"115740052-0-8943","You're always getting into trouble, Saryvn.",""
"115740052-0-8944","You're the one who saved us. Tall Papa bless you!",""
"115740052-0-8945","You there! Thank you for saving our city!",""
"115740052-0-8946","Hallin's Stand will eventually return to normal.",""
"115740052-0-8947","You saved the grandeya from the Imperials, didn't you?",""
"115740052-0-8948","The Orcs in Malak's Maw have been defeated. I heard they were paid by the Covenant.",""
"115740052-0-8949","Their leader, Gruznak the … Impotent? Impetuous?  Well, he was a nasty piece of work.",""
"115740052-0-8950","Indeed.  A tower of skulls and bounty for Dunmer ears collected.  Bastards.",""
"115740052-0-8951","Who disturbs my rest?",""
"115740052-0-8952","Get away from that!",""
"115740052-0-8953","Ah, Stormcrag. Good timing. Come here!",""
"115740052-0-8954","Sorry, Captain. Didn't mean to eavesdrop.",""
"115740052-0-8955","News of the General's death will spread quickly. We must maintain order.",""
"115740052-0-8956","More Dark Elf discipline and protocol? That's what caused this mess.",""
"115740052-0-8957","That's why I want to appoint you as my aide and advisor, so our discipline doesn't blind us again.",""
"115740052-0-8958","Me? Yes, I'd be happy to help keep the fortress on track.",""
"115740052-0-8959","Oh, no—they're still fighting out here.",""
"115740052-0-8960","You push the limits of my hospitality, Captain.",""
"115740052-0-8961","Surely we can compromise on the matter.",""
"115740052-0-8962","Remember, Grandmaster, the urgency of our business.",""
"115740052-0-8963","As you say, Captain. As you say.",""
"115740052-0-8964","You're stronger than these Maulborn idiots!",""
"115740052-0-8965","Morrowind shall be laid waste! Vox will break this land!",""
"115740052-0-8966","Thank you for saving me! I knew Dolril would send help.",""
"115740052-0-8967","Thank the Tribunal! It was getting so hot in here!",""
"115740052-0-8968","Praise Vivec! Did Dolril send you?",""
"115740052-0-8969","I understand you've had your differences with the grandmaster, but I'd hope your loyalty would lie with House Dres.",""
"115740052-0-8970","It gives me great pleasure to watch him squirm. When I grow weary of that, then I may consider assisting him.",""
"115740052-0-8971","I wish you'd reconsider. The future of House Dres is at stake!",""
"115740052-0-8972","The crates are smashed! Finish off the rest of them.",""
"115740052-0-8973","Archers! To your positions!",""
"115740052-0-8974","Once the arrows start flying, they'll be on us in no time.",""
"115740052-0-8975","We did it! All right, back to the cave.",""
"115740052-0-8976","Mind you don't go running off with this.",""
"115740052-0-8977","I can't take much more of this abuse.",""
"115740052-0-8978","Fight hard and come back alive!",""
"115740052-0-8979","Psst! Someone's here. Get scarce.",""
"115740052-0-8980","Get me out of here!",""
"115740052-0-8981","Glad we understand each other.",""
"115740052-0-8982","Mercy! I yield!",""
"115740052-0-8983","Hope the next town in the path of the Covenant army fares better.",""
"115740052-0-8984","Much stabbing, yes. Great fun.",""
"115740052-0-8985","You don't look so tough.",""
"115740052-0-8986","Another pilgrim. Attack!",""
"115740052-0-8987","You can't imagine the horrors in that thing!",""
"115740052-0-8988","Ho, outlander!",""
"115740052-0-8989","Harken to me, stranger.",""
"115740052-0-8990","Here all along, was it? By Sithis, it was right under my feet!",""
"115740052-0-8991","Look what you've done! I've lost count!",""
"115740052-0-8992","I'll feed your heart to my cat!",""
"115740052-0-8993","Useless cat!",""
"115740052-0-8994","Once I dispatch you, Hissmir will be ours!",""
"115740052-0-8995","Wait a breath!",""
"115740052-0-8996","You'd kill our people to save them? What madness is that?",""
"115740052-0-8997","My warriors won't allow you to perpetrate this foolishness.",""
"115740052-0-8998","You should've stayed out of this!",""
"115740052-0-8999","You can't be so cruel. This is eternal torment!",""
"115740052-0-9000","My acolytes won't allow you to curse us with life!",""
"115740052-0-9001","Time to skin a cat.",""
"115740052-0-9002","We are fortunate indeed!",""
"115740052-0-9003","Hey! What are you doing?",""
"115740052-0-9004","What the—?",""
"115740052-0-9005","Oh. no! My poor wasps!",""
"115740052-0-9006","That ought to make the Khajiit suffer!",""
"115740052-0-9007","I'll take those!",""
"115740052-0-9008","You there! I will cloak you in shadow. Enter the portal and witness our victory.",""
"115740052-0-9009","You've felt the true splendor of my gift to <<1>>. What gift have you for them, I wonder?",""
"115740052-0-9010","I will follow them to make sure they remain safe.",""
"115740052-0-9011","Preserve their existence or end it forever. Which will it be? Probably the boring one.",""
"115740052-0-9012","Please, find any other survivors, then come see me!",""
"115740052-0-9013","What a beautiful sight it is! One-Eye can't wait to get her talons on it.",""
"115740052-0-9014","S'jash will take care of this. You have business to attend to with One-Eye.",""
"115740052-0-9015","Heartless oaf! You'd destroy everyone in <<1>>, despite the ones who clearly wish to go on? All to end a pain and sickness they can no longer feel? How delicious.",""
"115740052-0-9016","Callous brute! You would remove their capacity to truly die, forcing them to suffer their endless existence until the end of time? Are you too weak to allow them the rest deserved by all mortal creatures? How intoxicating.",""
"115740052-0-9017","I must inform the vicecanon of this situation!",""
"115740052-0-9018","Now begone.",""
"115740052-0-9019","That accursed rock contains more horrors than Oblivion!",""
"115740052-0-9020","Inside that thing is … nothing! You cannot imagine!",""
"115740052-0-9021","Death will release me from the nothingness inside that thing.",""
"115740052-0-9022","It seems we have an unexpected guest!",""
"115740052-0-9023","Here's your hero, Elf.",""
"115740052-0-9024","I do love a good raid!",""
"115740052-0-9025","You've done a great service for the Pact.",""
"115740052-0-9026","It can't be. They wouldn't.",""
"115740052-0-9027","Someone, please help me!",""
"115740052-0-9028","The other one, the Elf? He ran right past me. Well, a good deed is its own reward.",""
"115740052-0-9029","Open the windows! Out of my way! Don't let them bite you!",""
"115740052-0-9030","It's just not safe here anymore.",""
"115740052-0-9031","Now we'll see about this journal.",""
"115740052-0-9032","We must act now.",""
"115740052-0-9033","Now we'll see to our defenses.",""
"115740052-0-9034","Someone needs to take on these mercenaries.",""
"115740052-0-9035","I'll run this shop better than he ever did.",""
"115740052-0-9036","The ingredients are all I need! But how to get them ….",""
"115740052-0-9037","This will work. I'm sure of it.",""
"115740052-0-9038","The Shadowscale Enclave must know about this.",""
"115740052-0-9039","We must focus on the problem at hand.",""
"115740052-0-9040","Necromancers are in Shadowfen. Someone needs to do something.",""
"115740052-0-9041","The Worm Cult is the real problem.",""
"115740052-0-9042","The Kothringi are upon us! Quickly, activate the Zaht stones.",""
"115740052-0-9043","Such power! Were it ever to fall into the Kothringi's hands ….",""
"115740052-0-9044","Over here! Can you help me?",""
"115740052-0-9045","Where's the Argonian who did this?",""
"115740052-0-9046","Neposh knew the terms when he summoned me!",""
"115740052-0-9047","You say for this next trial I'll need to run? Fine.",""
"115740052-0-9048","These words are so final.",""
"115740052-0-9049","How troubling!",""
"115740052-0-9050","Never again!",""
"115740052-0-9051","Ha! I knew you'd be no trouble!",""
"115740052-0-9052","The Zaht stone must not be activated!",""
"115740052-0-9053","You are intriguing. Won't you come with me?",""

"115740052-0-11170","It will be done.",""
"115740052-0-11171","I  will do more research and talk to Jomund. An interesting find indeed..",""

"115740052-0-11197","Don't put words in my mouth, Dark Elf. I said you could enter Fort Amol. But the inn is full, so you can't stay. Official business of the kingdom takes precedence, after all.",""

"115740052-0-11252","You just have to poke your nose into things that don't concern you, don't you? You can join the rest of the bodies in here!",""
"115740052-0-11253","Hmm… how interesting. Speak with me, fellow intruder.",""
"115740052-0-11254","Ysgramor protects me still. I'll see you there.",""

"115740052-0-11261","The Archivist has appalling taste in interior decoration.",""

"115740052-0-11264","They're doing something with the soul gems in there.",""

"115740052-0-11276","Drink this elixir and you die quick. Otherwise, the King dies. Simple choice, right?",""
"115740052-0-11277","Ahh!",""
"115740052-0-11278","Move or call out and you lose your tongue. Simple, right?",""
"115740052-0-11279","They … they made me do it. Said they were going to kill my family if I didn't help them. Please, don't kill me!",""
"115740052-0-11280","You have my soul, what more can you want?",""
"115740052-0-11281","Service in torment, slave.",""
"115740052-0-11282","Is that you, Cirion? I don't know how you defeated those banekin but I'll be glad to send more.",""
"115740052-0-11283","Are you an idiot? We're surrounded by the enemy!",""
"115740052-0-11284","Ah. It's the outsiders. So the Keepers are afraid to face me. Very well. You'll die in their stead.",""
"115740052-0-11285","The big bad Stormfists are outside? Maybe we should go upstairs so I can protect you, all proper like.",""
"115740052-0-11286","I'm going to enjoy this!",""
"115740052-0-11287","People really frustrate me sometimes.",""
"115740052-0-11288","We must get into the Vault. I hope I'm wrong about why the Reachmen are here.",""
"115740052-0-11289","Your grooming is vile, ogrim, and your stench is worse.",""
"115740052-0-11290","You grunt, pass gas, and don't laugh at jokes. Bah!",""
"115740052-0-11291","If you throw another ball of that foul snow at me, I'll take your head off.",""
"115740052-0-11292","<Click.>",""
"115740052-0-11293","So you've finally come to the aid of the King.",""
"115740052-0-11294","Miserable creature! I'll settle your hash.",""
"115740052-0-11295","Get away from there!",""
"115740052-0-11296","Dhalen said you were coming after us. Let's see how you handle two of the best warriors of the Stormfist Brigade!",""
"115740052-0-11297","Well done. Too little, too late, though. The false king is dead. Once you join him, Fildgor will rule this land.",""
"115740052-0-11298","Is that it, master, is that what we came here for?",""
"115740052-0-11299","Yes, Wuuthrad is now ours. If the others have done their part, the Nords are doomed!",""

"115740052-0-11303","What? You're here? The Master will be furious!",""
"115740052-0-11304","Servants! Expel this invader!",""
"115740052-0-11305","The Master took your gem hours ago!",""
"115740052-0-11306","Tharn! You've thrown in with the mortal?",""
"115740052-0-11307","Tervur Sadri!",""
"115740052-0-11308","Time to go!",""
"115740052-0-11309","Keep my soul gem as a bauble, will you?",""
"115740052-0-11310","Break the gem! Free my soul!",""
"115740052-0-11311","Finally! It's good to smell even the stench of this foul place!",""
"115740052-0-11312","I know how to find your gem. Come on.",""
"115740052-0-11313","Death to the invaders!",""
"115740052-0-11314","You just killed my son, traitor!",""
"115740052-0-11315","I challenge you for the right to represent our villages!",""
"115740052-0-11316","I concede this bout.",""
"115740052-0-11317","While I keep you busy here, the thane gets a final recruitment offer. If she refuses, she dies.",""

"115740052-0-11320","What would you do to save a loved one?",""
"115740052-0-11321","What about my daughter? The Worm Cult has promised to bring her back and you're in the way!",""
"115740052-0-11322","Do you remember my husband? My son? The Worm Cult will bring them back and you're in the way.",""

"115740052-0-11324","Your legend ends now, hero of Bal Foyen.",""
"115740052-0-11325","You've grown into a beauty, my child.",""
"115740052-0-11326","But I see you have another visitor.",""
"115740052-0-11327","I do think of you asleep over my bed-chamber.",""
"115740052-0-11328","The undead! They march on Fullhelm!",""
"115740052-0-11329","My lord. We're holding the stairs, barely.",""

"115740052-0-11331","I take orders from the Sea Vipers now!",""
"115740052-0-11333","Might be the booze, but that doesn't sound right. Start over.",""
"115740052-0-11334","All these handsome soldiers! Maybe the alchemist can brew something that will attract them to me.",""
"115740052-0-11335","Really? You're that desperate for attention?",""
"115740052-0-11336","Your problem is, you wouldn't know a good opportunity if it bit you on the nose.",""
"115740052-0-11337","What do you think the Skald-King will do about his brother, Fildgor?",""
"115740052-0-11338","I don't know, but I hope he decides something soon. All these outsiders milling about make me nervous.",""
"115740052-0-11339","The lizards aren't so bad. Just a bit odd. But the Dark Elves are an arrogant bunch, the lot of them.",""
"115740052-0-11340","Make this easy, Orc, and I won't hurt you. Much.",""
"115740052-0-11341","I admit it. I'm still a little uneasy about the Argonians joining the alliance and all.",""
"115740052-0-11342","The keep! The keep's on fire!",""
"115740052-0-11343","The keep! The keep's on fire!",""
"115740052-0-11344","It doesn't sit right with everyone, true. But I can't fault their bravery or skill in battle.",""
"115740052-0-11345","There is that. And they have a remarkable tendency to find warm spots where they can sun themselves.",""

"115740052-0-11347","Why hello there <<1>>, it is certain a fine day in this fine town of <<2>> isn't it?",""
"115740052-0-11348","Uh, well, not really, this is pretty much a run down dump and it smells bad. Not to mention I hate the smoke from all these torches.",""
"115740052-0-11349","Yes, yes, very good, perhaps I'll see you at the local pub after hours? Keep your chin up <<1>>!",""
"115740052-0-11350","I'll see you at Fallowstone Hall!",""
"115740052-0-11351","I have string in one pocket, rocks in another, and a dead toad in my shoe.",""
"115740052-0-11352","You were kicked in the head as a sap egg, weren't you?",""
"115740052-0-11353","Well, isn't that nice? Do you have any sandwiches?",""
"115740052-0-11354","Quickly, follow me. This place is crawling with Reachmen!",""
"115740052-0-11355","Hurry, before they spot us!",""
"115740052-0-11356","I can't see anything from here. I need to get inside their camp.",""
"115740052-0-11357","I have a plan.",""
"115740052-0-11358","We need to move; people are dying in there!",""
"115740052-0-11359","Time to get myself captured. Do your part!",""
"115740052-0-11361","Sure does stink over here…yep, smells like my grandma's old handbag.",""
"115740052-0-11362","Please go away.",""
"115740052-0-11363","Sounds good, you know, I always enjoy a good lolly.",""
"115740052-0-11364","I have a little joke I'd like to tell. It had Mary down at the Quartermasters rolling on the floor with laughter. Clearly it was a good one. Would you like to hear it?",""
"115740052-0-11365","Please, try to never talk to me, I hate you, everyone hates you. You're very annoying. Go away.",""
"115740052-0-11366","So you see, there were these two peanuts, they were walking through the park, enjoying the day. I know it's silly that peanuts are walking or enjoying anything, but that's the key to the joke. And you know what happened? One was assaulted. Get it?",""
"115740052-0-11367","Hmmm…<<1>> seems rather down…I wonder what I could to for him…her…well, whatever, I wonder what I can do to cheer <<1>> up?",""
"115740052-0-11368","I know! I'll throw <<1>> a birthday party! I'm sure she…he…or whatever, will love it! Everyone loves birthday parties! Now, I wonder if those kind of people even have birthdays? Well, no matter, a party it is!",""
"115740052-0-11369","The ones who once served you now serve me, Jorunn!",""
"115740052-0-11370","They've got Kireth too! She's in the tent behind the dragon mound.",""
"115740052-0-11371","Poor Borodor. He shouldn't have died this way.",""

"115740052-0-12514","Our guest and I will recover the Amulet. The rest of you will stop more Daedra from entering the tombs.",""
"115740052-0-12515","What about the undead? The Daedra undoubtedly stirred them up.",""
"115740052-0-12516","We'll have to fight them both. There is no other choice.",""
"115740052-0-12517","Hold the line, Dragonguard.",""

"115740052-0-12529","Good, the lock is holding. Speak with me, I'll explain what must be done.",""
"115740052-0-12530","We may never know what happened to us, but at least we are no longer lost in a fog of mead and enchantment.",""

"115740052-0-12544","They did not delay you long enough! I shall dispatch you and claim the Amulet!",""
"115740052-0-12545","We're almost there. I can feel the power in the air.",""

"115740052-0-12551","The Great Hall is barred at the entrance to the Frost Steps. There must be a trick to opening the gate. Dare I go further? Will I ever return?",""
"115740052-0-12552","I am! I am a Rilis!",""
"115740052-0-12553","Take it, then. And see what it means to be a Rilis.",""
"115740052-0-12554","At last. My birthright!",""
"115740052-0-12555","Lucas hid the chests with magic. We'll need to find and burn the sacred incense in the braziers below to make them appear.",""

"115740052-0-12557","Stand back. And behold the scion of Castle Rilis!",""
"115740052-0-12558","I've traveled here for naught. The gate to the crypt is locked, probably opened by the pair of pressure plates here. And me with no companion.nnWithout the Torch, I can't light the Flame. Regrettable, but I'll return. I've yet to explore the summit.",""
"115740052-0-12559","What? What's happening to me?",""
"115740052-0-12560","Fall back to the crypt! Move!",""

"115740052-0-12563","I'm sorry, sir. There were just too many. We fought in retreat to reach you here.",""
"115740052-0-12564","Very well. You'll come back with us to protect it. Catch your breath, we move out momentarily.",""
"115740052-0-12565","What's happening to me? Help me! Help! I am. A Rilis!",""

"115740052-0-12573","I pose to you, scale-scholar: what is the Hist?",""
"115740052-0-12574","The trees themselves, of course. The ground beneath our feet? The water that flows down the river? The breath of a new eggling?",""
"115740052-0-12575","All are correct. The Hist flows from the sap to our veins, and connects everything in between.",""
"115740052-0-12576","Mother. I'm sorry.",""
"115740052-0-12577","Your intrusion shall be punished.",""

"115740052-0-12583","Wait! I'm right behind you! Let me get the door.",""
"115740052-0-12584","A locked door! Like fools, we assumed that meant there was something valuable inside. Just another facet of the trap, I guess.",""

"115740052-0-12881","Your work is done, penitent. Go to the center of Torinaan. End this corruption.",""
"115740052-0-12882","Any sign of those slavers?",""
"115740052-0-12883","No, they've been quiet on this side. Haven't made a move.",""
"115740052-0-12884","Well, be ready. They're desperate in there.",""
"115740052-0-12885","Do what you can there. Firsthold already burns beneath my gaze.",""

"115740052-0-12889","By Sheor's beard … it's a massacre in here!",""
"115740052-0-12890","It is good work. If you want to make a stew, you must gut a few fish, no?",""
"115740052-0-12891","Now come! Let us undo this altar.",""
"115740052-0-12892","This one still feels a magic presence. There must be another altar.",""
"115740052-0-12893","So. Oraneth sold her soul completely. The Thalmor will not be happy with this.",""
"115740052-0-12894","Bakkhara, look! Just as you feared - the ritual is complete. See how the darkness gathers?",""

"115740052-0-12897","No, damnit. It's getting on my nerves.",""
"115740052-0-12898","It's quiet on the other side. Still nothing here?",""
"115740052-0-12899","Don't I know it. Somebody better do something soon.",""
"115740052-0-12900","Deputy seemed pretty edgy. I think something is going to happen soon.",""

"115740052-0-12921","What?",""
"115740052-0-12922","How many times do I have to tell you not to rewrite Nerien'eth's texts? It's incredibly irritating. And insulting.",""
"115740052-0-12923","His books are wrong. All of this is pointless conjecture. You lot should be paying me to fix his work. The incoming classes will benefit greatly from my edits.",""
"115740052-0-12924","By the Empyrean Light! The Altmeri do not openly criticize their elders! Were you conceived by Orcs? What's wrong with you?",""
"115740052-0-12925","I might as well be an Orc, the way my parents shipped me off to you. But you know that, don't you, Alanwe? You're all such lovely Elves.",""
"115740052-0-12926","I … apologize. Put the books back where you found them, and I shall leave it at that. You have talent, Faindor. Don't waste it showing off. If you think you can do better, prove it to us, when the time comes.",""
"115740052-0-12927","Please, have you read this garbage? Your husband knows nothing about conjuration. What does he even teach here? What is his purpose? Besides paying for this building? He's an insult to your kind. Your kind meaning mages. All the mages. In the world.",""
"115740052-0-12928","An unusual bargaining session, but I'd best go check my stock.",""
"115740052-0-12929","Give me those shoes or I beat you to death and take them! Choose!",""

"115740052-0-12944","Combine the juices and the spines just so!",""
"115740052-0-12945","Now, according to my previous notes, I need a small catalyst.",""
"115740052-0-12946","Isn't it grand! Wait, what's that burning smell ….",""
"115740052-0-12948","For pity's sake, get me out of here!",""
"115740052-0-12949","Then arise as Svari, Sage of the Companions of Fallowstone Hall!",""
"115740052-0-12951","If you minded your own business, I wouldn't have to stab you.",""
"115740052-0-12952","Wait! What are you doing? What is happening?",""
"115740052-0-12953","You miserable waste of matter! Stop them! Your essence is forfeit if you fail!",""

"115740052-0-12963","Now! Destroy the crystals!",""
"115740052-0-12964","Good. Now to examine … the body?",""
"115740052-0-12965","Yes. Whatever Oraneth unleashed here may be even stronger than she. Prepare yourselves.",""
"115740052-0-12966","Let this evil be undone!",""
"115740052-0-12967","Everybody out! Oraneth would undo us all!",""
"115740052-0-12968","You, go! Bakkhara can only hold this back for so long.",""
"115740052-0-12969","Everybody out! Oraneth would undo us all!",""
"115740052-0-12970","It's quiet out there …",""
"115740052-0-12971","Don't. You say it again, I'll kill you.",""
"115740052-0-12972","Really? Squashed him flat?",""
"115740052-0-12973","Yep. The giant walked off with Dagimar's head between his toes. Bet that caused a blister after a mile or so.",""
"115740052-0-12974","Figures they'd send you. Die, goblin-lover!",""
"115740052-0-12975","Mistress Bakkhara, what are you doing? We must go!",""
"115740052-0-12976","No, you must go! Warn the Guild. Warn Tamriel! Quickly now - Bakkhara can't hold this forever.",""
"115740052-0-12977","What in Oblivion was that?",""
"115740052-0-12978","Are you coming?",""
"115740052-0-12979","Thank you! I'll try to make it back to Trelan.",""
"115740052-0-12980","Let's see if Trelan's party has gotten any better.",""
"115740052-0-12981","<<1>>! Thank the gods you're alive!",""
"115740052-0-12982","The fog has lifted, Vestige. The path before us has been revealed. It is both dark, and twisted. nnCome to the Harborage. We have an unexpected guest who demands your presence.",""
"115740052-0-12983","These interruptions are becoming — ah. I see. I see …",""
"115740052-0-12984","… inherent fallacy. Clearly magic obtains its strength and form from nature, as proposed by …",""
"115740052-0-12985","Nonsense! Magic underlies and defines nature. Nature is merely the manifestation of the mundane aspect of magic.",""
"115740052-0-12986","And the powers we employ in our spellcraft?",""
"115740052-0-12987","That's the arcane aspect of magic, the hidden elements we draw upon.",""
"115740052-0-12988","Your mind works in amusing ways, Danir. Perhaps more research is needed.",""
"115740052-0-12989","<<1>>! You're safe!",""
"115740052-0-12990","Yes, I'm fine, but you're not. Please sit down, rest.",""
"115740052-0-12991","Keeper! I found something!",""
"115740052-0-12992","Have you put in at Vulkhel Guard recently?",""
"115740052-0-12993","I know! The tariffs are killing us. That witch of a watch captain is pocketing the money, mark my words.",""
"115740052-0-12994","I heard she was arrested in some kind of scandal. The Green take her.",""
"115740052-0-12995","A friend of mine is setting up a trading concern in Vulkwasten. He asked me what kind of meat Wood Elves like.",""
"115740052-0-12996","Err. Uh. I'm going to say boar. And fish. We love fish.",""
"115740052-0-12997","Okay. I'll let him know. I say you shortfolk are strange.",""
"115740052-0-12998","When's the next time your people are heading to the mainland?",""
"115740052-0-12999","There's some kind of event in Dune coming up. I was hoping to put in at Velyn Harbor sometime next month.",""
"115740052-0-13000","Ah. I feel that ache. The caravan overland is so tedious. Damn that river. If we could put in at Arenthia, think of the time we could save!",""
"115740052-0-13001","You're on your own today. I'm not going near those docks.",""
"115740052-0-13002","Oh come now. Zombies in the water?",""
"115740052-0-13003","I saw one! Pale skin, dead eyes, clawing at my boat. I speared it and rowed back as fast as I could.",""
"115740052-0-13004","That's nonsense. Zombies don't swim.",""
"115740052-0-13005","Neither will you, if one grabs you.",""
"115740052-0-13006","What a beautiful day for fishing! Get up, you lazy oaf.",""
"115740052-0-13007","Did you hear? Thane Fjora was attacked by one of her councilors!",""
"115740052-0-13008","I bet it was Golun.",""
"115740052-0-13009","Why him?",""
"115740052-0-13010","Oh? And what of the water zombies?",""
"115740052-0-13011","Now for the true test! I've tamed the most exotic and dangerous beasts from the dark corners of Tamriel to test these challengers!",""
"115740052-0-13012","They're gone. One of the Skald King's best uncovered Worm Cult on the docks. Wiped them out!",""
"115740052-0-13013","There were Worm Cultists? Here?",""
"115740052-0-13014","The first monstrosities—presented for your entertainment—come from the ashlands of Morrowind. These creatures laid waste to an entire village before I captured them!",""
"115740052-0-13015","And you thought I was crazy.",""
"115740052-0-13016","He's got the shifty eyes. And his name sounds evil. Who names their kid Golun?",""
"115740052-0-13017","Without further ado, it is my great honor to present… a magically corrupted strain of Shalk. I call them… Incineration Beetles!",""
"115740052-0-13018","What a night! I can't believe what's going on around here. Soldiers all over.",""
"115740052-0-13019","This is the Companions' fault. Never liked them hanging around town like that anyway.",""
"115740052-0-13020","I don't know about that, but the Reachmen sure want something in that mine.",""
"115740052-0-13021","Well, how do you like being part of the Pact now? They cleaned things up, eh?",""
"115740052-0-13022","What? Town's a mess, Sinmur's back, Fallowstone's overrun. Don't need friends like that.",""
"115740052-0-13023","Come on, the Pact helped us out of a jam. I'm happy to have allies like that.",""
"115740052-0-13024","Sergeant Aera was a Worm Cultist!",""
"115740052-0-13025","I don't believe it. Fjora said Aera saved her life. She's a hero!",""
"115740052-0-13026","Someone saw Aera run into the crypt.",""
"115740052-0-13027","So what? I bet she was chasing Worm Cultists, killing the last of them.",""
"115740052-0-13028","You're heading to Lost Prospect? Skip it.",""
"115740052-0-13029","Why?",""
"115740052-0-13030","Nobody who goes there ever comes back. It's crawling with zombies.",""
"115740052-0-13031","Bah, just rumors. If that was true, the Watch'd take care of it.",""
"115740052-0-13032","The Watch has bigger problems. Like that giant. I'd avoid Lost Prospect, if I was you.",""
"115740052-0-13033","You heard about Lost Prospect? I told you!",""
"115740052-0-13034","You told me what?",""
"115740052-0-13035","Viveka just got back from there. Killed a lich and lots of zombies!",""
"115740052-0-13036","Shor's Blood! What happened? How did she survive?",""
"115740052-0-13037","One of Jorunn's soldiers saved her. Killed the lich and the zombies too. Damn fine work!",""
"115740052-0-13038","It is a trap!",""
"115740052-0-13039","Aye, it's safer here, but I miss Fullhelm. And that hardass Ironhand.",""
"115740052-0-13040","What about old Wandering Eye?",""
"115740052-0-13041","Ha! Thorulf was an odd duck for sure. He'd stare out that window for hours.",""
"115740052-0-13042","Ugh! Creepy. And the way he looked at Mistress Hallfrida was just, well … obscene.",""
"115740052-0-13043","Don't worry about Hallfrida. Any man lays a hand on her will get a dagger in his belly.",""
"115740052-0-13044","Guldir! Wait 'til you hear. Thorulf was with the Worm Cult!",""
"115740052-0-13045","No! You're not serious. Is he dead?",""
"115740052-0-13046","He got away. Tricked the Thane into trying to kill himself. Old Ironhand's still alive, though.",""
"115740052-0-13047","Thank Dibella! How was he saved?",""
"115740052-0-13048","The Skald King's bodyguard saved Ironhand and the whole fort, from an army of undead no less!",""
"115740052-0-13049","Guldir! Wait 'til you hear. Thorulf was with the Worm Cult!",""
"115740052-0-13050","No! Old Wandering Eye? Did they kill him?",""
"115740052-0-13051","The Thane's bodyguard got him. Bless them for that. But Old Ironhand's dead.",""
"115740052-0-13052","No! What happened?",""
"115740052-0-13053","Thorulf tricked him into burning himself alive. Hallfrida's Thane now. If not for that bodyguard, they'd all be dead.",""
"115740052-0-13054","Where are the Three when you need them most? Nowhere!",""
"115740052-0-13055","Keep your voice down, Belera. The Hands of Almalexia don't tolerate blasphemy.",""
"115740052-0-13056","But we have to tolerate indifference? Where's the justice in that?",""
"115740052-0-13058","I heard the Reachmen are up in the mountains, and maybe at Fallowstone Hall too",""
"115740052-0-13059","Really? Then why is Vigrod here? Shouldn't he be at the Hall?",""
"115740052-0-13060","No idea. It's just a rumor. Like the one about Reachmen with trained bears up in the mountains.",""
"115740052-0-13061","Did you hear about Fallowstone Hall? Vigrod and someone from the Pact took it back!",""
"115740052-0-13062","That's a relief. Don't know why Vigrod left the Hall in the first place.",""
"115740052-0-13063","He's always looked after Shor's. Knowing Vigrod, he's taking the losses at the Hall pretty hard.",""
"115740052-0-13064","This looks promising. Let's start searching!",""
"115740052-0-13065","Wicked thieves! This one fairly stole these gems!",""
"115740052-0-13066","The lovely elf-woman will be unable to resist me now!",""
"115740052-0-13067","We can't let him get away!",""
"115740052-0-13068","You are as slow as you are ugly!",""
"115740052-0-13069","We have to catch him!",""
"115740052-0-13070","You first!",""
"115740052-0-13071","Follow if you dare, tiny elf-man!",""
"115740052-0-13072","He's gone through the gate! Hurry!",""
"115740052-0-13073","Eat the beans! The beans!",""
"115740052-0-13074","No! I mustn't! Y'ffre, protect me from these loathsome legumes!",""
"115740052-0-13075","These challengers are surpisingly fierce! But here's the real reason you've come today!",""
"115740052-0-13076","I give you the most dangerous creature the wastes of Alik'r have ever spawned!",""
"115740052-0-13077","Thank you. Had I eaten that mess, I wouldn't have broken the Pact, but they surely would have killed me.",""
"115740052-0-13078","Prepare yourself, combatants! Pray to your gods and make your peace. You face the Stinger!",""
"115740052-0-13079","What? Impossible? How did you win?",""
"115740052-0-13080","Stop the vestige at all costs! Soldiers, fall in!","Fermate il vestigio ad ogni costo! Soldati, schieratevi!"
"115740052-0-13081","Please, help me!",""
"115740052-0-13082","From the volcanic island of Vvardenfell. A creature of fury that knows no mercy. The vicious … the cruel … the Troll King!",""
"115740052-0-13083","The door is there, to the west.",""
"115740052-0-13084","I can't believe all this horrible talk about the Maulborn.",""
"115740052-0-13085","They do seem to be completely devoted to their cause.",""
"115740052-0-13086","Yes, but their cause is evil! What don't you understand about that?",""
"115740052-0-13087","The price you're asking is outrageous.",""
"115740052-0-13088","Don't want to pay? That's fine, I'm sure I can find someone who'll meet my price over in Skywatch.",""
"115740052-0-13089","The Green take you. I won't have those upland upstarts outselling me. Your price is met.",""
"115740052-0-13090","This way!",""
"115740052-0-13091","So what do your people value? I'm thinking of seeking trading partners in Vulkwasten.",""
"115740052-0-13092","Well. Don't bother with booze. Most Bosmer don't imbibe. Meat. They always need more meat.",""
"115740052-0-13093","I sunk some coin into a farm a few years back. I'll have to speak with my man in Greenwater.",""
"115740052-0-13094","The quality of the steel from Mathiisen is excellent. Have you seen the blades they're making up there?",""
"115740052-0-13095","Oh yes. I've got an in with the foreman. Getting some for a great price.",""
"115740052-0-13096","Bah. Damn you tallies and your nepotism. I need a stepstool to get a fair deal around here.",""
"115740052-0-13097","You no take mammoth!",""
"115740052-0-13098","I say, did you see that Khajiit scum near the temple grounds? Disgusting, letting a mongrel near the house of Auri-El.",""
"115740052-0-13099","I quite agree. Too bad they put in the hunting ban. Our fathers had quite the time, eh?",""
"115740052-0-13100","Just so! And well put, sir, well put.",""
"115740052-0-13101","The stink. That's the worst part.",""
"115740052-0-13102","You know what, you're right. At first I thought those nasty little teeth were the worst part. But the smell! Ugh.",""
"115740052-0-13103","Comes of eating all that meat. What normal folk could stomach - ugh. What normal folk could stomach a meat drink?",""
"115740052-0-13104","Why would you ever go to that horrible little backwater?",""
"115740052-0-13105","I'm telling you, the beasts of Shattered Grove come right up to you. Bears eat right out of your hand!",""
"115740052-0-13106","Amazing. Can't wait to try out the blade father gave me. Good Mathiisen steel against bearflesh!",""
"115740052-0-13107","I would sooner die than harm Y'ffre's blessed wood!",""
"115740052-0-13108","You will chop this tree or die!",""
"115740052-0-13111","Please, you must stop these bastards. They spoke of raising an Ehlnofey.",""
"115740052-0-13112","They hope to shatter Y'ffre's Blessing! Please, you must stop them!",""
"115740052-0-13113","Lyris, child. Are you all right?",""
"115740052-0-13114","Yes, Prophet. I'm fine. The Vestige freed my mind from the Daedra's control.",""
"115740052-0-13115","Thank the Divines. Your loss would have thrown all into chaos.",""
"115740052-0-13116","They won't take me again. Not alive, at least.",""
"115740052-0-13117","Sorry, but I can't be caught or killed. Good luck!",""
"115740052-0-13118","Take up the torch and burn the tree!",""
"115740052-0-13119","I will protect the Green with my life! I will not break the Pact!",""
"115740052-0-13121","There! Get them!",""
"115740052-0-13122","About time! Help me kill this one and let's get out of here!",""
"115740052-0-13123","Was he there, child? Was Mannimarco present at the Castle?",""
"115740052-0-13124","No, the runt wasn't there from what I could tell. Then again, I was just guarding the door.",""
"115740052-0-13125","That is good. We are not ready for such a confrontation. The King of Worms would have destroyed you both.",""
"115740052-0-13126","You're playing this too cautiously, sir. Should've brought in a trebuchet with us.",""
"115740052-0-13127","You know very well that is not in my power. Rest now, Lyris. Let me see to your wounds.",""
"115740052-0-13128","Stop! You two—hold it right there!",""
"115740052-0-13129","The Reachmen talked of an ancient tomb down here, something about the Companions.",""
"115740052-0-13130","I heard the shamans talk of ""Sinmur,"" some ancient creature, evil I'd guess.",""
"115740052-0-13131","I need to get out of here. Those shamans are looking for some long-dead monster!",""
"115740052-0-13132","Get out of here, mage! You're ruining the play. The villains are about to take the stage.",""
"115740052-0-13133","The shamans found a tomb deep in the mine. I'm not staying around to see what they're up to!",""
"115740052-0-13134","Dark powers gather ahead.",""
"115740052-0-13135","Reach shamans seek Sinmur, an ancient foe of the Companions.",""
"115740052-0-13136","I sense the spirit of Sinmur drawing near!",""
"115740052-0-13137","If Sinmur walks again, death and devastation will stalk the land!",""
"115740052-0-13138","We have a challenger! Let's welcome them to the party!",""
"115740052-0-13139","Who dares disturb the rest of <<1>>?",""
"115740052-0-13140","What is this, amateur hour? Begone, mage!",""
"115740052-0-13141","Awaken, thralls! Destroy these tomb robbers!",""
"115740052-0-13142","I am <<1>>! Meet your doom!",""
"115740052-0-13143","Stupid mage. He's trying to upstage you! Time to bring down the house. Break a leg. And a covenant.",""
"115740052-0-13144","Fitting, only the gods can save you now!",""
"115740052-0-13145","I'm getting out of here!",""
"115740052-0-13146","They've taken Tovisa and the rest into the mine!",""
"115740052-0-13147","Just a little bit further.",""
"115740052-0-13148","Not one step further! For the Empire!",""
"115740052-0-13149","It will be over soon.",""
"115740052-0-13150","I can help.",""
"115740052-0-13151","No, don't!",""
"115740052-0-13154","Damn! Discovered!",""
"115740052-0-13155","Now we'll see what the Mad God has in store. Be brave, adept.",""
"115740052-0-13157","Ha ha!",""
"115740052-0-13159","Ho, friend!",""
"115740052-0-13160","After you.",""
"115740052-0-13161","I am an Oathbreaker, you fool! Did you think the Cult would not have a plan? Dringoth will rise, and soon your corpse will join us.",""
"115740052-0-13162","No! No hit in face! Byz sweep!",""
"115740052-0-13163","By the Three, we will rebuild, dear. We will rebuild.",""
"115740052-0-13164","The Dominion took everything from us. I'll kill them. I'll kill them all.",""
"115740052-0-13165","I'll kill them. I'll kill them all.",""
"115740052-0-13166","Get away from here! I don't want to be let out!",""
"115740052-0-13167","Mother! You left me …. I'm all alone.",""
"115740052-0-13168","The other students, the other mages, they all hate me.",""
"115740052-0-13169","You were the only one ….",""
"115740052-0-13170","And now you're gone.",""
"115740052-0-13171","You didn't come home last night. I waited all night for you. Have you been working this entire time?",""
"115740052-0-13172","Shalidor! Eyevea is lost … you're obsessed! Can you even hear me?",""
"115740052-0-13173","I can't do this anymore. You love your spells and scrolls more than you love me. I'm leaving you. Can you hear me now?",""
"115740052-0-13174","Goodbye … you stupid old fool.",""
"115740052-0-13175","Ulfie … my love? I swear I just heard you. Where did you go?",""
"115740052-0-13176","Let's see here ….",""
"115740052-0-13177","It works! I knew it would, of course.",""
"115740052-0-13178","Into the tunnel you go. Now to get that door open!",""
"115740052-0-13179","At long last—Bthzark! Come, we'll talk of our next move inside.",""
"115740052-0-13180","A happy side effect of restoring the power is that I can get this door open for you. There! That should do it!",""
"115740052-0-13181","These writings could prove crucial to understanding the schematics.",""
"115740052-0-13182","That should do it! Remember, we're looking for both the schematics for the device and the core that can power it!",""
"115740052-0-13183","My love. Must I wait forever?",""
"115740052-0-13184","Why won't you come to me, my love?",""
"115740052-0-13185","If you so much as squawk, I will fill you full of arrows.",""
"115740052-0-13186","I think that's the text we're looking for!",""
"115740052-0-13187","Byz go tell chief you want talk.",""
"115740052-0-13188","One less Goblin to deal with.",""
"115740052-0-13189","You dare steal from me? Krif voth ahkrin!",""
"115740052-0-13190","Ah. Korthor's awake.",""
"115740052-0-13191","My priests will make quick work of you! Luft Dinokii!",""
"115740052-0-13192","The shadows move, adept. Watch yourself!",""
"115740052-0-13193","Wait! I don't wish to fight. Let us talk.",""
"115740052-0-13194","Eyes to the sky! Another group!",""
"115740052-0-13195","Good luck!",""
"115740052-0-13196","Curse it, I know he left some money in here.",""
"115740052-0-13197","Found it! Time to get drinking!",""
"115740052-0-13198","That fool better have saved some for me!",""
"115740052-0-13199","Congratulations. You've passed the first trial.",""
"115740052-0-13200","To arms!",""
"115740052-0-13201","Yeah, they bested the finest sloths, drunkards, and fools we had to offer!",""
"115740052-0-13202","Adorable. Shall we give them a pendant?",""
"115740052-0-13203","I say, let's see how these soft skins fair against a real challenge!",""
"115740052-0-13204","Thank the Eight it's quiet today. Did you hear what happened to Dame Dabienne in Koeglin Village?",""
"115740052-0-13205","She said some stranger showed up and got her set loose. She was lucky. You don't find people like that every day.",""
"115740052-0-13206","I have a big nose.",""
"115740052-0-13207","It's good to know the war hasn't taken all the heroes from this world. Gives me some hope we'll get through this.",""
"115740052-0-13208","Enough of this! Now you shall die!",""
"115740052-0-13209","Stop!",""
"115740052-0-13210","An enchanted saddle-warmer? You're too generous, Sir Brice. I don't go riding often these days, but I do appreciate the gesture.",""
"115740052-0-13211","Fools! You cannot stand against the might of Molag Bal!",""
"115740052-0-13212","The Eye may be fragile. Please let me examine it.",""
"115740052-0-13213","Cease your meddling, mortal. The Master has plans for the Redguard.",""
"115740052-0-13214","You make it hard to resist your advances, but I don't want to rush into anything.",""
"115740052-0-13215","Quite the little fighter. We're not done with you yet!",""
"115740052-0-13216","Indeed I would, Yarelion … if that were truly the case. I'm afraid you gentlemen will have to excuse me now.",""
"115740052-0-13217","Hah! You're too late! I've found him. The Redguard is mine!",""
"115740052-0-13218","My master has plans for your pure soul, Merric. You should feel honored.",""
"115740052-0-13219","Welcome to the fight, comrade. Claws out, and watch yourself!",""
"115740052-0-13220","More coming. Brace yourself!",""
"115740052-0-13221","What was that voice?",""
"115740052-0-13222","So does that mean you will consider my request for your hand?",""
"115740052-0-13223","Perhaps you should tell him the truth, Ilise. That you and I plan to sell the estate and elope to Summerset Isle!",""
"115740052-0-13224","I had an awful battle with some monsters over this way.",""
"115740052-0-13225","Go on without me. I … uh … have to do something over here.",""
"115740052-0-13226","Well, here we go. Please stay close!",""
"115740052-0-13227","Now let's see if this works. It sure stinks!",""
"115740052-0-13228","I found this in Skyrim, at the bottom of a lake.",""
"115740052-0-13229","Here goes!",""
"115740052-0-13230","Is it working?",""
"115740052-0-13231","It took so long before I found Belarata. Well! Let's begin.",""
"115740052-0-13232","What's that noise?",""
"115740052-0-13233","There it is! Good luck!",""
"115740052-0-13234","""Our fates through the years are tied. A lovers' kiss? Not one denied.""",""
"115740052-0-13235","""Our hearts awoke from blissful sleep, where battles break and maidens weep.""",""
"115740052-0-13236","""Away to war, not long to part, with sword enchanted by his sweet heart.""",""
"115740052-0-13237","""A lover's bond forever more, to keep each lover's heart in store.""",""
"115740052-0-13238","Too sweet, even for me, but what can you do, yes?",""
"115740052-0-13239","Who? What happened here?",""
"115740052-0-13240","Something terrible issues from the ruins! The Bloodthorns have released an Ayleid horror.",""
"115740052-0-13241","Come, she waits.",""
"115740052-0-13242","A sword with a poem etched into it. Also, the name ""Belarata.""",""
"115740052-0-13243","I'm off to Deepwoods! Wish me luck!",""
"115740052-0-13244","I'm his now! Beware when next we meet!",""
"115740052-0-13245","There's too much power! I can't contain it!",""
"115740052-0-13246","The Keep has been abandoned for ages, sealed by unyielding frost—the locals say that it is haunted. Despite this, I hope to reclaim my ancestral home.nnShould ill-fortune befall me, I have left these Speaking Stones behind to tell my tale.",""
"115740052-0-13247","The Keep has been abandoned for a generation, its entrances sealed by decades of accumulated layers of ice.  The locals keep away, frightened by stories of a witch's curse on the Direfrost family.",""
"115740052-0-13248","There is an undeniable presence here, and dread consumes me. Despite my fear, I cannot help but investigate. Should ill-fortune befall me and I do not survive, I have left these Speaking Stones behind to tell my tale. I will start in the Main Hall.",""
"115740052-0-13249","It looks clear now! Hurry. Meet me back at the manse!",""
"115740052-0-13250","By the Green, I could use a drink. Smell that fresh brew!",""
"115740052-0-13251","Stendarr. My head!",""
"115740052-0-13252","Giant snakes? Ahhh!",""
"115740052-0-13253","Here they come!",""
"115740052-0-13256","Is… is this the way out?",""
"115740052-0-13257","Netches are worse than kwama! Oh, what have I done?",""
"115740052-0-13258","Hold a moment. We should speak.",""
"115740052-0-13259","Everyone! Gather around the fire. Our visitor has introduced me to a new delicacy. This one thinks it will be a most fragrant experience.",""
"115740052-0-13260","This door bears a threefold seal. All of the runes must be found and activated to open it.",""
"115740052-0-13261","Ysanne, why are you here? I don't think gawking at that knight is such a good idea.",""
"115740052-0-13262","What do you mean, not a good idea? You expect me to show pity for someone who's working with slavers?",""
"115740052-0-13263","You really believe that? She's a Knight of the Flame. There's no way she was working with the slavers.",""
"115740052-0-13264","Then why'd the constable have her locked up? You don't have an answer for that, do you?",""
"115740052-0-13265","I don't understand the constable's reasoning, but I have enough sense to realize that something's not right here.",""
"115740052-0-13266","Do you still seek to free us with Sirdor's Stone? We already told you—we don't need your kindness. It comes ages too late. And if you think we won't flay you when we're free—we believe sharp laughter is the way your kind would respond.",""
"115740052-0-13267","This is … unpleasant. Our mind feels … pulled apart ….",""
"115740052-0-13268","This light … reminds us of the sun.",""
"115740052-0-13269","You will die as Sirdor did, and we will drink you, as well.",""
"115740052-0-13270","I have returned, my love!",""
"115740052-0-13271","<<1>>, we've got a new ally here!",""
"115740052-0-13272","My love? I cannot … your sword! Where is ….",""
"115740052-0-13273","A pure soul, Doshia. Don't fail me.",""
"115740052-0-13274","Kyne, give me strength.",""
"115740052-0-13275","Agh. Aaaaaaaagh!",""
"115740052-0-13276","I can't wait to see my family.",""
"115740052-0-13277","Noooo! Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh!",""
"115740052-0-13278","You lied? Stay away from me!",""
"115740052-0-13279","You are tired! Let me come closer!",""
"115740052-0-13280","You are not <<1>>! Get back!",""
"115740052-0-13281","Augh!",""
"115740052-0-13282","My friend, no! What are you doing?",""
"115740052-0-13283","My head! I need a moment.",""
"115740052-0-13284","B'vek, I'll have my revenge.",""
"115740052-0-13285","Your revenge, your silk was worthless. Mine was the finest quality.",""
"115740052-0-13286","Did an Ashlander tell you that?",""
"115740052-0-13287","I hate your face!",""
"115740052-0-13288","<<1>>, at long last I return!",""
"115740052-0-13289","<<1>>! You have been gone only a day, but it feels like an age.",""
"115740052-0-13290","Yes, true. But you … where have you been?",""
"115740052-0-13291","Each day is an age without you.",""
"115740052-0-13292","It is a long story, but come! Aetherius awaits!",""
"115740052-0-13293","Yes, together forever, as was always meant to be.",""
"115740052-0-13294","So long, my friend, and thank you. For everything!",""
"115740052-0-13295","Ha! Durak. You say we betrayed you, but the Spirit Wardens and the Midnight Union were never allies.",""
"115740052-0-13296","Indeed. We serve two very different mistresses. Our dream is your nightmare. Welcome to the new world, Abbot!",""
"115740052-0-13297","How's he doing?",""
"115740052-0-13298","He'll live, but he won't be swinging a sword anytime soon.",""
"115740052-0-13299","Stay with him. We may need to move fast if they attack again.",""
"115740052-0-13300","You never forget that smell. A Dragon Priest's tomb.",""
"115740052-0-13301","A frost barrier. Look for a way to bring it down.",""
"115740052-0-13302","Worthless!",""
"115740052-0-13303","Now, let's see if I can dislodge this.",""
"115740052-0-13304","Something's … happening.",""
"115740052-0-13305","Fire and brimstone!",""
"115740052-0-13306","Agrakh will be pleased with your head!",""
"115740052-0-13307","Ah, you've won this round!",""
"115740052-0-13308","This doesn't seem right ….",""
"115740052-0-13309","Ahh, my favorite mortal. Shalidor finally figured out how to let you in. You're here to kick me out, I know. But fighting isn't really my thing. Haskill?",""
"115740052-0-13310","Very good, sir. Ahem. Have at you, adept. We will now face each other in honorable combat. On your guard.",""
"115740052-0-13311","Exactly. Now, say goodbye to the nice mortals, Haskill.",""
"115740052-0-13312","Just remember to point the wand away from you, dearie!",""

"115740052-0-13377","Gather your forces, Skald King, and champions like those here today. The hardest task awaits. The Worms are servants of a more sinister force.",""
"115740052-0-13378","Coldharbour beckons. The veil grows thin. You must convene a great moot in Mournhold, Skald King. You have an invasion to plan.",""
"115740052-0-13379","For the Pact and the north!",""

"115740052-0-13388","Get away from my things!",""
"115740052-0-13389","Not so fast there, Shalidor. Only invited guests at the Chateau. We have standards, you know.",""

"115740052-0-13397","Very well then. Now you will face us.",""
"115740052-0-13398","I've known this clan for years. We've never been allies, but this hostility is unexpected.",""
"115740052-0-13399","This one thanks you, stranger. Please, come to meet in the storehouse!",""
"115740052-0-13400","Thanks to you, young one. I will find my own escape now.",""

"115740052-0-13436","Well, I'm the only House Dres courier who delivers wine in Mournhold, so that bottle must have come from my supply. And it certainly looks good next to you. You mentioned gratitude. How thankful exactly are you thinking?",""

"115740052-0-13559","What? It's true. Lord Mannimarco is going to peel his skin off and make a particularly ugly flesh atronach out of him, mark my words.",""

"115740052-0-13625","Go, join the fracas! This is your cue. Action!",""
"115740052-0-13626","Employing dead Ayleids as the mechanism to unbar this door is actually quite clever.",""
"115740052-0-13627","Oh yeah! Get em'!",""
"115740052-0-13628","I'm getting out of here!",""
"115740052-0-13629","No matter. Come. Face me yourselves!",""

"115740052-0-13637","What's the plan?",""
"115740052-0-13638","Vardan is in the spirit realm, beyond the portal. He has the relic, and we must get it!",""

"115740052-0-13648","That bastard!",""
"115740052-0-13649","That is one. Now let's head to the next site.",""
"115740052-0-13650","We've done it, dearie! Follow me, it's time you were introduced to the Dance!",""
"115740052-0-13651","Only one remains.",""
"115740052-0-13652","I hope we don't run into any werewolves again. I've had enough of those beasts.",""
"115740052-0-13653","The archery range is just up this hill.",""
"115740052-0-13654","What is going on up here? Merric?",""
"115740052-0-13655","Good luck, have fun!",""
"115740052-0-13656","Hurry! Take that to the hill. The first fires will be lit soon.",""
"115740052-0-13657","This should seal Fort Grimwatch for now.",""
"115740052-0-13658","So you decided the fate of the relic.",""
"115740052-0-13659","Time for me to seek new adventures… farewell.",""

"115740052-0-13661","The first Mane? Incredible!",""
"115740052-0-13662","My parent's graves. My mother died in childbirth.",""
"115740052-0-13663","My father was distant. Cold. I think he blamed me for my mother's death.",""
"115740052-0-13664","I ran off to become a mercenary when I was sixteen. I never saw my father again. He was murdered by an old enemy.",""

"115740052-0-13743","The marketplace. The crafters. The Mages Guild! The three-story chironasium! I've never been to a city this big before!",""
"115740052-0-13744","Then I know you'll enjoy your stay … if you stay out of dark alleys. And away from the docks. And near crowds. I'm sure you'll be perfectly fine!",""
"115740052-0-13745","Oh, yes. I'll have to hire a security staff, I think. We don't want any more surprise necromancers. Now go back to your body. I'll figure out what to do with you later.",""
"115740052-0-13746","This is worse than Oblivion.",""
"115740052-0-13747","I'm heading to the Wyress' camp site!",""
"115740052-0-13748","Prophet, Mannimarco captured Sai Sahan! He's torturing him to find out where the Amulet of Kings is hidden. We have to rescue him!",""
"115740052-0-13749","And where are you going in such a hurry, hero?",""
"115740052-0-13750","We'll meet you at the beacons! See you there, Hallowed.",""
"115740052-0-13751","Well, let's go see what's happening at <<1>>'s party. Can't be any deader than this.",""
"115740052-0-13752","I'm grateful for your help. I'll  head to the camp of the Wyresses shortly. You can find me there.",""
"115740052-0-13753","So. The schematics were here. Someone took them.",""
"115740052-0-13754","I doubt they escaped.",""
"115740052-0-13755","My brother should be able to decipher these. Interesting.",""
"115740052-0-13756","Continue looking for the schematics. I'll meet up with you shortly.",""
"115740052-0-13757","We're holding them for the moment. Herdor, are we ready to move?",""
"115740052-0-13758","Almost, sir. Gloo needs more time to prepare. And the villagers are still on the run.",""
"115740052-0-13759","I'd tell her to work faster, but her eyebrows are still regrowing. Damn. We need more options.",""
"115740052-0-13760","Sai! What's happened to you? What have they done?",""
"115740052-0-13761","Lyris, you saucy wench! How long has it been, eh? Have a drink with old Noggy!",""
"115740052-0-13762","Lyris! Lyris, I can see you! Are you really there?",""
"115740052-0-13763","Bah! Don't listen to this Redguard bastard. He wouldn't know a good time if it walked up and introduced itself!",""
"115740052-0-13764","Sai, you need to hold on. We're going to find you. I'll make sure of it.",""
"115740052-0-13765","<<1>>! What happened?",""
"115740052-0-13766","I must get the schematics to my workshop. Join me if you wish to return to town.nnCome, Clanker.",""
"115740052-0-13767","That thing was stronger than it looked. I'll be fine. Let's get inside.",""
"115740052-0-13768","Be wary, assistant.",""
"115740052-0-13769","Here they come!",""
"115740052-0-13770","Just a few moments more.",""
"115740052-0-13771","Done! Let's get in there.",""
"115740052-0-13772","He's right. Everything about this stinks, and not just Noggy's breath.",""
"115740052-0-13773","I'm sorry, Nogrond. I'll pass on that drink. I can't imagine the beer in Oblivion is any good anyway.",""
"115740052-0-13774","This is just another Daedric trick, and it reeks of deception. Neither of you are really here! Now, piss off!",""
"115740052-0-13775","Come on. We're done here.",""
"115740052-0-13776","Enough of this nonsense. I'll take that drink, Nogrond, and toast to our health and good fortune!",""
"115740052-0-13777","Yuck. Can't even give me cold mead in Coldharbour, you miserable Daedric bastards?",""
"115740052-0-13778","I'm finally feeling like my old self. Let's finish this!",""
"115740052-0-13779","If you'll allow me ….",""
"115740052-0-13780","Did you hear that? That sounded like … no, it couldn't be.",""
"115740052-0-13781","Just stay with me. We'll get out of this somehow.",""
"115740052-0-13782","My daughter … she … she can't be gone.",""
"115740052-0-13783","She's gone. I'm … I'm sorry. But we have to extinguish these fires somehow, otherwise we're going to join her.",""
"115740052-0-13784","We don't abide cheaters in the Crucible. Double rations for the team that brings me their heads! Let the Grand Melee begin!",""
"115740052-0-13785","Yanabir, this is my new friend. Tell us what the Pariah's Hand is up to this year.",""
"115740052-0-13786","Dollie, I'd like you to meet my new friend. We've come to learn what your plan is for this year's Boast.",""
"115740052-0-13787","Help! They mean to feed me to their beasts!",""
"115740052-0-13788","Free at last!",""
"115740052-0-13789","Well, I'm done here. Come see me in <<1>>!",""
"115740052-0-13790","I've learned a lot from you, I think. I'll try to be brave from now on!",""
"115740052-0-13791","I'm ready this time! Let's do it!",""
"115740052-0-13792","No … my beautiful daughter. Please, say something! You have to be all right. You have to be.",""
"115740052-0-13793","We have to go. We can't stay here any longer. Your daughter's gone.",""
"115740052-0-13794","We just can't leave her here like this. I have to say goodbye. Wait! What are you doing? What's happening?",""
"115740052-0-13796","Excellent! You're doing very well!",""
"115740052-0-13797","Oh dear. Please, save me! Help!",""
"115740052-0-13798","Help! Get me out of here!",""
"115740052-0-13799","We're going to die! I just know it!",""
"115740052-0-13800","That's … unbelievable. Come get me out of here.",""
"115740052-0-13801","Did you just . . . wow. I need to quit drinking.",""
"115740052-0-13802","Come on, pretty bug … time to give up your innards.",""
"115740052-0-13803","Hot guts! That's what I'm talking about!",""
"115740052-0-13804","We did it! The voices … the whispering … it's gone!",""
"115740052-0-13805","This whole time, it was like watching myself from a distance. I felt … disconnected.",""
"115740052-0-13806","But now, this is the best I've felt in years. Like I've been reborn! And I owe it all to you. Thank you.",""
"115740052-0-13807","Let's get out of here! We need to rescue Sai, then we've got a world to save!",""
"115740052-0-13808","Let's make sure we look the part, dearie.",""
"115740052-0-13809","Need to make sure we blend in.",""
"115740052-0-13810","Hey! Can you help?",""
"115740052-0-13811","Shove off, this is my spot!",""
"115740052-0-13812","Who are you? Why are you dressed as a brother?",""
"115740052-0-13813","One never knows what's going to happen when working on Dwemer devices.",""
"115740052-0-13814","I'm running a game here, lady. Get gone before my partner comes back with my ring.",""
"115740052-0-13815","Your ring? Are you stealing Rid-Thar's ring? Thief! Thief!",""
"115740052-0-13816","Oh hush. And look, my partner's come back! Let's talk, partner! There's a lot of coin in it for you.",""
"115740052-0-13817","Hah, see that priestess? My partner is wise. Very wise!",""
"115740052-0-13818","I know where she's going.",""
"115740052-0-13819","Both of you make the Moons weep. Dark Moon stalk your steps!",""
"115740052-0-13820","Go after her! If you're a part of the story, you can enter!",""
"115740052-0-13821","You see, thief? There are still good and true people in this world.",""
"115740052-0-13822","You're both idiots. At least I can sell this robe for a coin or two. Drinks for Jurak tonight!",""
"115740052-0-13823","Help! Someone help me! Sheor's beard, I didn't think today would end this badly!",""
"115740052-0-13824","The Daggerfall Covenant needs a stronger ruler, Emeric. Your reign as High King has come to an end. I'm taking Wayrest.",""
"115740052-0-13825","Damn it, Godrun. We've been friends for years …! How can you just betray me like this?",""
"115740052-0-13826","Last place I saw it was over by my boat.",""
"115740052-0-13827","Careful now! Those mudcrabs are tough!",""
"115740052-0-13828","I'm just going to stay over here. You know. Don't want to crowd you.",""
"115740052-0-13829","We have them on the run! Everyone move up to the tower!",""
"115740052-0-13830","Oh gods!",""
"115740052-0-13831","Huh. Maybe it's not work—",""
"115740052-0-13832","You there! Are the Houndsmen gone?",""
"115740052-0-13834","Tell your soldiers to stand down, Sergeant. When the reinforcements come, we march south.",""
"115740052-0-13835","Stand down? What do you mean? This is our chance to finish the ogres off!",""
"115740052-0-13836","Sounds like it worked! I'm going to go bask in the devastation.",""
"115740052-0-13837","<<1>>, my love. Thank the gods you're alive.",""
"115740052-0-13838","I'm well enough to walk. Let's get out of here.",""
"115740052-0-13839","Where'd I put that blasted shield!",""
"115740052-0-13840","The cats keep teasing me about my … vocation. Say I don't know what's funny. But they'll see. We've trapped some wee critters from the forest!",""
"115740052-0-13841","You're going with some critter underfoot tricks?",""
"115740052-0-13842","Baan Dar himself will be laughing when those cats start running from our mice. Hah!",""
"115740052-0-13843","Sounds funny, Dollie. Good luck with your tricks. Traveler, can I speak to you in private?",""
"115740052-0-13844","We have been feasting and drinking on our own trickery, Aniel! Hidden traps, potions of transformation … the Hand is at its finest this year.",""
"115740052-0-13845","Good to hear! Do you think you'll earn your way into the Dance?",""
"115740052-0-13846","Oh yes. The Khajiit are first in the eyes of Baan Dar! And we will prove ourselves worthy of the Dance!",""
"115740052-0-13847","Come along, my friend, we should be away. Let's go meet Dolirdor.",""
"115740052-0-13848","Let's talk about this, I have an idea.",""
"115740052-0-13849","What creatures  have come to visit my tomb? Come join me, the others will be here soon.",""
"115740052-0-13850","I'm not alone you know. The others, they keep me company. I feel them coming now.",""
"115740052-0-13851","Can you see them? No? Oh, they can be so shy. You just need to be properly introduced. Let me show you.",""
"115740052-0-13852","Join my nightmare.",""
"115740052-0-13853","Now do you see?",""
"115740052-0-13854","Stop that! I'm trying to show you my friends!",""
"115740052-0-13855","No, no! This is all wrong.",""
"115740052-0-13856","I don't want you to see anymore. Get out of here!",""
"115740052-0-13857","I won't be alone. I can't.",""
"115740052-0-13858","Look what you've done, How can I manage now?!?",""
"115740052-0-13859","I'll take care of this myself.",""
"115740052-0-13860","Some of the taxes from the citizens could go to help local merchants expand.",""
"115740052-0-13861","When you think about it, we merchants shouldn't have to pay taxes at all. We're bringing business into the village!",""
"115740052-0-13863","Don't question my orders! Just tell the commander we need more soldiers and more supplies.",""
"115740052-0-13864","Yes, General. If you say we need them, then we need them.",""
"115740052-0-13865","Of course I'm sure! And don't ever question my orders again!",""
"115740052-0-13866","Let's hope our luck holds. Prepare for the next attack.",""
"115740052-0-13867","That's enough, sergeant. Prepare for the next attack.",""
"115740052-0-13868","Let's hope we made the right call. Now, go.",""
"115740052-0-13869","Our recruit saved them, sir. We're lucky they were here.",""
"115740052-0-13870","We did what we had to do, sir.",""
"115740052-0-13871","Yes, sir.",""
"115740052-0-13872","We could have saved lives. We knew those people.",""
"115740052-0-13873","You dare step foot on our ship?",""
"115740052-0-13874","I am home! HOME! Finally.",""
"115740052-0-13875","Another shipment of supplies?",""
"115740052-0-13876","I have a big nose.",""
"115740052-0-13877","So we're moving camp and more supplies are coming? Sounds like this campaign's going to be longer than we thought.",""
"115740052-0-13878","Where did Jakarn hide the gem?",""
"115740052-0-13879","Maybe you should ask your Headman. The king of crooks!",""
"115740052-0-13880","Careful what you say, Elf.",""
"115740052-0-13881","I'm not afraid of you. My family could buy this whole island.",""
"115740052-0-13882","<<1>> is not dumb. You're just mean!",""
"115740052-0-13883","Captain, this isn't easy for me to say, but I want to apologize for ignoring your warnings.",""
"115740052-0-13884","It was nothing, my King. I apologize if I was impertinent in my duty.",""
"115740052-0-13885","Not at all, Aresin. Rise, please. In service to Daggerfall, our friend here is to have any support the watch or the knights can provide.",""
"115740052-0-13886","Of course. We'll do whatever we can to help find Angof and determine his motives. All of Daggerfall stands behind our hero.",""
"115740052-0-13887","Tell me quickly and truthfully. How do we fare?",""
"115740052-0-13888","Maraya … I don't understand. I know we wed for political reasons, but I thought that over the years you actually came to … I thought you loved me. If I've lost your support, then I have lost everything.",""
"115740052-0-13889","I rue the day my father gave you my hand in marriage. You're not worthy of being my husband, and you're certainly not worthy of being my king!",""
"115740052-0-13890","You will see, beast. You will see.",""
"115740052-0-13891","Everyone dead? This one is getting out of here!",""
"115740052-0-13892","My condolences to your families for the hardship you've had to face. My soldiers and I failed to protect you as we were sent to do. I will ensure that I find who is responsible for this, and avenge our people.",""
"115740052-0-13893","Fascinating!",""
"115740052-0-13894","Curse it, I can't use my hands! Assistant, you'll need to free me.",""
"115740052-0-13895","My friend, I must speak with you.",""
"115740052-0-13896","What about the cult? You crazy old wizard!",""
"115740052-0-13897","Nonsense, dear. Just send down one of our most capable assistants.",""
"115740052-0-13898","Damnit, Telenger.",""
"115740052-0-13899","I'm not going to be dirty anymore. I'm going to start by cleaning up this place.",""
"115740052-0-13900","How are we looking, Gloo?",""
"115740052-0-13901","Rangers! We face the elite troops of the Colovian army! They've attacked us in our homes. They threaten our lives, and our founder! Are you afraid of them?",""
"115740052-0-13902","No! You're not. These dogs will learn the cost of war! They will learn what it means to face the Vinedusk Rangers!",""
"115740052-0-13903","That's what I want to hear! Recruit, grab some of the admixture Gloo's prepped. We'll scout ahead.",""
"115740052-0-13904","We have enough admixture to set Arenthia ablaze if we want to. Which would make some nice after-battle entertainment, now that I think about it.",""
"115740052-0-13905","Stop the bloodshed. We should talk.",""
"115740052-0-13906","You cross Zurana? You die!",""
"115740052-0-13907","Did Telenger send you?",""
"115740052-0-13908","Surprise, friends! I have come to murder you.",""
"115740052-0-13909","Oh gods! She's rending our flesh!",""
"115740052-0-13910","We can do this one of two ways. The quick way … or the slow way.",""
"115740052-0-13911","Let's go back to the village.",""
"115740052-0-13912","I'm a terrible pirate! I'm weak, weak, weak!",""
"115740052-0-13913","I'm an awful person, a fraud. I've been faking it so long, I believed my own lies.",""
"115740052-0-13914","This should be the work of a moment.",""
"115740052-0-13915","Just need to attune this spell matrix ….",""
"115740052-0-13916","Mephala! You face Telenger the Artificer! Learn what it means to snare one such as me in your web!",""
"115740052-0-13917","Rise, blast you! Why won't you rise? This spell should work on an Ayleid!",""
"115740052-0-13918","Yes! Feel that destructive power of fire!",""
"115740052-0-13919","Don't you wish you could just bathe in the flames sometimes? Feels so. Invigorating.",""
"115740052-0-13920","Are you done in there, Glooredel?",""
"115740052-0-13921","Ah, good. It's time to leave. Rangers! We move!nnYou, get outside and start the carnage. The fun starts now!",""
"115740052-0-13922","Hey there! Need any help?",""
"115740052-0-13923","You! Hey you!",""
"115740052-0-13924","Oh, thank Yffre! I thought you'd never get here!",""
"115740052-0-13925","Nanwen! What in Oblivion? You look … good. Endarwe will be thrilled to see you!",""
"115740052-0-13926","Wait, where are you going? I … I'll just wait here, then.",""
"115740052-0-13927","We cannot resist much longer. They will break us.",""
"115740052-0-13928","We will resist as long as we are able.",""
"115740052-0-13929","No telling what those Sea Drakes have done to Iriana. And Shamal too.",""
"115740052-0-13930","Iriana's dead by now. We need to get out of here before those bastards return.",""
"115740052-0-13931","You're too late! Gar Xuu Gar comes!",""
"115740052-0-13932","Trelan is hurt, bad. Now what are we going to do?",""
"115740052-0-13933","Nothing. We can't attack a whole camp of Sea Drakes.",""
"115740052-0-13934","But we can't leave Iriana to those jackals.",""
"115740052-0-13935","So, see anything?",""
"115740052-0-13936","Nothing. Those dogs hit us and ran off.",""
"115740052-0-13937","I hear you, but we can't do anything with Trelan hurt.",""
"115740052-0-13938","I want to skin those Sea Drakes!",""
"115740052-0-13939","I can't believe they ambushed us like that and took Iriana.",""
"115740052-0-13940","We thought we were safe. But no place is safe on this island.",""
"115740052-0-13941","Drinking stops me from thinking about what the Sea Drakes might be doing to Iriana.",""
"115740052-0-13942","I feel sick.",""
"115740052-0-13943","I need another drink.",""
"115740052-0-13944","Hold there, friend. This forest is not safe.",""
"115740052-0-13945","Step lightly, and heed my warning.",""
"115740052-0-13946","Come on <<1>>. Your friend saved my life, but apparently didn't have time to save yours.",""

"115740052-0-13966","Story? No, it is a vision of what is to come, shaped according to my whim!",""
"115740052-0-13967","You assured us you could handle these foolish Altmer, Matriarch, and they are slaughtering your soldiers. Our storm spell is nearly complete, but we need the time you promised us.",""

"115740052-0-14058","All right, we've got work to do.",""
"115740052-0-14059","We've lost many securing this beach. Search for supplies and see if you can find wounded worth saving. Strict triage—we are bound to lose more before this day is over and I don't want to waste healing on the dead.",""
"115740052-0-14060","As for you .…",""
"115740052-0-14061","Shipwrecked soldiers and waterlogged vessels could come onto shore at any moment. I need you to direct the survivors and search for more out at sea. We're going to need as many capable fighters as we can get. Move out.",""

"115740052-0-14064","Gods, you weren't joking? Festius! That's our commander. He and his aides command the assault from inside the ruins! Just stop, please!",""
"115740052-0-14065","Very brave. You've earned this.",""
"115740052-0-14066","Just like old times, isn't it? I do like to have such a useful too— uh, ally, with me.",""
"115740052-0-14067","I want every corner of this cave searched. Just because that lamia matriarch's dead doesn't mean we get sloppy.nnIf we get ambushed someone's falling on their own sword.",""
"115740052-0-14068","Did you hear that the Duke of Camlorn was kidnapped? First he lost his city and now this.",""
"115740052-0-14069","Root, earth, water, grow. Spirit of the Green, sprout and show.",""
"115740052-0-14070","Right. Gloo, get up there. I need to confer with our friend here.",""
"115740052-0-14071","And we wait.",""
"115740052-0-14072","Hmm? Yes, dear. That's terrible.",""
"115740052-0-14073","Excellent. Go ahead, my new friend. Speak to it.",""
"115740052-0-14074","Who disturbs me?",""
"115740052-0-14075","Did you hear that the hunter Gloria sacrificed herself to save the Duke? Would you do that for me, Bruno?",""
"115740052-0-14076","Hmm? Yes, dear. Of course, dear.",""
"115740052-0-14077","I would speak to you again, mortal. Come through the mirror, to Quagmire.",""
"115740052-0-14078","Quickly! Over here!",""
"115740052-0-14079","Bruno, Bruno! Jacqueline told me that she saw the Duke turn into a werewolf! Isn't that terrifying?",""
"115740052-0-14080","Hmm? Werewolf? Yes, dear. Right away, dear.",""
"115740052-0-14081","I tire of sitting here, Meleril. We should head to Saintsport.",""
"115740052-0-14082","Why?",""
"115740052-0-14083","This waiting rots my limbs and wearies my mind.",""
"115740052-0-14084","There you are. Do not panic, only you can see me. Come, we have to talk.",""
"115740052-0-14085","I saw a large group of soldiers leaving the Lion Guard camp. I wonder what's going on?",""
"115740052-0-14086","Hmm? Oh, yes. I heard they're going to try to retake Camlorn.",""
"115740052-0-14087","They're scum over there. They just lure ships onto the rocks and strip the wrecks.",""
"115740052-0-14088","Bruno, did you hear the good news? They say the Lion Guard liberated Camlorn. Now all these refugees can go home.",""
"115740052-0-14089","All true, Meleril. Yet at least we would earn coin.",""
"115740052-0-14090","You go if you want. I'm staying here and waiting for a ship.",""
"115740052-0-14091","Hmm? Really, dear? That's great news, great news indeed.",""
"115740052-0-14092","Peace, Meleril. No call for such talk. I remain and will pray for patience.",""
"115740052-0-14093","I don't want any loafing around! Don't care if you're tired from scaling that sheer cliff. I'd ask you to do it again in a second. Spread out and search this place. We'll need all the supplies we can get.",""
"115740052-0-14094","Shamal must leave this evil place!",""
"115740052-0-14095","How in the Eight do you expect to trap a flying harpy with a trap set on the ground? You're an idiot, you know that, right?",""
"115740052-0-14096","Looks like we found the Remly brothers.",""
"115740052-0-14097","You know I hate it when you yell at me, brother. Now calm down and help me figure out how to get a harpy to trip a wire on the … ground. Hmm, I see the problem now.",""
"115740052-0-14098","My fondest memory, used against me for such dark purpose.",""
"115740052-0-14100","I can't, Merano, I just can't.",""
"115740052-0-14101","You can, you must. I know you want to.",""
"115740052-0-14102","But it would be wrong, I think. And dangerous.",""
"115740052-0-14103","Nonsense. You kiss him, I stab him, and then you're free!",""
"115740052-0-14104","You make it sound so simple.",""
"115740052-0-14105","It is. Let's do it tonight!",""
"115740052-0-14106","Tonight? Hush—someone's listening.",""
"115740052-0-14107","Don't try any funny business, you!",""
"115740052-0-14108","I heard Dunmer were spotted just down the river.",""
"115740052-0-14109","Really? I've never seen one before. Hope they aren't planning a raid.",""
"115740052-0-14110","I know what you mean. My heart might give out if there's another battle.",""
"115740052-0-14111","The Green Lady knows the forest's will. She'd give up her life rather than shirk her duty.",""
"115740052-0-14112","You have the scroll. Rejoice that you did not fail. Vardan will be pleased.",""
"115740052-0-14113","I live to serve my masters.",""
"115740052-0-14114","Go west to the Ayleid site. The scroll's ritual should enable you to succeed where the others failed.",""

"115740052-0-14116","Hircine laid a trap and I walked into it. If I'd known, would I've chosen a different path?",""

"115740052-0-14118","Captain! Blessed Y'ffre, I found you.",""
"115740052-0-14119","Sister Safia was never worthy of you.",""
"115740052-0-14120","At one time there was a spark between Safia and I, but she doesn't hold a candle to you.",""
"115740052-0-14121","Durak is weak. The Shard should be ours.",""
"115740052-0-14122","Stealing from Durak will be as easy as stealing a sweet roll from a baby.",""
"115740052-0-14123","Good. This should be the last conduit. Let's take it apart.",""
"115740052-0-14124","Now, read the scroll! The ritual it holds will send you into the spirit realm.",""
"115740052-0-14125","Should you succeed, I will follow.",""
"115740052-0-14126","In the name of the Bloodthorns, enter the spirit realm!",""
"115740052-0-14127","Failure again! Perhaps an ancient curse lingers here. I will try the ritual in our lair.",""
"115740052-0-14128","Are you ready for the fun to begin?",""
"115740052-0-14129","Get back to him and keep me informed!",""
"115740052-0-14130","Lord Gharesh-ri is wounded, but alive!",""
"115740052-0-14131","There's never anything new here. Perhaps a ship will come soon.",""
"115740052-0-14132","The ambassador must know about this!",""
"115740052-0-14133","There you are, my poor darling. You must have been sleepwalking again. You were gone when I woke up.",""
"115740052-0-14134","Yes, dear. Sleepwalking. Again.",""
"115740052-0-14135","Wait … is that Gelvin up there? What in Malacath's name is he tangled up in?",""
"115740052-0-14136","Was my little cuddle bear frightened? You're safe now. I'll get you to my mother's. Have you snug as a bug in a rug in no time. And don't worry. I'll kill anyone or anything that gets in our way.",""
"115740052-0-14137","Yes, dear. I'm sure you will.",""
"115740052-0-14138","Well, that's enough excitement for one day. Come along, dearest. The sooner we get you to safety, the sooner I can get back to work.",""
"115740052-0-14139","Well, look who's here.",""
"115740052-0-14140","Thank you, old friend. Thought I was going to become bird food before you got here.",""
"115740052-0-14141","Thanks, stranger. For nothing.",""
"115740052-0-14142","Don't forget to thank the kind stranger for helping you, dear.",""
"115740052-0-14143","Let me guess, you want into the Bloodthorn's secret lair?",""
"115740052-0-14144","I unburdened their secret entrance of its lock.",""
"115740052-0-14145","This is a fresh kill. Be alert. Whatever did this could be watching us.",""
"115740052-0-14146","May those who met their demise find peace now.",""
"115740052-0-14147","That's all that Lord Diel asked us to do. Let's head back, but I want to have a chat before we enter the camp.",""
"115740052-0-14148","How long are we going to wait, Uggnath?",""
"115740052-0-14149","Until a ship comes in.",""
"115740052-0-14150","Maybe we could kill Kaleen and take the ship back.",""
"115740052-0-14151","Ha! That'd end the waiting 'cause we'd be dead!",""
"115740052-0-14152","It's only her and Lambur. Mostly.",""
"115740052-0-14153","More'n enough to take any ten of us. Sit down and shut up.",""
"115740052-0-14154","What's this? Yes, I feel your power. But how do you work?",""
"115740052-0-14155","Strange that such a small thing can cause such terror. It must be destroyed!",""
"115740052-0-14156","Hold on. Let's think about this.",""

"115740052-0-14393","Give back that stone, graverobber!",""
"115740052-0-14394","In the name of Jone and Jode, let this artifact be filled with moonlight.",""
"115740052-0-14395","Heard the Shadowscales aren't taking any more contracts.",""
"115740052-0-14396","Shh! You think no contracts means no ears in town?",""
"115740052-0-14397","Sanctioned killers on our doorstep, and we're worried about invaders?",""
"115740052-0-14398","I wouldn't say that too loud. Shadowscales have a lot of friends in these parts.",""
"115740052-0-14399","Hsst! It's the walker in shadow and in light!",""
"115740052-0-14400","I saw strange lights coming from <<1>>. I thought it was deserted?",""
"115740052-0-14401","Daedric ruins are never deserted. Stay away, if you know what's good for you.",""
"115740052-0-14402","I'm looking for a matching piece. Know where I'd find such an artifact?",""
"115740052-0-14403","<<1>>, but you better have gold to spend. Few are willing to scrounge in Daedric ruins!",""
"115740052-0-14404","You hear the vicecanons rooted out a Dominion camp in those Daedric ruins?",""
"115740052-0-14405","Take care of this nuisance. He's trying to help the lizards.",""
"115740052-0-14406","Yeah, but they had outside help. Typical.",""
"115740052-0-14407","<<1>> hasn't picked up his mead cask in a while. Wonder what's wrong?",""
"115740052-0-14408","You hadn't heard? The Dominion killed him at <<1>>. Pretty serious stuff.",""
"115740052-0-14409","Serious to me! Who else is going to drink this swill!",""
"115740052-0-14410","Seems even our hatchlings aren't safe. A friend of mine lost an egg!",""
"115740052-0-14411","Horrible! What happened?",""
"115740052-0-14412","I didn't want to pry. They'd worked so hard for that child.",""
"115740052-0-14413","They say the Hist weeps with happiness when an Argonian hatches. How can a tree weep?",""
"115740052-0-14414","What nonsense. Everyone knows the Hist isn't a tree!",""
"115740052-0-14415","Oh? Maybe it's a giant Argonian dungpile! Now who's the silly one?",""
"115740052-0-14416","I just got word. I'm an uncle! An uncle!",""
"115740052-0-14417","What's the lucky tot's name?",""
"115740052-0-14418","I can't pronounce Argonian names. Have to settle for calling him ""Junior.""",""
"115740052-0-14419","I saw the Keeper in town not too long ago. He looked so sad!",""
"115740052-0-14420","Didn't you hear? The hatching almost didn't happen.",""
"115740052-0-14421","This is it! I found the key! Now we can go to the vault and see if we can get the device to work.",""
"115740052-0-14422","I see why he's been upset. If all those unborn withered away … unthinkable.",""
"115740052-0-14423","How could those Bosmer attack a nursery? Have they no shame!",""
"115740052-0-14424","You can't trust a creature that eats its own kind. Savages, the lot of them.",""
"115740052-0-14425","What could the Dominion want with a dead Hist?",""
"115740052-0-14426","I didn't know the Hist could die! What does a dead Hist look like?",""
"115740052-0-14427","Dead's not quite right. It's like it's born backwards. When it dies, it turns into an egg. Or so they say.",""
"115740052-0-14428","No! You can't beat me!",""
"115740052-0-14429","This is it! Found it! Okay, let's get to the vault! It should be further in.",""
"115740052-0-14430","Sounds like someone's been in the swamp too long ….",""
"115740052-0-14431","Did you hear? The alchemist is dead!",""
"115740052-0-14432","The who? You mean that crazy Altmer?",""
"115740052-0-14433","Indeed! What an evil creature. The world's better off with him gone.",""
"115740052-0-14434","The Hist is saved! Maybe they'll bring it to Stormhold.",""
"115740052-0-14435","I heard it was going to the Dunmer lands. A shame.",""
"115740052-0-14436","What were the Dominion trying to do with the Hist?",""
"115740052-0-14437","Glad we don't have to find out. I heard the vicecanons are returning victorious!",""
"115740052-0-14438","Did you know there're still people in the old Imperial prison?",""
"115740052-0-14439","They left them to die? How heartless!",""
"115740052-0-14440","They're Imperials. They'd leave their own mother to die if it gave them an advantage!",""
"115740052-0-14441","I wonder what the Kothringi were like? Warriors? Diplomats?",""
"115740052-0-14442","They found one alive, did you hear?",""
"115740052-0-14443","Yeah, but he's probably mad. How could you survive, if your entire race died around you?",""
"115740052-0-14444","Finally got my shipment of scribs in! Seems the Renrijra've turned to different prey!",""
"115740052-0-14445","One's coming. Wait until I give the signal.",""
"115740052-0-14446","Or the Khajiit lost their taste for kwama. Best not question a blessing, I suppose.",""
"115740052-0-14447","I'm glad that Altmer didn't make it through the trials of the Hist. Couldn't be good intentions, whatever he wanted.",""
"115740052-0-14448","Agreed. But another stranger completed the trial. I wonder what they asked?",""
"115740052-0-14449","What do you think those relics down in Bogmother did? Anything?",""
"115740052-0-14450","Only the swamps know, and they're not telling.",""
"115740052-0-14451","Now!",""
"115740052-0-14452","Get up. There is no time for rest in the world of dreams.",""
"115740052-0-14453","I must return the relics to their rightful places, and quickly!",""
"115740052-0-14454","My fine ladies and handsome gentleman, it is time for music. Relax and listen to my songs. Let the music soothe you.",""
"115740052-0-14455","See that? That's a Dwemer memory device. I've seen them before, but never one that was intact.",""
"115740052-0-14456","I see a keyhole and a picture of an orb of some kind. Why don't you see if that journal over there says anything important.",""
"115740052-0-14457","I would give it all, Mira. The sword, the keep, the kingdom … all of it for you ….",""
"115740052-0-14458","Ah, I hoped I'd find you two down here. I repaired the lift. What did you find?",""
"115740052-0-14459","Indal, please don't go.",""
"115740052-0-14460","I have no choice. It's my duty, 'Tayah.",""
"115740052-0-14461","Take this token. Pray for Indal. Promise?",""
"115740052-0-14462","I promise, Indal. Stay safe.",""
"115740052-0-14463","I… I forgive you father.",""
"115740052-0-14464","Jone and Jode … keep this one's brother safe.",""
"115740052-0-14465","Watch over Indal. Keep him safe in the fighting to come.",""
"115740052-0-14466","Bring him home. He's all I have left.",""
"115740052-0-14467","Do'Krin Monastery? Is this a dream? It feels so real.",""
"115740052-0-14468","Indal, I'm here. I'm sorry, brother. I am dead.",""
"115740052-0-14469","'Tayah? This can't be true. This must be a dream.",""
"115740052-0-14470","This is a dream for you, but I speak truth.",""
"115740052-0-14471","A kindly stranger has fulfilled your sister's prayer.",""
"115740052-0-14472","Jone and Jode saw fit to reunite us one final time.",""
"115740052-0-14473","This can't be goodbye.",""
"115740052-0-14474","Your 'Tayah will always be with you. I love you, brother.",""
"115740052-0-14475","I love you, sister.",""
"115740052-0-14476","Just for a moment. We need to get back to town, safer there.",""
"115740052-0-14477","As soon as you're rested, we'll go. No sense running back to town just to have you die on me.",""
"115740052-0-14478","Raynor, this device fills up glass orbs with old lore, like filling a decanter with fine wine!",""
"115740052-0-14479","A memory device? You found one that works?",""
"115740052-0-14480","It's intact. But we need a glass orb to see if it actually works.",""
"115740052-0-14481","Did you figure out what kind of lore the device contains?",""
"115740052-0-14482","I see two important bits of lore. One explains how Dwemer used soul gems to power their constructs. The other contains a map of Dwemer ruins across Tamriel.",""
"115740052-0-14483","Soul gems? That knowledge would open a lot of doors for us. A lot of doors.",""
"115740052-0-14484","But think about what we can do with those maps! Access to every ruin. Those are the doors we should be opening!",""
"115740052-0-14485","Are you suggesting that we become common … treasure hunters? Well, think how famous we'll become if we bring both bits of lore to the Mages Guild.",""
"115740052-0-14486","I don't think we can, brother. I think there's only enough power in this device to make one imprinting.",""
"115740052-0-14487","But we've worked so hard to get them to listen to us. This is our chance, sister.",""
"115740052-0-14488","I'm not sure. But our friend here has found an orb we can use. Hey! What do you think we should do?",""
"115740052-0-14489","I am so sorry, my sister. I failed you.",""
"115740052-0-14490","<<1>>, we need to go. It's not safe here.",""
"115740052-0-14491","Fine, you stubborn fool. <<1>> and <<2>>, keep an eye on <<3>>.",""
"115740052-0-14492","You got it, <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-14493","Don't worry, we'll be ready for them next time.",""
"115740052-0-14494","Don't stay too long. Meet us back at the tavern.",""
"115740052-0-14495","You who were condemned. Hear me. Your only hope of being released is to tell us why the dead have been risen.",""
"115740052-0-14496","Your precious Champion struggles and twists, like a bug in amber. Your Champion is mine, now.",""
"115740052-0-14497","You cannot stop the inevitable. The city is ours. Soon I will hold your ""Mane"" in my hand, and my Dark Mane will walk the Path. The soul of the Khajiit will be lost to darkness!",""
"115740052-0-14498","Don't take long. We must press on with our efforts.",""
"115740052-0-14499","You would've been proud of our friends. Taking on that giant Storm Atronach without my help. They're almost as brave as our Rangers, you know?",""
"115740052-0-14500","Aunt? Uncle? You're alive! I'm overjoyed. I tried looking for you. Luckily the Moon-Hallowed and our friend were able to clear the city.",""
"115740052-0-14501","We're proud to say we could help you during the invasion. Good luck on your Path!",""
"115740052-0-14502","You've saved one of greatest treasures of the Dominion. Dune is once again a shining jewel in the desert. Thank you.",""
"115740052-0-14503","Thank you. I thought I was done for.",""
"115740052-0-14504","Eagles, advance!",""
"115740052-0-14505","Aldmeri Dominion!",""
"115740052-0-14506","The Thalmor commands!",""
"115740052-0-14507","You cannot stop the forces of Javad Tharn!",""
"115740052-0-14508","I'm not a traitor! I just joined the winning side.",""
"115740052-0-14509","Damn it Jorunn. Why force my hand like that? nnI'm sorry, I need to read these after-action reports.",""
"115740052-0-14510","Sorry, I need a moment. More news from the front in Cyrodiil.",""
"115740052-0-14511","Emeric, you silly fool. I'll never let you get away with that.nnSorry, I need to read these after-action reports.",""
"115740052-0-14512","Aha! You'll fetch a pretty penny in Balmora!",""
"115740052-0-14513","Raargh!",""
"115740052-0-14514","Thank you, my friend. I'll see you on the other side!",""
"115740052-0-14515","What are you doing? You should have destroyed it!",""
"115740052-0-14516","We'll speak of this outside. Tersely.",""
"115740052-0-14517","Come on. Help me out, before the guards come.",""
"115740052-0-14519","The ogres are running! We can move up! Sound the horn!",""
"115740052-0-14520","We need to find that intel. Get back in there!",""
"115740052-0-14521","Please, traveler, speak with me. I have no one else to turn to.",""
"115740052-0-14522","It's an Eye of the Queen! Get him!",""
"115740052-0-14523","'Tayah, no! What's going on?",""
"115740052-0-14524","This one would speak with you again, traveler.",""
"115740052-0-14525","Again Remius? You need to give up. Almerel will never let you have her.",""
"115740052-0-14526","I'll never give up. Madria and I will be together, no matter what her father says!",""
"115740052-0-14527","Well, best of luck to you, Remius.",""
"115740052-0-14528","Wish me luck, Lulius. I'm going to see Almerel again.",""
"115740052-0-14529","You need more than luck to change Almerel's mind.  You need help from the Divines themselves!",""
"115740052-0-14530","Let's see if I can speak to this one.",""
"115740052-0-14531","Come here, little one ….",""
"115740052-0-14532","Yes. That would be so helpful. Thank you.",""
"115740052-0-14533","It's that fool Remius again. Madria, go inside. Now.",""
"115740052-0-14534","Just wanted to be sure you were well protected. Go ahead, Hallowed.",""
"115740052-0-14535","Nice work. See you at the temple door.",""
"115740052-0-14536","I wish you'd give him a chance, father.",""
"115740052-0-14537","Off it goes. Follow it to find the skulls and and then meet me at the Stone Table.",""
"115740052-0-14538","If I can't persuade you, I'll have to stop you!",""
"115740052-0-14539","Let's keep after it! They can be quick!",""
"115740052-0-14540","Lets see if it can find another.",""
"115740052-0-14541","Looks like I can find the second.",""
"115740052-0-14542","One more to go.",""
"115740052-0-14543","Ok take us to the next that we seek…",""
"115740052-0-14544","Third and last!",""
"115740052-0-14545","They come for the beacon!",""
"115740052-0-14546","Last one. Then we can talk to the skulls.",""
"115740052-0-14547","More of them! Watch yourself!",""
"115740052-0-14548","Let's take the skulls to the stone table to interrogate them.",""
"115740052-0-14549","It is done. Thank you, Hallowed. I shall meet you at the temple entrance.",""
"115740052-0-14550","Almerel—I am here once again, to beg for your daughter's hand in marriage.",""
"115740052-0-14551","Never! My daughter will not marry a Breton without renown or prospects. Crawl back in your hole!",""
"115740052-0-14552","I'll never give up. Madria and I are meant to be together!",""
"115740052-0-14553","Never. I'll see her dead first!",""
"115740052-0-14554","Jone and Jode wax, rising into the darkness.",""
"115740052-0-14555","The fullness of the two moons hang in the darkness above.",""
"115740052-0-14556","With regret, the Bright Moons wane from the sky.",""
"115740052-0-14557","The inner sanctum should be open to we pilgrims, now.",""
"115740052-0-14558","Merely touch the senche, and unlock the way to the reliquary.",""
"115740052-0-14559","Jone and Jode be praised. The Golden Claw, intact.",""
"115740052-0-14560","An intruder, a Tharn! Destroy him!",""
"115740052-0-14561","That old cart broken again? Long past time you two bought a new one.",""
"115740052-0-14562","You know Larus. He thinks he can fix anything.",""
"115740052-0-14563","At'avar's just on the other side of this door. I can smell him.",""
"115740052-0-14564","How're things, Prefect?",""
"115740052-0-14565","Hey there, Lorene. Busy as usual, eh?",""
"115740052-0-14566","At least I work sometimes, Ilwen, unlike you. Go make yourself useful for a change.",""
"115740052-0-14567","Make sure you get that wine stain out of my shirt, Swifty. I want to wear it this weekend.",""
"115740052-0-14568","Your hands are idle, as always, Ilwen. Feel free to wash it yourself.",""
"115740052-0-14569","It is done. Bright moons be praised.",""
"115740052-0-14570","Indaenir, the tunnel is finally clear. Akkhuz-ri will return to Marbruk and send soldiers to reinforce this location.",""
"115740052-0-14571","Yes. Yes. That makes sense. Perhaps it's better if I go out into the pass and try to discover why Naemon ordered the undead to attack in the first place.",""
"115740052-0-14572","Yes. Both of you go. Find out what Naemon is planning and report to Marbruk. Don't try to do all this on your own … and of course, may bright moons light your path.",""
"115740052-0-14573","My crew will rig the mast with your entrails. Get up, boys. Time to earn your keep!",""
"115740052-0-14574","I've been underground too long. I can't wait to get back out into the forest.",""
"115740052-0-14575","I didn't think I was being disrespectful.",""
"115740052-0-14576","Sometimes, people are just impossible to understand.",""
"115740052-0-14577","Be ready. This one is counting on you to watch his … er, her back.",""
"115740052-0-14578","Asteril, is that you?",""
"115740052-0-14579","Yes. Come closer, my queen. I have something for you.",""
"115740052-0-14580","A gift in memory of Prince Naemon … Vicereeve Pelidil sends his regards.",""
"115740052-0-14581","What is this?",""
"115740052-0-14582","So you are trying to assassinate the queen … I mean ""me""?",""
"115740052-0-14583","You will die, and the true king of Alinor will rise again!",""
"115740052-0-14584","Argh! Divines, that hurt!",""
"115740052-0-14585","Hurry. There's no time to waste!",""
"115740052-0-14586","I think that should do it. The altars are all cleansed. I think we can finish the path now. What's that?",""
"115740052-0-14587","You are too late! The city is ours! Your faith cannot overcome the Master's Mace!",""
"115740052-0-14588","Be careful up ahead. Some of my friends came to a bad end during the fight with the Whisperer. We don't go there anymore.",""
"115740052-0-14589","The Stone Table is where the Bosmer who violated the Pact received their judgment. Let's see if they remember it.",""
"115740052-0-14590","Ha! We need no release. The Shade of Naemon heralds a new age—an age where we will be restored, and you are the ones who will be judged.",""
"115740052-0-14591","Hold on. How do you know that? Did the Shade actually tell you that?",""
"115740052-0-14592","He doesn't have to. When the forest is transformed, who do you think will inhabit the Shadow Wood? We will!",""
"115740052-0-14593","Naemon does not have the power to release any of you, but I do. Help us, and you'll have your chance at freedom.",""
"115740052-0-14594","I'll tell you. Don't listen to that fool. The Shade seeks to corrupt the forest—to create a new realm—it's called the Shadow Wood.",""
"115740052-0-14595","There are already rifts between here and the Shadow Wood. Your only hope is to close them. Now, do as you promised. Release us!",""
"115740052-0-14596","You won't live to tell this tale!",""

"115740052-0-14680","Oh, that's right. They're dead. Just like you're about to be. You know, you were a real pain in my side. I sent you after Yjarnn and Marla, but somehow you survived.",""
"115740052-0-14681","Then I sent you to sabotage the Prince, but instead you brought the Pact together. Well, if you want something done, you just have to do it yourself.",""
"115740052-0-14682","Wait! Don't kill me! I … I can help you. Jorunn's still alive. You need me!",""

"115740052-0-14709","Where are you going? The castle's tower isn't this way. Turn around!",""
"115740052-0-14710","You still awake up here?",""

"115740052-0-14715","About time. You're 10 minutes late!",""
"115740052-0-14716","There you are. Never leave us stranded again.",""
"115740052-0-14717","Who's out there? If you're one of the Stormfists, you'll regret it if you come in here!",""

"115740052-0-14746","The false king and his foreign allies can throw challengers at me as often as they want. I so enjoy killing them.",""

"115740052-0-14748","Look at your soldiers, Jorunn. This is what happened to us. Locked away in some crypt like commoners. No one cared that we died, especially you. We were just pawns for you!",""
"115740052-0-14749","We had families. The day we died for you, we lost our lovers. Our children. You know how it feels, don't you? Yet you didn't care. You threw us out there. You let us be killed by the Akaviri!",""
"115740052-0-14750","No. I respected and cared for each and every one of you. With each of your deaths, I lost brothers and sisters. But we fought for what we all believed in. We fought for our freedom!",""

"115740052-0-14756","Well, this turned out to be an interesting hunting trip. So much for knowing the area like the back of your hand, right, sister?",""
"115740052-0-14757","Yes, yes, go ahead. Mock me, little brother. I should just leave you in this cave. Maybe you'd lose a foot to the frost and the people would call you the Gimp Prince. That would be the last time you mocked me, that's for sure.",""
"115740052-0-14758","Oh, I think I would write a ballad about how an ice demon and I dueled upon the mountain tops and I drove my blade into him as he took my foot. All the ladies would find me heroic. Maybe I should let my foot fall off.",""
"115740052-0-14759","Sounds like something you'd do. You're the only man I've ever known to write an epic about how you fell down and broke your nose. Did that Nord lass you brought home really believe that story about you and the troll?",""
"115740052-0-14760","This cave goes on forever. And the cold. It's bitter to the bone. I think I'm starting to lose the feeling in my legs. I hate when that happens.",""

"115740052-0-14763","You hush, now, brother! Fildgor showed me how to find my way out of a cave, or any closed area, really. You just need to find the wind. Once you do that, you can figure out where it's coming from. And that's the way out. Simple!",""
"115740052-0-14764","Come on, Jorunn. We have to keep moving. We're almost there. I can feel it.",""
"115740052-0-14765","Please, brother. It's just a little bit farther. You have to hold on. I … I need you. I can't become Queen without my brothers at my side. I … I just can't do it. Stay with me, brother. Wake up!",""

"115740052-0-14771","Let me explain how things work around here.",""
"115740052-0-14772","I will bring the Crown of Freydis to my brother. Don't worry, I give you my word that this is finished.",""

"115740052-0-14785","Here we go.",""

"115740052-0-14793","There is a chance this Wilderking does not exist at all and those Bosmer bow to an imaginary ruler.",""
"115740052-0-14794","Killing this Wilderking will drive the Bosmer mad. He is very elusive though, so I will need your help to find him.",""
"115740052-0-14795","You and I will go to the Valenwood together to face this foe.",""
"115740052-0-14796","They say the Wilderking is very tricky, but you must not let him muddle your mind. He is an enemy and must be destroyed.",""
"115740052-0-14797","There are rumors that he can manipulate the forest and the land in the Valenwood to defend himself. That's why I need you there.",""
"115740052-0-14798","You realize we are entrusting you with an important task, I hope, my dear.",""
"115740052-0-14799","Of course, Lady Estre. You can count on me.",""
"115740052-0-14800","This should do it.",""
"115740052-0-14801","Finally, this nightmare will come to an end.",""
"115740052-0-14802","With all respect, Your Majesty, this proves our suspicions were well-founded … you should have heeded my father's warning.",""
"115740052-0-14803","It is not the place of the dishonored to correct the king, Ash'abah. You are dismissed.",""
"115740052-0-14804","I meant no disrespect, Your Majesty, only that … you know where to find us. I will take my leave.",""
"115740052-0-14805","Are you insane, Shifty? You'll kill us all!",""
"115740052-0-14806","Mortal worm! Get away from there!",""
"115740052-0-14807","That's the point, friend! This is no way for a man to live.",""
"115740052-0-14808","To kill Rillis, he must be contained completely in a mortal body. My body.",""
"115740052-0-14809","When I'm in position, I need you to use the final binding stone. I will intercept Rillis' essence, and we will be one. You'll have to strike us down.",""
"115740052-0-14810","Hold nothing back. I break my oath as Keeper to see Rilis finished, and if he escapes, all of Tamriel will pay for our folly.",""
"115740052-0-14811","Look for the glimmers of the past I spoke of. Hopefully, they will help us figure out how to put the Blackroot clan back to rest.",""
"115740052-0-14812","Ha ha ha ha!",""
"115740052-0-14813","I've wanted this for so very long. Now get out of my way. All of Tamriel will learn I am free when I set the land ablaze.",""
"115740052-0-14814","Fight well, my friend. You fight for all of us.",""
"115740052-0-14815","What in Nirn?",""
"115740052-0-14817","Come on! You can do it! Just one more bite!",""
"115740052-0-14818","This is the most revolting display of power eating that I've ever witnessed. Hey! Down in front!",""
"115740052-0-14819","That bowl of jiggling jelly looks delicious! Can I get the recipe?",""
"115740052-0-14820","I think I'm going to be ill.",""
"115740052-0-14821","I could eat more than all of these contestants combined! They dishonor the King with this poor showing!",""
"115740052-0-14823","Blades ready, comrade. These constructs know no mercy.",""
"115740052-0-14824","The skill it took to craft these constructs. Amazing.",""
"115740052-0-14825","Just think what this place must have looked like in the time of the Dwemer.",""
"115740052-0-14826","You aren't like the others. You should keep your own face, it suits you better.",""
"115740052-0-14827","No one can outdrink Thane Jeggi! He's got this contest in the bag!",""
"115740052-0-14828","I'm not sure about that. The Nord woman from Whiterun looks like she can hold her mead.",""
"115740052-0-14829","What interesting customs you Nords have. Drink too much and throw up, all to honor your King.",""
"115740052-0-14830","If they were serving hundred-year-old flin, I'd enter this contest in a heart beat.",""
"115740052-0-14831","They're running low on mead! I wonder what happened to that shipment from Voljar's Meadery?",""
"115740052-0-14832","Stay away from my new face!",""
"115740052-0-14833","What's that over there?",""
"115740052-0-14834","What are you doing? Hide, before the Dominion spots you!",""
"115740052-0-14835","More wonders. And a split in the path. Which way shall we go, comrade?",""
"115740052-0-14836","They brought him past the cave. Strange … it is an old smell.",""
"115740052-0-14837","They dragged him up this rise, straight ahead. He didn't struggle.",""
"115740052-0-14838","I don't care how big it is. It's in my way, it dies.",""
"115740052-0-14839","Thank you, friend! Quickly, meet me in that cave!",""
"115740052-0-14840","Skordo set up a rendezvous point in the north part of the pit. I'll see you there!",""
"115740052-0-14841","Holy Divines, look at the size of that thing!",""
"115740052-0-14842","Damn, she didn't make it. Find your ancestors, friend. And know that Vikord will avenge you.",""
"115740052-0-14843","You continue to impress, my friend! You've beaten Blackheart. Now to finish him for good.",""
"115740052-0-14845","Please! I must find him!",""
"115740052-0-14846","Farewell, my son. Tell your mother I'm sorry.",""
"115740052-0-14847","You've helped us get this far, friends. I know we can trust you with our secret.",""
"115740052-0-14848","Let's show them what happens when they mess with Hircine's chosen.",""
"115740052-0-14849","You Altmer are so predictable. So arrogant.",""
"115740052-0-14850","Sud-Hareem! You've escaped!",""
"115740052-0-14851","Yes, Praxin. The Whisperer is gone.",""
"115740052-0-14852","I don't feel so good.",""
"115740052-0-14853","No. You can't be real. I was going to rescue you. And then I heard her voice.",""
"115740052-0-14854","It's over, Praxin. You can rest now.",""
"115740052-0-14855","Boss, I don't think he's listening.",""
"115740052-0-14856","You aren't real. You're one of her illusions. I won't let you stop us!",""
"115740052-0-14857","What is this rat doing in here? Get out you damn thing!",""
"115740052-0-14858","Why is nothing ever easy?",""
"115740052-0-14859","No! Stop! How dare you!",""
"115740052-0-14860","You're not getting away that easily!",""
"115740052-0-14861","What a skeever!",""
"115740052-0-14862","Finally. Come on, we need to figure out how we'll tackle this.",""
"115740052-0-14863","I tell you Galdas, that was impressive work. An adept facing Sheogorath himself!",""
"115740052-0-14864","Working along side Valaste herself. The Mistress of Incunabula, and an ancient Arch-Mage. Making a tart seems pretty simple in comparison.",""
"115740052-0-14865","It's a whole new chapter in the Guild. All thanks to one person. Amazing.",""
"115740052-0-14866","Ready!",""
"115740052-0-14867","Set!",""
"115740052-0-14868","We have a winner!",""
"115740052-0-14869","Spikeball!",""
"115740052-0-14870","Please return to the starting line.",""
"115740052-0-14871","That might be our best chance to get inside.",""
"115740052-0-14872","There'll be a lot of guards that way. Sounds like fun!",""
"115740052-0-14873","Good idea. I'll play along, that's one battle we can avoid.",""
"115740052-0-14874","You better know what you're doing! I wanted to bash his head in.",""
"115740052-0-14875","A moment. This may be crucial.",""
"115740052-0-14876","Its people were devoted to Prince Meridia, the radiant one. They lived in peace and assumed themselves safe from any dangers.",""
"115740052-0-14877","Where is my meal, woman?",""
"115740052-0-14878","Coming right away, dear.nnI hope this works.",""
"115740052-0-14879","The city's defenders did what they could, but they were no match for Molag Bal's forces. Everyone outside the walls was slaughtered, but the warriors and mages managed to seal the gates to protect those huddled within.",""
"115740052-0-14880","The Ayleid King single-handedly protected one of the gates. As he fought, he prayed for assistance. And his prayers were answered.",""
"115740052-0-14881","Meridia warded the city and pushed it into Coldharbour. The city arrived intact, but many of its inhabitants were either killed or scattered by this realm's protective spells. Even the Ayleid King was captured.",""
"115740052-0-14882","The survivors lost faith, however. One-by-one, they left the safe confines of the city to try to return to Nirn. They were foolish, and they paid the price for rejecting Meridia's edicts.",""
"115740052-0-14883","I say that the day has finally arrived! The Great Mage, Vanus Galerion. The Ayleid King. And you, our last, best hope. You must gather your allies and bring them here.",""
"115740052-0-14884","I will not stop. I will eat my fill while I still can.",""
"115740052-0-14885","Stay away from the eggs, you monster!",""
"115740052-0-14886","Come then, scale skin. I'd like to see you stop me.",""
"115740052-0-14887","It's about time. This better be good!",""
"115740052-0-14888","This tastes … different than usual.",""
"115740052-0-14889","A Dominion soldier, in the enclave? We must be more vigilant!",""
"115740052-0-14890","The time of hatching has come. We gather by the boughs of the Hist ….",""
"115740052-0-14891","Ah well. We're not picky, are we girls? Fresh meat is good meat, no?nnLet's find out how this meat tastes!",""
"115740052-0-14892","Long ago, this city existed in Nirn. It was alive and vibrant and went by a different name.",""
"115740052-0-14893","But Meridia has enemies, such as the despicable Molag Bal. The Prince of Murder sent minions from Coldharbour to destroy her beloved city.",""
"115740052-0-14894","As fortune would have it, the Ayleid King Laloriaran Dynar was visiting the city. A skilled warrior and tactician, he quickly took command of the city's defenses.",""
"115740052-0-14895","Meridia felt compassion for her followers, but she also saw an opportunity. Molag Bal's open portal worked both ways. The time had come to take the battle to Coldharbour.",""
"115740052-0-14896","Still, Meridia had accomplished the impossible. She stabbed a dagger into Molag Bal's side. A portion of her realm was in his domain—and he could not touch it.",""
"115740052-0-14897","Meridia foresaw a day when an opportunity would arise. An overconfident Molag Bal. Champions from another plane. On that day, this city would become the focal point for the assault against the Lord of Schemes.",""
"115740052-0-14898","Mortal weakling! I don't know how you got past my illusions, but it will avail you nothing!",""
"115740052-0-14899","Hah! Guess it still hasn't gotten old. I'll meet you up ahead, at the bustling Pact town of Heartholdhelm!",""
"115740052-0-14900","There's no time. Run!",""
"115740052-0-14901","Return to the void. Return. Return ….",""
"115740052-0-14902","You! Hurry up, the Worms are on the move.",""
"115740052-0-14903","They think he's as much of a waste of meat as we do, eh? I got an idea …",""
"115740052-0-14904","Go ahead, outsider. Strike the first blow.",""
"115740052-0-14905","Good to see you again Halindor. Make sure to check on your wife soon.",""
"115740052-0-14906","Look, another one.",""
"115740052-0-14907","Amazing these halls remain intact.",""
"115740052-0-14908","And still more active constructs.",""
"115740052-0-14909","Sithis, exchange my life for the void! Ahhh!",""
"115740052-0-14910","I can't hold back the void for much longer!",""
"115740052-0-14911","Your feet must move, Rahim. Now attack. Attack!",""
"115740052-0-14912","Your sword has not earned its rest yet - it must stay wakeful and swift.  Only the bloodied blade deserves the scabbard. Strike!",""
"115740052-0-14913","You must follow through on your swing, my friend. Wide arcs - like the crescent moon.",""
"115740052-0-14914","Lift your chin. Shoulders up. Now strike!",""
"115740052-0-14915","That's the last of them, General. The village is clear.",""
"115740052-0-14916","An easy victory! Vullain is the first to fall, but there will be more.",""
"115740052-0-14917","Now, per the Meat Mandate, let us feast on the fallen.",""
"115740052-0-14918","This will require all my concentration. Stay vigilant, yes?",""
"115740052-0-14919","I can hear <<A:1>>. Such … rage!",""
"115740052-0-14920","Wha…? How did you get here so soon? Halindor said they would stop you!",""
"115740052-0-14921","You killed Ifriz, Eilram! What else could there possibly be left to talk about?",""
"115740052-0-14922","You may have noticed Kudda-dar is not sad at his daughter's deaths. Let me show you why.",""
"115740052-0-14923","Selene blessed them with her gift—the gift of spirit life. See their hunt begin anew!",""
"115740052-0-14924","Gwilir! If you had half a brain in your head, you'd run and hide.",""
"115740052-0-14925","Skordo, you're free! By Y'ffre, you don't know how relieved I am to see you.",""
"115740052-0-14926","I'm really sorry, Skordo! I didn't mean to cause so much trouble!",""
"115740052-0-14927","You led an army of Daedra right toward us! You ignorant, scatterbrained, sorry excuse for a Wood Elf, weakling!",""
"115740052-0-14928","What are you doing?",""
"115740052-0-14929","I'll never do anything like that again! I promise!",""
"115740052-0-14930","Thanks again for your help. Now excuse me while I go find that good-for-nothing Wood Elf and introduce his backside to my very large boot.",""
"115740052-0-14931","I'll see what else I can find out while you go help my friends.",""
"115740052-0-14932","Come on Arakh, we need to get people moving.",""
"115740052-0-14933","Help from a Dremora? Why doesn't that reassure me?",""
"115740052-0-14934","Only Blackheart's trusted are allowed in here and you're nothing of the sort. Time to die!",""
"115740052-0-14935","This portal leads to the Hollow City. We shall talk again when we are safely inside its walls.",""
"115740052-0-14936","There's another! It must be the general!",""
"115740052-0-14937","Stoke the flames of vengeance in your hearts, friends! When the weapons arrive, we fight!",""
"115740052-0-14938","Return to Daggerfall quick as you can, comrade. Sees-All-Colors must know!",""
"115740052-0-14939","Freedom. I remember this feeling. It will be fleeting though, if Molag Bal has his way.",""
"115740052-0-14940","I sense fury, fear, and folly ahead. We walk into battle. Prepare yourself.",""
"115740052-0-14941","Beware! The enemy approaches!",""
"115740052-0-14942","Nearer we draw, and yet so far to go. Do not stop now!",""
"115740052-0-14943","Rise my soldiers. Back to your bodies, and take up arms.",""
"115740052-0-14944","What have they … no, this cannot be!",""
"115740052-0-14945","Hello? Hello… is it working? Oh, there you are. Amazing! nnI think I've figured out the portal. If you have the crystals, use them to activate the pillars in the ruins. Then meet me at the west entrance to the lower ruins.",""
"115740052-0-14946","Why do you command us from the Ooze?",""
"115740052-0-14947","A powerful one, unknown to me, has stolen my bow.",""
"115740052-0-14948","Bark and birth! What have they done?",""
"115740052-0-14949","By your command ….",""
"115740052-0-14950","It's collapsing! Watch yourself!",""
"115740052-0-14951","Now your keystone removes the rest of the barrier! See where it fits?",""
"115740052-0-14952","The Dominion …. They'll doom us all!",""
"115740052-0-14953","Sithis, I implore you! Shield our unhatched eggs from the void!",""
"115740052-0-14954","This is where the bodies were rumored to have been condemned and where the General's body lay. It is rumored that he was buried with a bow of unequal value, but his army would protect it for all eternity.",""
"115740052-0-14955","Saying a line to my parent.",""
"115740052-0-14956","I think that's the last of them!",""
"115740052-0-14957","Poor Cirion. You don't want to play with your fellow Keepers?",""
"115740052-0-14958","They are not Keepers. Not any longer.",""
"115740052-0-14959","They selected an intelligent course of action. What better way to keep rickety old Rilis in check than a few Daedra? Ha ha ha!",""
"115740052-0-14960","I will find a way to silence you, Rilis. You've become too dangerous to imprison.",""
"115740052-0-14961","If you want to silence me, you'll need power like mine. Daedric magic. What is there to fear?nnI was a mere Kinlord. You are a Keeper. Surely you can resist corruption where I fell.",""
"115740052-0-14962","Stop!",""
"115740052-0-14963","Your oath is to keep me imprisoned, Keeper. What does it matter how you do it?",""
"115740052-0-14964","Be silent.",""
"115740052-0-14965","You could accomplish so much. The enemies of Auridon brought low by the power of the Keepers.",""
"115740052-0-14966","Were that I could lay my hands on you and choke the life out of you all over again.",""
"115740052-0-14967","Eh, you know, he comes and goes … oh yeah, there he is.",""
"115740052-0-14968","Cirion's right, of course. The Keepers work for my benefit, now. However, I made sure they still served their sacred stations. They'll fight you to their last breath.",""
"115740052-0-14969","You're going to fight your way through all of the Keepers? How amusing! They are stronger than they once were, you know.",""
"115740052-0-14970","Keeper Areldur watches the first stone. Let's see if she's learned from me in our time together.",""
"115740052-0-14971","Ah. That's much better. I'd say it feels like I regained the use of a limb. If I had any.",""
"115740052-0-14972","Merric ran off after some other Daedra. Get after him! Don't let her take him!",""
"115740052-0-14973","Ahaht-Ei! No!",""
"115740052-0-14974","Merric? Comrade? What happened? Where did you go?",""
"115740052-0-14975","That's a perfectly good portal. I should know, I made it!",""
"115740052-0-14976","And, for my honored guest, it's your personal doorway to continue the grand tour!",""
"115740052-0-14977","It was nothing. It was nothing.",""
"115740052-0-14978","The Daedra are resisting the ritual! Help me fend off this monster!",""
"115740052-0-14979","They're covered in so much filth, they're starting to grow together. Here, I'll show you.",""
"115740052-0-14980","Keep your boots on! We're only here until the eggs hatch.",""
"115740052-0-14981","Then the lizards get theirs, and we leave this muckwallow for good.",""
"115740052-0-14982","They're almost like the spinners from back home. Couldn't we spare them, sir?",""
"115740052-0-14983","What part of ""no survivors"" don't you understand, private? These savages are the enemy. Once they complete the ritual, they die like the rest.",""
"115740052-0-14984","But, sir!",""
"115740052-0-14985","If you're so keen to argue, talk to the Alchemist. It's his order.",""
"115740052-0-14986","Sir, I … yes, sir.",""
"115740052-0-14987","And remember, try to relax!",""
"115740052-0-14988","Mind what bumps in the night, now!",""
"115740052-0-14989","Remember, vacations are about enjoying the little moments!",""
"115740052-0-14990","Give the old lug my love before you rip his skull open, will you?",""
"115740052-0-14991","Let me help.",""
"115740052-0-14992","A near miss! Hurry, join me at the altar so that we can finish the warding ritual.",""
"115740052-0-14993","I do so enjoy fire.",""
"115740052-0-14994","I'm impressed with the Keepers. It takes a strong will to control a Daedroth of that size. nnI wonder what Daedra you could bend to your will.",""
"115740052-0-14995","Voranil lies ahead. I never liked him. He hums off-key.",""
"115740052-0-14996","How I marvel at your efficiency! You really are quite good at killing Keepers.",""
"115740052-0-14997","Give Valaste my best!",""
"115740052-0-14998","Sometimes I like to amuse myself by having my minions tear each other to pieces. The winner gets to keep fighting!",""
"115740052-0-14999","Daedric power is not granted cheaply. The Keepers are paying for their new powers with their service. To me.",""
"115740052-0-15000","Much better. Only one stone remains. This is far more entertaining than I thought it would be.",""
"115740052-0-15001","I love it when I draw this detail.  The views up here are amazing.",""
"115740052-0-15002","I find you so agreeable, in fact, that I simply must meet you in person.nnClear a path, gentlemen. Let's entertain our guests.",""
"115740052-0-15003","You've faced darkness before, adept. Remember your training.",""
"115740052-0-15004","No cheating, Shalidor! Don't ruin this for me.",""
"115740052-0-15005","Justice is a swift wind, this day. I will perform rites for the lost ones and return to <<1>>. Thank you.",""
"115740052-0-15006","How easily you slaughter Daedra and Keeper alike. How much more powerful could you be made with my gifts? You are fascinating.",""
"115740052-0-15007","Hey! Uh - I'm not doing anything!  Just - uhm - tying my boot! Yeah.",""
"115740052-0-15008","You would steal that which has already been stolen? Then enter the Shadow Wood and seek it … though you will find only death.",""
"115740052-0-15010","Right this way.",""
"115740052-0-15011","And please, try not to make a mess of things.",""
"115740052-0-15012","Happy adventuring.",""
"115740052-0-15013","I will consume you as well!",""
"115740052-0-15014","Ahh … the ebb and swell of magicka. How I missed this.",""
"115740052-0-15015","All right, let's get this started. Gol … ro … so … me-aka?",""
"115740052-0-15016","Woo hoo! Take that, you damned Elves. Wait. I just lost my place.",""
"115740052-0-15017","Alooo-saba … takeo? Takeeeo? Taco? How do you pronounce this?",""
"115740052-0-15018","All right. I think I've got it! Malla Aloo takeo!",""
"115740052-0-15019","And now my work begins.",""
"115740052-0-15020","Strike true, pig child. Don't make me wait.",""
"115740052-0-15021","Please! No! Show mercy!",""
"115740052-0-15022","Arkay, protect me. I will be with you soon.",""
"115740052-0-15023","No, wait. Please, don't kill me! Show mercy! Mercy!",""
"115740052-0-15024","Tomes! Attend me.",""
"115740052-0-15025","Now … I reclaim what was taken from me. Eyevea! Hear my call!",""
"115740052-0-15026","Monsters! You're all monsters! You'll pay for these murders!",""
"115740052-0-15027","Why? Why would you murder him? Barbaric orcs!",""
"115740052-0-15028","Turn back! The Keepers guard this tomb.",""
"115740052-0-15029","I'll see you dead before you harm this stone!",""
"115740052-0-15030","Something is wrong. I sense … Adept, Valaste. Follow me!",""
"115740052-0-15031","I never thought I'd be free of you, Blackheart.",""
"115740052-0-15032","But the day has finally come, and I'll be rewarded handsomely for this.",""
"115740052-0-15033","Raynor? Raynor! He can't hear me. Why can't he hear me? Raynor!",""
"115740052-0-15034","My new master has waited long enough, and I think it's time you died for good.nnIt's been fun, Captain. No, it hasn't.",""
"115740052-0-15035","If we let it, this darkness could suffocate you. Mage Light will fix that!",""
"115740052-0-15036","Where are you going? The temple is the other way, come back here.",""
"115740052-0-15037","Give us the cat, snake, and we'll end your life quickly.",""
"115740052-0-15038","Yeah, it's locked. Thought it'd be open, really. Sorry.",""
"115740052-0-15039","You fool! I borrowed money to buy this new sword, just because you promised treasure.",""
"115740052-0-15040","I'm not sure how much longer I … we … can go on like this. It's unbearable.",""
"115740052-0-15041","Leave the outsider alone, warm bloods! You will not harm him!",""
"115740052-0-15042","That chest. Perhaps the fork is in there.",""
"115740052-0-15043","Not another memory! My mind is full!",""
"115740052-0-15044","Are you sure we're not wasting our time? How many people has this crystal killed now?",""
"115740052-0-15045","Patience. Rest assured, Ilmyris contains the knowledge that Naemon's Shade will need.",""
"115740052-0-15046","No, the roots, they envelop the whole forest … and at the center, such pulsing … augh!",""
"115740052-0-15047","Pulsing. The heart. At last. Let me see.",""
"115740052-0-15048","Wait! What are you doing? The crystal will drive you mad!",""
"115740052-0-15049","Magnificent! Such truth, such clarity of sight. Everything leads to Hectahame….",""
"115740052-0-15050","Yes, let's talk about that sword. It's bigger than you are!",""
"115740052-0-15051","Leave it to the Daedra to fill a cave with bones and muck.",""
"115740052-0-15052","Leave it to the Daedra to make sludge out of souls. Looks like Hazim's little worse for the wear, though.",""
"115740052-0-15053","Maybe if I cut you in half with it, you'd stop laughing.",""
"115740052-0-15054","Over here! We need you!",""
"115740052-0-15055","Ha! You try to draw it and you'll fall over. I'm more likely to die of laughter than a sword thrust from you!",""
"115740052-0-15056","You have the brains of mudcrabs. Perhaps the caravan out of Dragonclaw still needs guards.",""
"115740052-0-15057","Hey! Wait for us!",""
"115740052-0-15058","Will you hold still? This illusion requires precision, which I cannot achieve with your tail constantly twitching!",""
"115740052-0-15059","My friends, you came just in time. I'm almost done.",""
"115740052-0-15060","Your blood will temper my thirst, your bones will end my famine!",""
"115740052-0-15061","Ah, you hear Merric there, at the forge. He has already begun.",""
"115740052-0-15062","This Prismatic Weapon could be a powerful force against Molag Bal, yes?",""
"115740052-0-15063","It is a difficult task we undertake today. To hunt a comrade.",""
"115740052-0-15064","Seems like we were just here, yes?",""
"115740052-0-15065","Let us summon our old friend. He will know where his murderer hides.",""
"115740052-0-15066","Damn it, cat! Can't you let an old ghost be at peace?",""
"115740052-0-15067","Not just yet, old Nord. Aelif has one more question for you. Where is Sees-All-Colors? Where does she hide?",""
"115740052-0-15068","You know I can't … I can't tell you. He holds me bound.",""
"115740052-0-15069","Tell Aelif, or she will show you what it means to be bound!",""
"115740052-0-15070","Ah! She … she sought out the Mortuum Vivicus! It's … it's in the Halls of Submission! Don't go comrades, she's ….",""
"115740052-0-15071","Enough! Aelif is up to the challenge. But don't worry, Jofnir. She will let Molag Bal know how helpful you've been.",""
"115740052-0-15072","Hmm. Very convincing. But is the illusion applied … everywhere? Perhaps this one should take a moment in private to double-check, yes?",""
"115740052-0-15073","There were no miscalulations, I assure you. Now excuse me, I must wash the smell of cat from my robes.",""
"115740052-0-15074","NYI - Giiiive ouuurrr egggs baaaack!",""
"115740052-0-15075","NYI - Your kind cannot be allowed to breed, monster!",""
"115740052-0-15076","<A blaring horn sounds.>",""
"115740052-0-15077","These swords … they must be a clue. Now where did those fools run off to?",""
"115740052-0-15078","So most of the Pact's forces have moved to Fort Amol. I'm glad I can stay here in Windhelm.",""
"115740052-0-15079","I'm still not sure how I feel about working alongside the Dark Elves and the lizard folk. Excuse me, the Argonians.",""
"115740052-0-15080","King Jorunn wants us all to work together. I hear that Prince Irnskar and the King are heading to Fort Amol shortly.",""
"115740052-0-15081","I just heard from Fort Amol. Someone tried to assassinate King Jorunn! Luckily, some stranger saved him.",""
"115740052-0-15082","Assassination! Was it one of the Dark Elves? The Argonians? I never trusted them!",""
"115740052-0-15083","It was one of Fildgor's agents. No one from the Pact would do such a thing! King Jorunn lives, but I hear he was poisoned. I pray to the Eight that he recovers.",""
"115740052-0-15084","These poor creatures. Just … slaughtered. Nothing ever changes.",""
"115740052-0-15085","Help me … destroy … the crystal ….",""
"115740052-0-15086","The council has decided we will honor the contract to fight the Daedra. Meridia continues to provide coin through her worldly servants. But we cannot allow a murderer to remain Guildmaster.",""
"115740052-0-15087","I understand.",""
"115740052-0-15088","We have decided to award you a new title. The Light of the Guild. You will advise the new Guildmaster in all matters relating to the Daedra for the rest of your days. Penance for the blood on your hands.",""
"115740052-0-15089","Thank you, Countess. I will not let you down.",""
"115740052-0-15090","You are dismissed. Merric, present yourself to the council.",""
"115740052-0-15091","Merric at-Aswala. In light of your service to the guild. In light of your sound judgement and brave heart, we cannot think of anyone more appropriate than you. You, Merric, are to be the new Guildmaster of the Fighters Guild.",""
"115740052-0-15092","It will be your responsibility to oversee completion of the contract established by Sees-All-Colors.",""
"115740052-0-15093","Remain vigilant against the forces of Molag Bal.",""
"115740052-0-15094","The Guild is a shield, a bastion for the people of Tamriel. Wear it well.",""
"115740052-0-15095","You've been quiet, Merric. What do you have to say about all this?",""
"115740052-0-15096","I … Thank you, council members. I accept this position with honor and grace. I swear to my ancestors, I will not let you down.",""
"115740052-0-15097","Now, Guildmaster, please see our friend out. We have much to discuss, and little time in which to plan. Comrade! We wish you well in your travels, and look forward to our next encounter.",""
"115740052-0-15098","Come, comrade. You can't do much good hiding in this forge. Let's get you back into the fight!",""
"115740052-0-15099","Sees-All-Colors. Present yourself to the council.",""
"115740052-0-15100","Merric at-Aswala. Present yourself to the council.",""
"115740052-0-15101","Over here!",""
"115740052-0-15102","A hidden passage. Connected to another section of the Imperial Underground, no doubt. We should investigate.",""
"115740052-0-15103","There could be some useful evidence down here. Let us look closely before moving on.",""
"115740052-0-15104","Asteril had a sister? A twin, perhaps? That would explain much. Raz suspects these tunnels will reveal the rest.",""
"115740052-0-15105","Seems that Voljar's Meadery has been shut down.",""
"115740052-0-15106","What? They make the finest mead in Eastmarch. What happened?",""
"115740052-0-15107","No one knows for sure, but Stormfists were seen in the area. The place appears to be shut down.",""
"115740052-0-15108","I was just at the Sober Nord, enjoying the newest beverage from Voljar's Meadery.",""
"115740052-0-15109","Oh? I thought the place had been closed down.",""
"115740052-0-15110","It's open for business again, though now five brothers are running the place.",""
"115740052-0-15111","Have you heard? The Stormfists have captured Cradlecrush, an old Orc stronghold.",""
"115740052-0-15112","That old place? Next you'll tell me it's raining dogs. Have you been drinking?",""
"115740052-0-15113","Well, yes, I'm always drinking. But I heard that from someone sober.",""
"115740052-0-15114","Fildgor's Stormfists no longer hold Cradlecrush. Giants drove them out.",""
"115740052-0-15115","Really? That's unusual. Normally the giants keep to themselves.",""
"115740052-0-15116","The Stormfist were stupid enough to steal their mammoths. I heard a brave champion helped them defeat Lob the Cleaver to win the day.",""
"115740052-0-15117","Keep your eyes open and your weapon ready. The shadows here are not your friend.",""
"115740052-0-15118","Onward!",""
"115740052-0-15119","More outsiders! Show them the penalty for entering the Moonless Walk!",""
"115740052-0-15120","Come, outsider! While they are distracted, we shall find a safer place!",""
"115740052-0-15121","You've done it, comrade!",""
"115740052-0-15122","The lizard put you up to this? I'll eat her young!",""
"115740052-0-15123","They're the last of their kind! Join me! We'll have a feast!",""
"115740052-0-15124","Not over! Friends going to … eat all of … stupid lizards! After ritual … you'll see!",""
"115740052-0-15125","That door has a barrier? It didn't when I last came through here. Let's look around, there must be a way to disrupt it.",""
"115740052-0-15126","Turn back, or <<1>> will die at your hands!",""
"115740052-0-15127","Zur told you our friend would find us, Gadris. You worry too much.",""
"115740052-0-15128","Zur thinks he saw some dried scathecraw over here … yes, here it is!",""
"115740052-0-15129","Ah, Zur's finest potion yet! You will drink it now, yes?",""
"115740052-0-15130","I will help the Khajiit, Elf! I know the best way into the tower!",""
"115740052-0-15131","Don't be ridiculous, snake! The Khajiit needs expert help, and that means I'm going to provide it.",""

"115740052-0-15133","Wait, outsider, a moment more of your time.",""
"115740052-0-15134","Leave <<1>> for now. We have to disrupt the summoning ritual! I'll destroy the bone piles if you keep the undead at bay.",""

"115740052-0-15136","Run to the gates! You'll be safe there!",""
"115740052-0-15137","Make a run for the gate. They'll protect you.",""
"115740052-0-15138","We're pushing back the Maormer. Run for the gate!",""
"115740052-0-15139","Run to the gates. The guards will protect you.",""
"115740052-0-15140","Hang in there, <<1>>. We'll be right back after we deal with the horns.",""
"115740052-0-15141","Damn the Maormer… At least <<1>> died a warrior's death.",""
"115740052-0-15142","Where are you going?",""
"115740052-0-15143","Bowenas is gone! Someone took her!",""

"115740052-0-15149","<<1>>, murdered? These treacherous Khajiit have plotted with the Maormer to slay our noble envoy!",""
"115740052-0-15150","How dare you! <<1>> was our guest. You go too far, Vicereeve!",""
"115740052-0-15151","Outrageous! More Dominion treachery. I will conduct my own investigation!",""
"115740052-0-15152","No sea-rat will show me up. I'll get to the bottom of this myself!",""
"115740052-0-15153","Speak with me a moment, comrade.",""
"115740052-0-15154","Hsst! Quick, over here!",""
"115740052-0-15155","Follow me. The exit is this way.",""
"115740052-0-15156","Grab a weapon from one of those racks, there could be more lurking about!",""
"115740052-0-15157","You're too late! The Stonefire burns brightly! The Dro-m'Athra are unbound and they shall destroy you!",""
"115740052-0-15158","These things crawled out of a hole on the western side of the fort.",""

"115740052-0-15246","Tell us what you're doing here. Who is behind the attack on Arenthia?",""
"115740052-0-15247","The truth, Centurion. Or your life.",""
"115740052-0-15248","We are in league with the Stonefire cult.",""

"115740052-0-15266","Hey! A little help here!",""
"115740052-0-15267","Are you all right? I was sent by the Mages Guild to help.",""
"115740052-0-15268","Please, Father! There must be some way!",""
"115740052-0-15269","I know. I'm the one who sent for you. Did me a whole lot of good.",""
"115740052-0-15270","The Vestige awakens, once again. Come here, we must speak.",""
"115740052-0-15271","You must accept this, Talia. My time has come. Go … prepare the potion. I must speak with our guest.",""
"115740052-0-15272","I do not like this, but I will do as you say, Father.",""
"115740052-0-15273","You cannot stop the Shadow Wood. It is an inevitability.",""
"115740052-0-15274","Leave the shadow rifts alone, or you will suffer for it.",""
"115740052-0-15275","Desist, living one! You meddle with forces you cannot understand.",""
"115740052-0-15276","You go too far. Now you will experience the Shadow Wood for yourself!",""
"115740052-0-15277","You! I won't wear a poisoned outfit.",""
"115740052-0-15278","Leave it to an Altmer to grasp for power and sow disaster. I would have been able to keep these Daedra under control.nnIf these shaveskins have harmed my sister, I will unclaw them.",""
"115740052-0-15279","This one knew she was alive! Bakkhara is close, I have her scent. This will be easier than I thought.nnPerhaps I can save my sister and return home with a cadre of Daedric servants, as well.",""
"115740052-0-15280","Look at all these Daedra. They would be a force to be reckoned with under the banner of the Mages Guild ….",""
"115740052-0-15281","<<1>>'s memory has more holes than the fleet. Come with Raz, friend. We should speak.",""
"115740052-0-15282","The <<z:1>> moistens my paw. Raz does not like the texture.",""
"115740052-0-15283","Yes, it's as Raz thought. The commander must know.",""
"115740052-0-15284","My sister's scent ends here, at this portal. The altar that keeps it open must just be beyond. You stay here.",""
"115740052-0-15285","Come closer.",""
"115740052-0-15286","Look what they've done to our home! Rip them apart!",""
"115740052-0-15287","Sameer … Sameer … rouse yourself! Or do you want to miss the battle?",""
"115740052-0-15288","Bera, notify the guild council. Tell them we'll meet them here upon our return.",""
"115740052-0-15289","Ra Gada! You all know that the Elves are outside our walls. These … infidels call us barbarians. They would drive us from this land.",""
"115740052-0-15290","But what the Elves do not know … is that Ruptga himself guided us to these shores! He decreed that the Alik'r would be our home!",""
"115740052-0-15291","Today, the infidels will see the strength of the Shehai! Onsi will guide our blades! Today, the sands will run red with Elven blood!",""
"115740052-0-15292","An impressive tactic.",""
"115740052-0-15293","More constructs!",""
"115740052-0-15294","Surely, this must be the last.",""
"115740052-0-15295","An Auroran? Here?",""
"115740052-0-15296","Order's up, Gil!",""
"115740052-0-15297","Do you need anything, Salori?",""
"115740052-0-15298","Halt! Come no closer!",""
"115740052-0-15299","I'm fine. Just reading.",""
"115740052-0-15300","Sure thing. Call me if you need me.",""
"115740052-0-15301","Are you still waiting?",""
"115740052-0-15302","Yes. She's late as usual. Can I get some more water?",""
"115740052-0-15303","Certainly. Be right back.",""
"115740052-0-15304","Then let us not keep him waiting.",""
"115740052-0-15305","How's everyone doing over here?",""
"115740052-0-15306","Pork for me and another drink for Riahl. And a new personality for Blodrat, please!",""
"115740052-0-15307","I will fight today in your honor, father.",""
"115740052-0-15308","Ah, much better! Now, follow me out of this foul place! Then we can talk.",""
"115740052-0-15309","You'll make it out of here, I know you will.",""
"115740052-0-15310","Food and drink coming right up. Can't help Blodrat though.",""
"115740052-0-15311","Keep up the jokes, Farisel. You'll be wearing that chair soon.",""
"115740052-0-15312","There's only one more chamber where they could be hiding my son. The fight will be bloody. You all served me well, my friends. If you leave now, I will think no less of you.",""
"115740052-0-15313","Come on, boss, you think we'd really walk out on you now? Who knows? Dying might be an adventure! Right, Faulor?",""
"115740052-0-15314","We all love At'avar. Everything between him and us dies.",""
"115740052-0-15315","Thank you my friends. And you, outsiders, I already owe too much. But I hope you'll join us for this last push.",""
"115740052-0-15316","Finally! <<1>> will find this fabled brush.",""
"115740052-0-15317","I'm goin' out!",""
"115740052-0-15318","What? What is this?",""
"115740052-0-15319","Hmm, you have such intricate stitching ….",""
"115740052-0-15320","Please, no! This one will stop looking!",""
"115740052-0-15321","I tire of this. Leave or die, it matters not.",""
"115740052-0-15322","That can't be good. We need to get those wards down, fast!",""
"115740052-0-15323","<A distant war horn sounds.>",""
"115740052-0-15324","We've got work to do.",""
"115740052-0-15325","A little less noticeable now. Follow me.",""
"115740052-0-15326","Go, help my master! I'm right behind you.",""
"115740052-0-15327","<<1>>! Get out of my body, now!",""
"115740052-0-15328","Silence! None command <<1>>!",""
"115740052-0-15329","Stay back!",""
"115740052-0-15330","The champion is dead! Let's return to the camp where your friend was killed. There's a portal stone there that we can use to reach the council.",""
"115740052-0-15331","Great rescue, but now what? Do you have a plan or are we making this up as we go along?",""
"115740052-0-15332","You've had enough, Verene. Time for you to go.",""
"115740052-0-15333","All right. I'm leavin'. Be back later.",""
"115740052-0-15334","See you there!",""
"115740052-0-15335","I'll return shortly. You'll be safe here, I promise. Why not get to know a few of these Shadow Walkers while I'm gone.",""
"115740052-0-15336","Jellyfish? Ah, Shalar is a silly one.",""
"115740052-0-15337","<<1>>, another strange <<z:2>>. Recruit, show the commander what you found.",""
"115740052-0-15338","Can't make it up ladder. Goin' to sleep on floor.",""
"115740052-0-15339","I don't have time to play with trinkets, Raz. <<1>> will know what to do with this.",""
"115740052-0-15340","You think they are one and the same, then?",""
"115740052-0-15341","At first glance, yes. Exciting, isn't it?",""
"115740052-0-15342","Let's talk somewhere more … private. There, in that tower.",""
"115740052-0-15343","Good news! The council has agreed to meet with you!",""
"115740052-0-15344","At last! This book had best be worth the price.",""
"115740052-0-15345","We would have been if that stranger hadn't arrived. Honestly, what good is a town guard if they refuse to protect their people?",""
"115740052-0-15346","Their ancestors were eating people, Firouz! Gods you're naive!",""
"115740052-0-15347","They were protecting the people - our honored dead deserve to be guarded just as we do.  Would you have the soldiers cut down their ancestors like jackals?",""
"115740052-0-15348","By Tava's red feathers, I thought we were going to be overrun.",""
"115740052-0-15349","We shouldn't go outdoors, Firouz. The dead may have already reached the city.",""
"115740052-0-15350","We would have heard something. They make a noise. Its… I do not even want to think about it.",""
"115740052-0-15351","If we move quickly, we might be able to make it to Farrokh's house.",""
"115740052-0-15352","Sometimes blessings aren't enough, Bahbiq.",""
"115740052-0-15353","I do not understand.  The vault was thrice-blessed by Ruptga.",""
"115740052-0-15354","Amen.",""
"115740052-0-15355","To Oblivion with this Withered Hand! Dogs and sons of dogs, all of them.",""
"115740052-0-15356","Well may this blessing carry: Tall Papa, watch over Fahara'jad's champion, and may all his enemies eat sand.",""
"115740052-0-15357","My father would not want us to surrender!",""
"115740052-0-15358","What? What is that?",""
"115740052-0-15359","Keep to your feet.",""

"115740052-0-15362","I don't like this.",""
"115740052-0-15363","Have to agree with the elf, boss. There's some serious magic here. This place screams 'ambush'.",""
"115740052-0-15364","Ambush. What a lovely idea.",""
"115740052-0-15365","Whew! Harder than expected. Let's see if it was worth it.",""
"115740052-0-15366","My favorite spot on this island. You see why?",""
"115740052-0-15367","Gods be good. I'm saved.",""
"115740052-0-15368","Come quickly then. Meet me at my tent in the camp!",""
"115740052-0-15369","Not now. Not ever!",""
"115740052-0-15370","Here. I've marked on your map where my father says we can find the ingredients. Lead the way!",""
"115740052-0-15371","Now you die, mortal!",""

"115740052-0-15425","Just what I said. There's no more room.",""
"115740052-0-15426","You've got room for that drunken wench but not for an honest Orc?",""
"115740052-0-15427","Go try your luck at the Oak and Crosier. I've got no room here, for Orcs or anyone else.",""

"115740052-0-15456","Excellent! Head down to the holding cells and free my companions. I'll guard our way out of here.",""

"115740052-0-15465","The Shadow Watch has grown too powerful and too aggressive.",""
"115740052-0-15466","Too aggressive? You haven't seen aggressive. We will cut down every last one of you!",""
"115740052-0-15467","Light it up.",""
"115740052-0-15468","They cast a shield spell on the gate! We're trapped!",""

"115740052-0-15482","Malarel, why don't you call one of your friends to help you? I'll allow it.",""

"115740052-0-15495","On my way!",""
"115740052-0-15496","And now, the final contender in the qualifying rounds of the Sorcerer Division Championship!",""
"115740052-0-15497","She hails from darkest Valenwood!",""

"115740052-0-15510","The next combatant, a mystical mer of unknown origin!",""
"115740052-0-15511","He claims to come from a subterranean realm in the depths of Nirn itself!",""
"115740052-0-15512","Here he is, folks … Norirtil the Nefarious!",""
"115740052-0-15513","Norirtil will be returned to the earth from which he came!",""

"115740052-0-15516","Who dares disturb my slumber?",""
"115740052-0-15517","You'll never best my generals!",""
"115740052-0-15518","A lucky feat, mortal. The staff is still mine.",""
"115740052-0-15519","Insect! You will never hold the staff. Never!",""
"115740052-0-15520","The staff is mine!",""
"115740052-0-15521","My my, you people certainly are eager to die ….",""
"115740052-0-15522","My life for Maleel!",""
"115740052-0-15523","You'll never reach Maleel!",""
"115740052-0-15524","You've already lost! While you charged in, we went behind and killed your king! Ha!",""
"115740052-0-15525","Someone's inside. They said this place would be deserted!",""
"115740052-0-15526","No one here. Perfect.",""
"115740052-0-15527","As good a place as any. If that clerk has any sense, he'll find it.",""
"115740052-0-15528","This is Line 1 of Conversation 1.",""

"115740052-0-15531","Been looking forward to this all … who in Oblivion are you?",""
"115740052-0-15532","You have been judged! You won't escape!",""
"115740052-0-15533","I'll execute you myself!",""
"115740052-0-15534","So, why do we even have a Mages Guild here?",""
"115740052-0-15535","The king thinks it's important, I suppose … keeping up appearances for the rest of the Covenant.",""
"115740052-0-15536","Is it true what people say? About the banekin dancing atop the tower at night?",""
"115740052-0-15537","I heard there's a High Elf in there who eats nothing but fire salts all day long.",""
"115740052-0-15538","Our deeds today will be remembered for generations to come, brother. Lead on!",""
"115740052-0-15539","Morwha's bosom! Let us give the tower a wide berth, shall we?",""
"115740052-0-15540","I'm afraid so. My brother said he saw a man turned into a monkey just by walking in the tower's shadow.",""
"115740052-0-15541","Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Swordmaster Arena and the qualifying rounds of the Swordmaster Division Championships!",""

"115740052-0-15543","And all the way from Daggerfall, the Sabre of Salvation! The Cutlass of Caring! Here he is … Mirten!",""
"115740052-0-15544","Mirten has fallen! The Mysterious Stranger has taken Round One!",""
"115740052-0-15545","And now, on to Round Two!",""
"115740052-0-15546","Our next contender was once expelled from the Vinedusk Rangers for her overzealous ferocity!",""
"115740052-0-15547","You may know her as the Lightning Knife, the Shocking Striker, or the Thunderbug!",""
"115740052-0-15548","But we know her as … Thael the Impaler!",""
"115740052-0-15549","Thael the Impaler has been eliminated!",""
"115740052-0-15550","Did you hear that? They must have gone through the crypt! Quickly! We must stop them!",""
"115740052-0-15551","And now. The third and final qualification round!",""
"115740052-0-15552","Our next challenger is a fearsome opponent from Rawl'kha!",""
"115740052-0-15553","Her blade may appear blunt, but it is heavy enough to sever limbs from torsos!",""
"115740052-0-15554","This must be the source of the Daedra. You must stop it, whatever it is. Bakkhara's claws have been unsharpened.",""
"115740052-0-15555","Ladies and gentlemen, I give you … Rayfa the Reaper!",""
"115740052-0-15556","Rayfa is down! We have a new challenger for the main arena! The Mysterious Stranger!",""
"115740052-0-15557","You mentioned Dwemer ruins in your message. Where might they be?",""
"115740052-0-15558","Further down the tunnels, beyond the door. That's where the kwama first broke through.",""
"115740052-0-15559","We have to get there. I'd like to see those ruins.",""
"115740052-0-15560","My son … you failed me. Now, you will die!",""
"115740052-0-15561","Another sacrifice? How delicous. Let's see if you're strong enough to become one of my pet thralls.",""
"115740052-0-15562","Please … hurry … one of us must be saved ….",""
"115740052-0-15563","Pack your things, wife. We are going back to Bergama.",""
"115740052-0-15564","But my husband, we have just arrived! I cannot bear another journey across the sands so near to the birth.",""
"115740052-0-15565","We have no choice, my love. Ra-Netu are emerging from the waves. We aren't safe here.",""
"115740052-0-15566","Tu'whacca preserve us.",""
"115740052-0-15567","Peace, Jalinah. Save your tears to water our grapes. Now quickly, prepare your things.",""
"115740052-0-15568","The lighting—it burns! Keep away from me!",""
"115740052-0-15570","Ah, there you are. I'm glad this works. I have good news for you.",""
"115740052-0-15571","As I have told you repeatedly, the king is occupied. Governing.",""
"115740052-0-15572","Yes, but as I said, High King Emeric has sent me here with vital news concerning the war effort.",""
"115740052-0-15573","…I simply must speak to the king at His Majesty's earliest convenience.",""
"115740052-0-15574","In this place, the only king you need concern yourself with is the thrice-blessed Fahara'jad, Tava's blessings be upon him. nnI'm afraid the immediate crisis at the docks takes precedence.",""
"115740052-0-15575","Amazing! Do you know what this is? This is Rkugamz!",""
"115740052-0-15576","Give me a minute to catch my breath.",""
"115740052-0-15577","I have no doubt that these ruins are Rkugamz. The physical ailments we've seen could have been caused by the legendary Engine. If we find it and disable it, the ruins should be safe to traverse.",""
"115740052-0-15578","Raz, you old mouser! Where's that rescue party I ordered?",""
"115740052-0-15579","You're not Razum. Where is he? We've got a prisoner to interrogate.",""
"115740052-0-15580","What is all this water? Can't we have one dry spot in this place?",""
"115740052-0-15581","Some Maormer magic. We caught one spying and brought him in for questioning.",""
"115740052-0-15582","Hey! Stranger! Come here. I may be able to help you.",""
"115740052-0-15583","You won't get anything from me, shore-scum!",""
"115740052-0-15584","Hrr. Seems the shipwrecks may be in danger as well. Let's talk somewhere drier.",""
"115740052-0-15585","You think you can steal from the Crosstree Bandits?",""
"115740052-0-15586","Walk away. The Crosstree Bandits won't stand for competition.",""
"115740052-0-15587","By the Divines, what is that noise?",""
"115740052-0-15588","Why would they attack us? Don't they know we're here to help?",""
"115740052-0-15589","Something has altered these kwama. I've never seen anything like it. They're as aggressive as the miners ….",""
"115740052-0-15590","We are doomed if we stay here.",""
"115740052-0-15591","Spirits? Bah.",""
"115740052-0-15592","Ladies and gentlemen. Fiends and friends. We now present the main event!",""
"115740052-0-15593","No doubt, you've heard our contender's name mentioned with awe and respect. The Mysterious Stranger, champion of all three arena divisions, has issued a challenge to duel for the Grand Championship!",""
"115740052-0-15594","I am excited to announce that this challenge has been accepted by the reigning champion!",""
"115740052-0-15595","Without further ado, here to defend her title as the Grand Champion of Thizzrini Arena …!",""
"115740052-0-15596","Please give a warm welcome to … Ishalga, the Queen of Pain!",""
"115740052-0-15597","Sweet Mara, look at them … someone's going to have to fight through that.",""
"115740052-0-15598","Your winning streak is over! Ishalga will paint these walls with your blood!",""
"115740052-0-15599","Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new Grand Champion! Give a big cheer for … The Mysterious Stranger!",""
"115740052-0-15600","You're too late.",""
"115740052-0-15601","Now, quickly, destroy the crown. Place it in the furnace. Burn that abomination. For the Queen and the Dominion!",""
"115740052-0-15602","I'll require accomodations for myself and my aide. You'll provide them, of course?",""
"115740052-0-15603","Erm … that will not be necessary. Khajiiti fare is too … cultural for my palate.",""
"115740052-0-15604","Naturally. Will you be dining with us, as well?",""
"115740052-0-15605","If we kill the challenger, Ishalga said we can keep the skooma. It's worth a fortune!",""
"115740052-0-15606","There they are! Get them!",""
"115740052-0-15607","I told you!",""
"115740052-0-15608","What was that?",""
"115740052-0-15609","I'll burn down the forest! You hear me spirits?",""
"115740052-0-15610","No! Let us go. I'll lead my tribe back to Shrouded Vale!",""
"115740052-0-15611","I'm being foolish…",""
"115740052-0-15612","You there, come here.",""
"115740052-0-15613","We did not expect you so soon, <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-15614","One must arrive early to see the truth of things.",""
"115740052-0-15615","The truth? But we have nothing to hide, Inspector.",""
"115740052-0-15616","I hear that often, Clan Mother. Far too often.",""
"115740052-0-15617","The great storm was not kind to us. Still, we have the matter in hand.",""
"115740052-0-15618","I can't help but notice the abundance of vermin about, Clan Mother.",""
"115740052-0-15619","Do you?",""
"115740052-0-15620","Indeed, we brought in a specialist. This one assures you, Inspector, the matter will be resolved shortly.",""
"115740052-0-15621","Will you be staying with us long, Inspector?",""
"115740052-0-15622","As long as necessary. One can only tolerate so much fresh air.",""
"115740052-0-15623","Truly? Then we'll endeavor to make your stay comfortable.",""
"115740052-0-15624","Don't fret overmuch. If my duty requires it, I can tolerate such … rustic accomodations.",""
"115740052-0-15625","I'm telling the others!",""
"115740052-0-15626","Clan Mother, tell me your thoughts on the skooma trade.",""
"115740052-0-15627","Moon sugar is more than a spice, to some of us. Using it to brew skooma is an abomination.",""
"115740052-0-15628","Then you would have no idea who might supply such an operation …?",""
"115740052-0-15629","None in this one's employ. We want nothing to do with skooma, Inspector. If we learn any of our customers brew the stuff, you'll be the first to know.",""

"115740052-0-15848","I did it. The Great Shackle has been shattered! The threat of the Planemeld is no more!",""
"115740052-0-15849","Enough! We can discuss this back in the Hollow City. I'll open a portal before this entire place collapses on top of us!",""
"115740052-0-15850","You dare interfere in my master's plans?",""
"115740052-0-15851","You saved me! I'm sorry, but I need to run. I have to find the others!",""
"115740052-0-15852","Such an interesting mortal.",""
"115740052-0-15853","Your assistance might be just what I require.",""
"115740052-0-15854","Foolish mortal. He escaped to my sanctum, but he cannot escape his fate.",""

"115740052-0-15859","We shall see, Treeminder. We shall see.",""
"115740052-0-15860","I should never have left this place.",""
"115740052-0-15861","And just where did you think you were going, Glorwin?",""
"115740052-0-15862","Talk to Hautt and Hridi. Perhaps they remember where they hid the lute and daggers.",""
"115740052-0-15863","I suppose that sheds a little light on the Soul Shriven. We should keep an eye out for other notes lying around the tower.",""
"115740052-0-15864","If you would follow me.",""
"115740052-0-15865","As you can see, our artisans have built some small amount of civilization amidst this barbaric wilderness.",""

"115740052-0-15868","The local Bosmer are disorganized and flighty. Such outbursts usually fizzle out of their own accord.",""
"115740052-0-15869","Ah, the Mages Guild. If you would follow me inside.",""
"115740052-0-15870","The Bandit's reign of terror ends today!",""

"115740052-0-15886","Behold, the Mages Guild. The paint is still fresh. A marvelous addition to the city.",""
"115740052-0-15887","Work remains, of course, but one does what one must on the fringes of the Dominion.",""
"115740052-0-15888","The vault is below. Follow me.",""
"115740052-0-15889","Puny, wingless, mortal fools! I'll feast on your flesh after my little pet rips it from your bones!",""
"115740052-0-15890","You killed my darling creature! I'll tear out your hearts and serve them to my father on a silver platter!",""
"115740052-0-15891","Don't … don't let it take me! No!",""
"115740052-0-15892","It was all … worth it.",""
"115740052-0-15893","Pardon me. I would speak with you.",""

"115740052-0-15896","Help me collect honey from the hives on this side of the island and I'll put beautiful flowers on your grave.",""
"115740052-0-15897","I miss this place. I should have never left.",""
"115740052-0-15898","We have to get to the bottom of this.",""
"115740052-0-15899","The fact that Jofnir's killer is still out there is unacceptable.",""

"115740052-0-15920","I understand your concerns but think of the potential rewards. These woods have long been rumored to house a powerful forest spirit.",""
"115740052-0-15921","Well, that's ominous …",""
"115740052-0-15922","There is something off about these Bosmer. Something wild. Feral. Are you sure they just won't attack us?",""
"115740052-0-15923","I agree with the Apprentice. How are we to get past these Bosmer if they try to stop us?",""
"115740052-0-15924","One more adjustment … there! Now I can draw even more energy from the mage!",""
"115740052-0-15925","We have visitors it seems. Perhaps they can be of assistance.",""
"115740052-0-15926","There you are! Things are getting a bit strange inside the Flagon.",""
"115740052-0-15927","Regardless of what he's told you, Magistrate, Istah and his bailiffs have made no progress in their investigation.",""
"115740052-0-15928","Our work is finished. Let us return to Longhaven.",""
"115740052-0-15929","Captain Ethrel, look at me, we're going to make it through this.",""
"115740052-0-15930","Captain … Captain! Damn it all.",""
"115740052-0-15931","Honestly, I'm more worried about the Withered Hand than these disappearances, Councilman. We just have to give Istah more time.",""
"115740052-0-15932","That should be all of them. Good work.",""
"115740052-0-15933","I don't know. Bailiff Fakimal—the one who lives at the northwest edge of town—I heard he was ignoring evidence in the case.",""
"115740052-0-15934","We can't believe everything we hear. You have my word though, if necessary, I will deal with Istah.",""
"115740052-0-15935","The person behind the disappearances is definitely a Crown. No doubt about it.",""
"115740052-0-15936","Because there were shreds of a Crown dishdasha left at one of the crime scenes.",""
"115740052-0-15937","Now that's low, even for you. How could you possibly know that?",""
"115740052-0-15938","Are the bailiffs covering that up? This is the first I've heard of it.",""
"115740052-0-15939","Strange winged beasts—pets of the vampires … or were they once Bosmer themselves?",""
"115740052-0-15940","The web-weavers make fitting companions for the vampires and their enthralling mist.",""
"115740052-0-15941","Our brother Istah has not visited the fellowship house much of late.",""
"115740052-0-15942","Truly? What possible reason would the guards have for keeping out a bailiff?",""
"115740052-0-15943","No, but one of the bailiffs was here. Believe it or not, the guards almost didn't let him in.",""
"115740052-0-15944","His Crown dishdasha was all shredded up. I suppose it happened when he arrested someone. I just gave him a new one.",""
"115740052-0-15945","Your mug is empty. How can you resist the fragrant aroma of the Everfull's Special Blend?",""
"115740052-0-15946","You draw your sword when you're frightened, Khali. Just like when you were a little girl.",""
"115740052-0-15947","This vault holds many rare plants that no longer exist in the Summerset Isles. Do take a closer look. I am no scholar of botany, but I know something about our specimens.",""
"115740052-0-15948","Mother? Is that you?",""
"115740052-0-15949","Even as a cub, you were filled with such anger. After I died, that anger grew. Now, you laugh and curse in turn.",""
"115740052-0-15950","Mother, Namu … we lost you so long ago. And you were gone so much. Why are you here?",""
"115740052-0-15951","Hey! Are you down there? I need to speak to you!",""
"115740052-0-15952","I know, Khali. But you and Shazah had each other. A bond that transcends your rage. Now, face your past. Face my rage. Pray at the lunar shrines.",""
"115740052-0-15953","Wait! Don't go!",""
"115740052-0-15954","Justice Istah. You are hereby found guilty of obstructing an investigation, and conspiring against the people of Bergama.",""
"115740052-0-15955","This room holds Ayleid relics uncovered across Valenwood. Interesting, aren't they?nnWe've removed any dormant traps, that we know of, so feel free to examine them more closely. I will answer any questions you have about them.",""
"115740052-0-15956","The promised one has finally arrived. The Light of Meridia is yours to claim. With it, you can finally set me free.",""
"115740052-0-15957","I do not know from where these charges originate, Magistrate, but I am innocent. You will see. The truth will come to light.",""
"115740052-0-15958","You will remain here until a thorough investigation has been completed. I am sorry, Istah.",""
"115740052-0-15959","Mane Akkhuz-ri, it is a pleasure to meet you. The Khajiit and their faith will be the Dominion's bulwark against the darkness.",""
"115740052-0-15960","Thank you, my Queen. May the Bright Moons guide us in our new endeavor.",""
"115740052-0-15961","Behold. The Staff of Magnus.",""
"115740052-0-15962","Glad you made it. Just hold the keys up to the pillars and we'll be on our way.",""
"115740052-0-15963","What? What happened? Where is it?",""
"115740052-0-15964","This must be the main ""living"" quarters. Faenir must be near. At last, my prey is within reach.",""
"115740052-0-15965","Come on you dogs! We need to get this load of bodies out of here. Alasan is waiting.",""
"115740052-0-15966","So that explains what we saw as we slew them. They bound themselves to the skull. Dark magic often comes with a heavy price.",""
"115740052-0-15967","Chosen of Marbruk, your queen has arrived! Present yourselves!",""
"115740052-0-15968","Bear witness to the glory of Queen Ayrenn, hope of the Dominon!",""
"115740052-0-15969","Our ticket's up. Ladies first!",""
"115740052-0-15970","This one is no lady.",""
"115740052-0-15971","No! We must treat with them!",""
"115740052-0-15972","That should do it. If that doesn't get my clan's attention, nothing will. Now let's get the head of the champion and get out of here!",""
"115740052-0-15973","So this is the outsider that Faraniel has been dragging around the forest? Interesting.",""
"115740052-0-15974","Let me handle the talking. I have a way with words.",""
"115740052-0-15975","My woodland friends, I come with good tidings from the Mages Guild. We seek a relationship of mutual learning.",""
"115740052-0-15976","My friends, there is no need for weapons. We come in peace!",""
"115740052-0-15977","The maiden has decreed that you have no place here! You'll feed the earth tonight.",""
"115740052-0-15978","You knocked down an old man!",""
"115740052-0-15979","I've had just about enough of this.",""
"115740052-0-15980","Kill them! Take the relics!",""
"115740052-0-15981","I think everyone needs a drink. How about some more mead!",""
"115740052-0-15982","Jone and Jode, you have shown the way to Rid-Thar-ri'Datta. This one is your humble servant.",""
"115740052-0-15983","By your light this one will lead his people. By your light will this one imbue balance to the Khajiit.",""
"115740052-0-15984","Jone and Jode have spoken. Shazah, Khali … you were both born beneath the same moon. Never before has this happened. Never before have the Bright Moons gifted us this way. Forevermore you will be known as the ""Lunar Champions.""",""
"115740052-0-15985","We … we understand. The Mane is strong, and we are … we are new.",""
"115740052-0-15986","Yes, we understand. We're an embarrassment! We didn't ask for this. We were born this way, moons-be-damned!",""
"115740052-0-15987","You're <<1>>'s ally, yes? Please, disable these traps so she can make it to us safely.",""
"115740052-0-15988","We've seen you fraternizing with those Crown curs. Be cautious. You may well be their next victim.",""
"115740052-0-15989","Fair winds and blessings, wayfarer. War may come between Crown and Forebear eventually, but it shall not begin in Bergama thanks to you.",""

"115740052-0-15991","Hail <gender tag>. Are you new to Bergama? I've not seen you at the gatherings. Things here are grim indeed. Crown dogs are abducting our brothers — it is likely that they have been slain in secret. Remain vigilant.",""
"115740052-0-15992","By Tava's red feathers, I am glad we did not take up the blade too soon <gender tag>. These Crowns are foolish, and arrogant, and intransigent — but it does my heart good to know that they are not cold-blooded murderers.",""
"115740052-0-15993","We have been trying to transplant this unusual variety of Redwort plant into Summerset for some time.",""
"115740052-0-15994","We found these in a Valenwood cave, of all places.",""
"115740052-0-15995","Crimson Nirnroot. We thought it was a Nord tall-tale.",""
"115740052-0-15996","Alchemists pay a dear price for this plant. It will be the jewel of the royal gardens.",""
"115740052-0-15997","The moon shiens down upon you. You are ready to continue along the path. I shall unlock the door. I shall meet you on the other side.",""
"115740052-0-15998","Scholars believe this relic was broken into pieces when it fell from the heavens. They believe there may be others in Hectahame, the legendary center of Valenwood.",""
"115740052-0-15999","This helm is actually from our own collection, but one of our Bosmer … allies … stole it, and then returned it in exchange for a song.",""

"115740052-0-16001","Sir Cadwell came through again! That crazy knight is starting to grow on me. Should I be worried?",""
"115740052-0-16002","This should do it!",""
"115740052-0-16003","Hello again! Need a way out?",""
"115740052-0-16004","It's not much further.",""
"115740052-0-16005","You must be the ugliest princess ever rescued from a tower, Tharn.",""
"115740052-0-16006","We don't want any more mead! Get out of here!",""
"115740052-0-16007","All right, there should be a grate that leads out into town over there. I'll follow you from here on out.",""
"115740052-0-16008","Shor's bones! We've been deceived!",""
"115740052-0-16009","That was less than dignified. We will have words, recruit.",""
"115740052-0-16010","Your souls are mine! You may as well drink up and accept your fate.",""
"115740052-0-16011","I want to hear you beg or I'll cut off the supply of Special Blend!",""

"115740052-0-16036","What is it, father?",""
"115740052-0-16037","I need to get this off my chest. I made the deal that doomed us. I made the bargain with the Daedric Prince.",""

"115740052-0-16045","I made it!",""
"115740052-0-16046","What? You made the ground soggy?",""
"115740052-0-16047","The island. I made this little island!",""
"115740052-0-16048","What? Ara, what do you mean you made it?",""
"115740052-0-16049","These trees, those rocks, none of this was here yesterday. The ground is wet because I used my magic to pull it up from under the water.",""
"115740052-0-16050","Oh, Ara. What have you done?",""
"115740052-0-16051","Mother? What's wrong? Why are you walking away?",""
"115740052-0-16052","Over here.",""
"115740052-0-16053","Oh good, another projection of Tharn! Maybe if we ignore him he'll go away.",""
"115740052-0-16054","Over there.",""
"115740052-0-16055","We have a prisoner. Perhaps he can shed some light on where we can find this forest spirit.",""
"115740052-0-16056","This must be where I am to meet my guide.",""
"115740052-0-16057","So they killed Ahainar-jo? His death will not be a hollow one. We've managed to capture a prisoner.",""
"115740052-0-16058","Hey! What're you messing with up there?",""
"115740052-0-16060","Not very big, is it? Oh well. Now, cast the ritual from the book.",""

"115740052-0-16068","Seems like no matter who's in charge mages aren't appreciated.",""

"115740052-0-16070","No, it's worse now. One of those drunken brutes almost broke my arm yesterday.",""
"115740052-0-16071","The Hunt … it's turned them. This never would have happened if the Dominion had stayed intact! Damn the eagle banner!",""

"115740052-0-16084","Fardel was never far from this mug. After the death of his wife to plague, he found comfort only in drink. He was loved and supported, but never escaped the darkness. He lived a life of quiet melancholy. Graccus ended that quiet. Ended everything.",""

"115740052-0-16169","So that's the last Ayleid, huh? I thought he'd be more … dusty. Isn't that what happens when Elves get really, really old?",""

"115740052-0-16244","The Great Shackle has been destroyed, but not before a planar vortex was established. We must destroy this vortex before it sucks the very essences of Nirn into Coldharbour.",""
"115740052-0-16245","The Fighters Guild shall deal with the Chasm's defenders, but blades have little power against magic.",""
"115740052-0-16246","And that's where my mages come in.",""
"115740052-0-16247","Our scouts report that some kind of magical fixtures block access to the path across the Chasm. Mages there already work on a way to overcome these fixtures, and we are prepared to lend our strength when the main force arrives.",""
"115740052-0-16248","A sound plan. Plays to our unique strengths. But this one wonders, what if the mages can't overcome Molag Bal's magic?",""
"115740052-0-16249","What a ridiculous question! Of course my mages can overcome this magic!",""
"115740052-0-16250","Ah, magic! The solution to all life's problems. I love magic! It's so … magical.",""
"115740052-0-16251","I have absolute confidence in Vanus and his mages.",""
"115740052-0-16252","Thank you, your lordship. But to be honest with you, I'm not feeling as confident as Vanus about this.",""
"115740052-0-16253","We shall fight with all our strength. There is no other option. Lives will be lost, but hopefully a world will be saved.",""
"115740052-0-16254","Know that the Chasm is only the first stage of this battle. The planar vortex abides within the very heart of Molag Bal's lair.",""
"115740052-0-16255","Oh, this just gets better and better!",""
"115740052-0-16256","Darien! Mind your tongue!",""
"115740052-0-16257","Darien only seeks to lighten a tense situation. Still, we have to try. To do nothing is to doom Tamriel to certain destruction.",""
"115740052-0-16258","Well, when you put it that way, there are a lot of lovely ladies that need to be saved ….",""
"115740052-0-16259","Yes, well, be that as it may, we launch our assault on the Chasm immediately. The King needs to talk to the champion and I must discuss some final details with the mages. The rest of you have your own preparations to see to, I'm sure.",""
"115740052-0-16260","Citizens of Arenthia, bright moons hang above us.",""
"115740052-0-16261","We have thrown back the Colovian invaders. We have reclaimed our homes.",""
"115740052-0-16262","Keep your heads held high, for your part in the fight will not be forgotten.",""
"115740052-0-16263","We rejoin the March, beneath the Eagle's banner! Aldmeri Dominion!",""
"115740052-0-16264","Citizens of Arenthia, your eyes did not deceive you.",""
"115740052-0-16265","Your Mane was corrupted, your streets haunted by Daedric cultists.",""
"115740052-0-16266","This one stands before you, humbled. Your Mane no longer.",""
"115740052-0-16267","The next Mane, whoever they are, must have your trust and loyalty.",""
"115740052-0-16268","I grow weary of this situation. It's time to put an end to Ifriz's interference.",""
"115740052-0-16269","Bright moons light your path as we leave Arenthia's darkest hour.",""
"115740052-0-16270","You need to kill Ifriz. I need him dead. It seems we have a common goal to discuss.",""
"115740052-0-16271","Shazah? Are you all right?",""
"115740052-0-16272","No! I've waited for so long! You won't stop me!",""
"115740052-0-16273","Your sorrow is misplaced. Your sister is at peace. Together, you and she have walked the Two Moons Path to its end.",""
"115740052-0-16274","No! Damnit … I had to let you go once already. I'm not ready to lose you again.",""
"115740052-0-16275","Her soul is at peace now. She has traveled beyond the Path to Aetherius. The light of the Bright Moons surrounding and guiding her.",""
"115740052-0-16276","How can I trust anything I've seen? The Path has shown me terrors, lies … failure.",""
"115740052-0-16277","Shazah … don't cry. Tharn can't hurt me now. I'm at peace. Soon I'll be with Mother and Father.",""
"115740052-0-16278","Please … don't leave me.",""
"115740052-0-16279","Goodbye, my sister. You will be the Mane. You will lead the Khajiit with wisdom and strength. Know always that I love you.",""
"115740052-0-16280","Hallowed, Champion, your journey is complete. Return now to Dune, and begin to walk the next path in your lives.",""
"115740052-0-16281","You there. You're searching for me, aren't you? Let us speak quickly. I don't have much time.",""
"115740052-0-16282","You broke the Ansei Ward? You think that will stop me? I am not finished!",""
"115740052-0-16283","Hey, Aruz! I owe you one! For Borgath!",""
"115740052-0-16284","You are undone by your own heroics, dog. I may not be a lich, but I have an army of undead!",""
"115740052-0-16285","Grab the key. It's in that chest over there. I'll go check on the others. Meet me by the passage door.",""
"115740052-0-16286","You will die. You will die and then you will join my army.",""
"115740052-0-16287","There is no one but the dead here, hero. We made sure of that.",""
"115740052-0-16288","Well done, little mortal. You killed Ifriz and I didn't have to lift a finger. Delightful!",""
"115740052-0-16289","You and I will meet again, I think. I look forward to seeing what trouble you get into next.",""
"115740052-0-16290","You and I will likely meet again",""
"115740052-0-16291","Wait! That's my sister! After her, Hallowed!",""
"115740052-0-16292","Your journey as Champions is complete. The final cleansing begins. Relax your bodies, calm your minds.",""
"115740052-0-16293","On your feet friend. You're going to tell us all about this forest.",""
"115740052-0-16294","I've already told you. The forest is all we live for. You are no threat to me.",""
"115740052-0-16295","We shall see.",""
"115740052-0-16296","Who's that? Is that a Dremora?",""
"115740052-0-16297","Let the light of Jone and Jode wash away your doubts, your regrets!",""
"115740052-0-16298","The cleansing is complete. Moon Hallowed, step forward and speak to me.",""
"115740052-0-16299","They're dead in the water! Mages! Prepare your spells!",""
"115740052-0-16300","Cast at will!",""
"115740052-0-16301","We have incoming! Watch out!",""
"115740052-0-16302","Stand your ground! Wreck these Maormer!",""
"115740052-0-16303","A sea serpent? Damn those Maormer!",""
"115740052-0-16304","Brace for impact!",""
"115740052-0-16305","Load the fire launchers! Burn that beast down before it sinks us!",""
"115740052-0-16306","It did not like that! More incoming! Watch out!",""
"115740052-0-16307","Man the fire launchers! Destroy that damnable snake!",""
"115740052-0-16308","Mage gates? They are teleporting. Prepare to repel boarders!",""
"115740052-0-16309","Mages, capture those portals! We'll use them to launch an attack!",""
"115740052-0-16310","I want that serpent dead! Man the fire launchers! Drop it in the sea!",""
"115740052-0-16311","Well done! Quickly, before they recover!",""
"115740052-0-16312","Enter the portals! Board their ship!",""
"115740052-0-16313","I can do this. Just like forgetting my notes. Here we go.",""
"115740052-0-16314","Oh, wow. Master Telenger's spell is easier than I thought. I think I ….",""
"115740052-0-16315","Something's wrong. What's going wrong? I did it right!",""
"115740052-0-16316","It's … I need … help!",""
"115740052-0-16317","Ahhh ….",""
"115740052-0-16318","What do you have to say now?",""
"115740052-0-16319","Nothing to you, whorespawn. Your kind will never rule the forest, not as long as Selene is its guardian.",""
"115740052-0-16320","What's going on here? You've summoned Daedra into our forest!",""
"115740052-0-16321","We're working on it … please, I'm trying to ….",""
"115740052-0-16322","You're a monster! Our contract is broken. The Green has spoken.",""
"115740052-0-16323","No! Wait!",""
"115740052-0-16324","We'll see about that little one.",""
"115740052-0-16325","Radithax, are you hurt?",""
"115740052-0-16326","I'll be fine. I have the marsh in my veins.",""
"115740052-0-16327","Watch out! It's going to ram us!",""
"115740052-0-16328","Your father, he will not miss you?",""
"115740052-0-16329","No, all that longwhisker cares about is sheep! ""Where are they grazing, <<1>>? What did you feed them? Where did the little one wander off to?""",""
"115740052-0-16330","It is a wonder his fur has not fluffed and coiled!",""
"115740052-0-16331","But still, he provides for you, no? And your mother, before she ….",""
"115740052-0-16332","Yes. Yes, he is owed for that. And if not for him, we would not have met. We would not be so happy as we have come to be!",""
"115740052-0-16333","He will live with us, then? Once we are wed?",""
"115740052-0-16334","If … if your parents will have it, this one will not stand in the way.",""
"115740052-0-16335","Onward! Ha ha!",""
"115740052-0-16336","Oh, <<1>>! How is it we came to find each other? You, a herdsman! Me, the daughter of a great merchant!",""
"115740052-0-16337","Two moons smiled on us and danced us across ja-Kha'jay! And now, once we are wed—",""
"115740052-0-16338","Once mother approves, you mean?",""
"115740052-0-16339","Of course, love! How could <<1>> forget? But once we are together, we bring our dance to the world, yes? On one of your father's finest ships!",""
"115740052-0-16340","It will be wonderful, my dear! But come, you must speak with mother! Surely, we cannot marry without her consent?",""
"115740052-0-16341","Of … of course, my love. Next time we see her, she will know all we plan and we will ask her for her blessing. Aheh. How could she say no?",""
"115740052-0-16342","Our ship has sunk. We must find someone to hire us until the next comes in.",""
"115740052-0-16343","Perhaps we should ask the local government? They will need help rebuilding after that gale, no?",""
"115740052-0-16344","I'm not too keen on that. A little town like this won't be able to pay up front. We're leaving on the next boat we can get, right?",""
"115740052-0-16345","You have a better idea? Spit it out.",""
"115740052-0-16346","Hey, ideas aren't my strong suit! I'm just saying. Look at this place. Do they look like they can afford us?",""
"115740052-0-16347","You have a point. <<1>>, what else?",""
"115740052-0-16348","Let's ask around. I'm sure something will come up.",""
"115740052-0-16349","<<1>>! You used to be in the military! Does the Dominion hire sellswords?",""
"115740052-0-16350","Our ship has sunk. We must find someone to hire us until the next comes in.",""
"115740052-0-16351","Ha! What gave you that idea? … Seriously, keep down about that! I deserted, remember?",""
"115740052-0-16352","Ha! Coward.",""
"115740052-0-16353","You weren't there! You would've fled too, if you'd seen what they asked us to do!",""
"115740052-0-16354","Both of you, calm down! <<1>>. Do they?",""
"115740052-0-16355","I don't know, sometimes? They have a lot of gold. When they hire mercenaries it's to fight someone they can't be bothered with or to chop an enemy down to size. If there's anything left you're paid well. If there isn't ….",""
"115740052-0-16356","So, where are we goin'?",""
"115740052-0-16357","I'm thirsty. Let's find the inn.",""
"115740052-0-16358","Why do you hesitate, girl? You cannot turn back now.",""
"115740052-0-16359","We can't. They kicked us out, remember?",""
"115740052-0-16360","No. When?",""
"115740052-0-16361","Ha! Of course you don't remember! You were on your sixth flagon of Plum Brandy!",""
"115740052-0-16362","Six? That seems low.",""
"115740052-0-16363","Theg, this was after three drams of White-Eye and a flagon of Moon-Sugar Double. You're lucky to be alive.",""
"115740052-0-16364","Hmm. I forgot. They mix brews with moon sugar, here.",""
"115740052-0-16365","Yes, and in most Khajiiti ports. Now, let's think of a way out of this mess, shall we?",""
"115740052-0-16366","We must speak no more.",""
"115740052-0-16367","Hey mortal! Come on over here!",""
"115740052-0-16368","I'm free of this place! Yes!",""
"115740052-0-16369","This disease … we've been here for weeks, and we still know nothing about it. If we can't understand how it's spread, how can we treat it?",""
"115740052-0-16370","We've already lost <<1>> and <<2>>! If we don't leave Orcrest now, the whole team will succumb!",""
"115740052-0-16371","Quickly. The Wilderking is weak. I must get him to the tower. You should come too.",""
"115740052-0-16372","Quickly, I have opened another portal! Hurry!",""
"115740052-0-16373","Elphirion, General Malgoth and the rest of the Blackroot troops are almost upon us.",""

"115740052-0-16377","You mages are as treasonous as your scent is foul. We had an agreement.",""
"115740052-0-16378","I have waited long for this.",""
"115740052-0-16379","I have done nothing to your kind, and yet you come into my home, kill my thrall.nnYou had best live the rest of your life looking over your shoulder. My kind have ways of returning to finish our business.",""
"115740052-0-16380","I can't hold this up much longer…",""
"115740052-0-16381","I beg you, stop this madness!",""
"115740052-0-16382","Don't be weak. Now stand aside, for I wish to feed.",""
"115740052-0-16383","The flu has ravaged the city and the Colovians will be here in days. You have to get your daughter out of here!",""
"115740052-0-16384","No! I cannot allow this to go on!",""
"115740052-0-16385","Fool! Then I will take your blood myself!",""
"115740052-0-16386","The ward must not remain broken! Quickly! You must repair it!",""
"115740052-0-16387","Don't worry, this will get you inside with a minimum of fuss.",""
"115740052-0-16388","One more after this one.",""
"115740052-0-16389","Old friend, it's too late for me. Shazah is in your hands now. Get her home safely. I'll do what I can before the end.",""
"115740052-0-16390","I'm afraid we might need to cut our walk short, Councilman.",""
"115740052-0-16391","Quiet. We are being watched.",""
"115740052-0-16392","We shall see, my pet.",""
"115740052-0-16393","Shazah, please try to be brave. I'm sorry I won't be there for you and your sister, and I pray that the Flu never reaches Dune. Look after our family, and remember always. Your father loves you. Moons above, he loves you.",""
"115740052-0-16394","Thiirril, you look simply ravashing today.",""
"115740052-0-16395","Trouble the living no longer, lady of spiders!",""
"115740052-0-16396","And for your sins you are thus judged. The same fate awaits them all!",""
"115740052-0-16397","You thought you had escaped, but your fate was decided the moment I laid eyes on you, Faenir. There is nowhere your filth can run that I shan't follow!",""
"115740052-0-16398","Thanks for agreeing to find my lute. I'm going to make a run for it!",""
"115740052-0-16399","Dark Master, know that I remain ever faithful.",""
"115740052-0-16400","This one waits and watches for your sign.",""

"115740052-0-16404","Here is another scene. Let's watch.",""
"115740052-0-16405","Elphi, I can't do this. I'm scared. I don't want to die.",""
"115740052-0-16406","No … I must pay for my crimes. I cannot live with this shame.",""
"115740052-0-16407","An outsider pardons this traitor? I will have no part of it!",""

"115740052-0-16414","It's all right, Laenril. The poison itself is slow.",""
"115740052-0-16415","The Blackroot will have cut our throats long before you felt its effects.",""
"115740052-0-16416","Here. We'll drink it together and I'll fight by your side till the end.",""
"115740052-0-16417","Until the end.",""
"115740052-0-16418","If you don't mind me saying, you're quite easy on the eyes Thiirril. You should consider the possibilty of dating a fine specimen like myself.",""

"115740052-0-16420","My fate is sealed. I accept your judgment.",""
"115740052-0-16421","This is madness! She only did this to help!",""

"115740052-0-16659","The name is derived from the veiled queen and our noble traditions.",""

"115740052-0-16705","Insolent intruder! The mage belongs to me!",""

"115740052-0-16719","Another one that didn't make it. We are running out of defenders Gilraen.",""

"115740052-0-16724","There, done.",""
"115740052-0-16725","What do we do now than? We're getting slaughtered.",""
"115740052-0-16726","Laeneval, see if you can aid those defenders. They'll need your healing before the battle is done.",""
"115740052-0-16727","Mortals are always so amusing. I offer information, aid for your quest, and you shun me.",""
"115740052-0-16728","You expect us to trust a creature of the planes? Ridiculous!",""
"115740052-0-16729","You can destroy the Eldest but you cannot have the heart. It belongs here in the Shadow Wood. You will bring it to me.",""
"115740052-0-16730","A mer as arrogant as a kyn. How delightful! I do so love watching egotistical braggarts stumble.",""
"115740052-0-16731","Be gone, foul creature! We don't have time for your games.",""
"115740052-0-16732","I may allow you to reconsider and accept my offer. Of course, I may not. I haven't decided yet.",""
"115740052-0-16733","You there. Find out where that creature is lurking. I want her watched.",""
"115740052-0-16734","I'll see what I can do.",""
"115740052-0-16735","Is this all you've got, you bastards? Come at me!",""
"115740052-0-16736","I can hear him! I'm coming Uncle Sheo!",""
"115740052-0-16737","They're coming through the gates again! We've got to stop them!",""
"115740052-0-16738","Nice work! They'll think twice before they try to get down here again. I'll stand guard while you restore the mages' portal.",""
"115740052-0-16739","Die, Colovian dogs!",""
"115740052-0-16740","Hah. They sent a house cat to fight their battles. Desperate failure.",""
"115740052-0-16741","Khali … Shazah … be safe ….",""
"115740052-0-16742","Let's get moving. We can do this.",""
"115740052-0-16743","That was fun! Meet us outside when you're ready.",""
"115740052-0-16744","As soon as I sensed that you sealed Molag Bal's portal, I figured it was safe enough to follow you.",""
"115740052-0-16745","Yes, Queen Ayrenn. Akkhuz-ri witnessed Indaenir's rebirth.",""
"115740052-0-16746","His spirit was gone from the mortal world. The Valenwood restored him.",""
"115740052-0-16747","Indaenir?",""
"115740052-0-16748","The Mane speaks the truth, Queen Ayrenn.",""
"115740052-0-16749","Cariel herself said Y'ffre chose him. This one agrees.",""
"115740052-0-16750","Then rise Indaenir. It is I who have the honor of bowing to you.",""
"115740052-0-16751","Queen Ayrenn, please. I —",""
"115740052-0-16752","People of the Aldmeri Dominion. I present to you, your new Silvenar.",""
"115740052-0-16753","Come, you must leave this place! Follow me!",""
"115740052-0-16754","Count your victories while you may. Your every step brings the heart closer to me.",""
"115740052-0-16755","Gabrielle has assembled a team of mages and scholars to aid you inside the Labyrinth, as we need all of the fighters for the main assault.",""
"115740052-0-16756","Elolir, go check on those defenders. They took a big hit with the last wave and I want them to be ready for whatever comes next.",""
"115740052-0-16757","I'll make sure they're ready.",""
"115740052-0-16758","Yes. Bring me the heart, and I will grant you a merciful death. Maybe.",""
"115740052-0-16759","Let's just hope we can hold.",""
"115740052-0-16760","Your hopeless heroism ends here!",""
"115740052-0-16761","That was fun, but I guess the main assault needs me. Don't get yourself killed while I'm gone.",""
"115740052-0-16762","At attention, whelps! We've got a challenger!",""
"115740052-0-16763","Look alive out there! I don't want to see sloppy swordsmanship!",""
"115740052-0-16764","This one cannot comprehend … all of this by his hand?",""
"115740052-0-16765","Akkhuz-ri … this one should have fought harder. Fought against the darkness. But he was weak.",""
"115740052-0-16766","Well done! Fadalia will be eager to see you after that showing!",""
"115740052-0-16767","This one is no longer fit to wear the Mane. That much is clear now. All must be told of his decision.",""
"115740052-0-16768","I command here! Die!",""
"115740052-0-16769","I'll let the others know that you've got a way in!",""
"115740052-0-16770","The master's secret must be revealed ….",""
"115740052-0-16771","This hallowed ground is cursed with our blood.",""
"115740052-0-16772","She hasn't the strength. You must be stronger.",""
"115740052-0-16773","Another fine batch of flesh! Fadalia, you've done well.",""
"115740052-0-16774","You've done well! Now, we must secure this place.",""
"115740052-0-16775","Children of the sea! Your bonds cannot hold the tempest!",""
"115740052-0-16776","My sister's pawn, come once more to do her bidding.",""
"115740052-0-16777","Ayrenn will get what's coming to her soon enough.",""
"115740052-0-16778","Your cause is hopeless, and you are outmatched.",""
"115740052-0-16779","Why won't you just die?",""
"115740052-0-16780","The entrance is hidden in plain sight.",""
"115740052-0-16781","I must call an arbiter to oversee my punishment. Leki protect you, friend.",""

"115740052-0-16800","I don't know if the harpies will ever be able to trust us.",""
"115740052-0-16801","Maybe this is the first step. What do you think?",""

"115740052-0-16803","Giant snake glands? I think these are edible, but don't these things attract other snakes?",""

"115740052-0-16836","And this is for all my family! I die, but my father will avenge me! Suturah will avenge us all!",""
"115740052-0-16837","I recognize this moment. The day the Elden Accord was signed! The Mane was a good leader, Hallowed. A good soul.",""
"115740052-0-16838","The day, so long ago, Rid-Thar-ri'Datta first became Mane. A controversial moment, at the time. But an important moment for my people.",""
"115740052-0-16839","Khali was so angry. We both were. The priests were never very kind to us … but look at you and I today. Khali … I wish you were here.",""
"115740052-0-16840","Look up there! The top of the central pillar.",""
"115740052-0-16841","Drown in the river, Breton. I never agreed to this.",""
"115740052-0-16842","Back up, lizard. Your breath offends me. And you most certainly did agree to this.",""
"115740052-0-16843","No! I've been in close contact with the Hidden Armigers. They were angling for a kill on that Cariel wench.",""
"115740052-0-16844","This is what I'm saying. You agreed to the documents in exchange for her location. The Ring of Daggers had what you wanted.",""

"115740052-0-16846","How do you explain this, lizard? We had a deal.",""
"115740052-0-16847","Yes, Argonian. I recall the details of the deal quite clearly.",""
"115740052-0-16848","And the loss of a hundred troops was not in the deal!",""
"115740052-0-16849","Pah, you are both overreacting. What do you care for front-line soldiers? You both received your shipments.",""
"115740052-0-16850","This kind of attack draws attention, lizard. Play us like this again, and you'll learn that cats have sharper claws by far.",""
"115740052-0-16851","We have an opportunity to replace the battlereeve. Ayrenn's head of military matters could be taken out, easily. And perhaps replaced with one of our own?",""
"115740052-0-16852","Tantalizing, Ren-dro. I'll have to talk with the Armigers to see what kind of payment we could offer.",""
"115740052-0-16853","Don't wait for their pitiful offer, Ren-dro. The Ring of Daggers knew this was coming. We have a tentative offer. Here.",""
"115740052-0-16854","Three estates in Cyrodiil? A tract of land in Stonefalls? Isn't this offer a bit presumptive, Ren-Dro?",""
"115740052-0-16855","The lizard is right, Cassel. Your next offer had best not be built on promises and lies.",""
"115740052-0-16856","All right, let's head out. We've got portals to stabilize, you know!",""
"115740052-0-16857","<<1>> is mine!",""
"115740052-0-16858","All right. Farvad, Talia … you know what to do.",""
"115740052-0-16859","All right, let us open the door then.",""
"115740052-0-16861","Tu'whacca demands justice be done!",""
"115740052-0-16864","Yes! That did it. Lead on.",""
"115740052-0-16865","Tu'whacca walks with you, and so will I.",""
"115740052-0-16866","Yes! That did it. Lead on.",""
"115740052-0-16867","This wall will not stand before the power of an Ansei Ward.",""
"115740052-0-16868","It is done. Tu'whacca says it is time for us to go in.",""
"115740052-0-16869","Excellent. We shall put down Shiri as my father put down Suturah before.",""
"115740052-0-16870","It is done. Lead on.",""
"115740052-0-16871","It is done. Alik'r is safe again. Come, hero. Gather my ward.",""
"115740052-0-16872","I have opened a portal to Sentinel. You three may enter, but I must speak with your friend.",""
"115740052-0-16873","Get out of my way, girl. I have no patience for this!",""
"115740052-0-16874","This must be the right way.",""
"115740052-0-16875","I thought I would be more satisfied at his death. I guess it won't bring back those he's killed.",""
"115740052-0-16876","(THIS SHOULD NOT PLAY)",""
"115740052-0-16877","Hopefully, that's the last of the veil. Let's see if we can get through that door now.",""
"115740052-0-16878","The secret lies beyond.",""
"115740052-0-16879","I live … again! And you … you will die!",""
"115740052-0-16880","You!",""
"115740052-0-16881","Sir!",""
"115740052-0-16882","Get the Fighters Guild to provide security for the meeting. We wouldn't want our illustrious Alliance leaders to wind up dead, would we?",""
"115740052-0-16883","Right away, sir!",""
"115740052-0-16884","You!",""
"115740052-0-16885","Yes, sir!",""
"115740052-0-16886","Here's the coordinates for the island of Stirk. Take a couple of people with you and port over. Make sure it's safe and establish a temporary camp there.",""
"115740052-0-16887","I'll get on that, sir!",""
"115740052-0-16888","You're still here? Get a move on and meet your spymaster. We've got a lot of work ahead of us.",""
"115740052-0-16889","There's the sarcophagus. Open it, quickly!",""
"115740052-0-16890","I should think you've gotten quite enough of running blindly into draugr-filled caves. Let's get out of here.",""
"115740052-0-16891","Oh, yes please. Let's do get out of here.",""
"115740052-0-16892","But, I wanted to punch a draugr!",""
"115740052-0-16893","Jofarr, outside is where they keep the mead.",""
"115740052-0-16894","An excellent point. Let's be off, then!",""
"115740052-0-16895","Well, that was easy. Come on, Borald.",""
"115740052-0-16896","At last!",""
"115740052-0-16897","Wait for her to leave. I must speak with you.",""
"115740052-0-16898","The Lava Queen doesn't abide cheaters. Time to die!",""
"115740052-0-16899","I smash you to bits!",""
"115740052-0-16900","You don't belong here, heathen! The Obsidian Husk is a holy stone, not fit for your filthy hands!",""
"115740052-0-16901","I tire of waiting. What news from the General, much honor be upon him?",""
"115740052-0-16902","The runner has not yet returned, ma'am. I am certain that our great leader is attending to vital business. If I may venture a suggestion, perhaps we -",""
"115740052-0-16903","I know that the General has forbidden executions until the Withered Hand has been dealt with, but these scheming asps represent the worst of Sep's children. Ourkinsmen suffered unspeakable shame at their hands, and I will not see them ransomed.",""
"115740052-0-16904","From the icy tundra of Whiterun, the most dangerous beast the frozen reaches have ever spawned!",""
"115740052-0-16905","Prepare yourself, combatants! Pray to your gods and make your peace. You face the Stinger!",""
"115740052-0-16906","This way.",""
"115740052-0-16907","I can finally close my eyes.",""
"115740052-0-16908","Job for Cariel!",""
"115740052-0-16909","We have a new contender!",""
"115740052-0-16910","And here's the release! Look at them go!",""
"115740052-0-16911","No way. Do it yourself.",""
"115740052-0-16912","What? Why?",""
"115740052-0-16913","A magnificent upset! The newcomer wins!",""
"115740052-0-16914","And it's over!",""
"115740052-0-16915","I am certain that the General has plans for them. With respect, we should wait for his ruling.",""
"115740052-0-16916","<<1>> is a homicidal maniac, and <<2>>? Let's just say I'm not her favorite person.",""
"115740052-0-16917","You are right, private - of course. But there is no harm in being prepared. Tell the men to assemble a detail - five bowmen with sharp eyes and stone hearts … and I suppose a priest as well. Even these dogs deserve Tu'whacca's last rites.",""
"115740052-0-16918","Why is <<1>> displeased with Cariel?",""
"115740052-0-16919","I may have collapsed a building on top of her. Accidentally.",""
"115740052-0-16920","Ah, yes. This one forgot about that. nnVery well. Raz will take care of it. And he will send <<1>> your warmest regards.",""
"115740052-0-16921","Damn you, Lyranth! I see your hand in this. I'll make sure you join your clan in the darkness.",""
"115740052-0-16922","Mortal fools, duped by an outcast kyn. I will take great pleasure in ending your lives!",""
"115740052-0-16923","Dammit, Raz, not so close!",""
"115740052-0-16924","The word has been given.",""
"115740052-0-16925","Come forth, children of the dark moon!",""
"115740052-0-16926","Protect me while I work!",""
"115740052-0-16927","A moment, please.",""
"115740052-0-16928","I grow weary of your meddling. Prepare to die!",""
"115740052-0-16929","Our representative, Captain Alphaury, is in charge of security on Stirk. He assures us that all is well there, but keep your wits about you. Good luck.",""
"115740052-0-16930","Please. Don't let them hurt me. Not again, not like … please.",""
"115740052-0-16931","There we are. After you, your majesty.",""
"115740052-0-16932","I'll see you on Stirk, then.",""
"115740052-0-16933","I'll wait for you on the other side.",""
"115740052-0-16934","Meet me below the Wood Orc fort. The Orcs must pay.",""
"115740052-0-16935","You can't stop <<1>>. Hail Sithis!",""
"115740052-0-16936","A search party won't be necessary, Laurosse. It seems you still have much to learn about me.",""
"115740052-0-16937","Erinel! I'm so glad to see you, though your presence is … something of a surprise. I should have known you'd navigate the woods with ease.",""
"115740052-0-16938","You should have, my sweet. And if you ever call me 'delicate' again … well, those aren't words for polite company.",""
"115740052-0-16939","Indeed, my dear. You have me at a loss again.",""
"115740052-0-16940","No! Damn you, First Mane!",""
"115740052-0-16941","Sister! Please reconsider!",""
"115740052-0-16942","This is the way it must be. Sister, do not weep for me.",""
"115740052-0-16943","Friend, it is Azei! I must speak with you!",""
"115740052-0-16944","There has to be a way to get out of here … wait a moment … something bad is about to happen ….",""
"115740052-0-16945","This creature is now contained. Leave this place … sister.",""
"115740052-0-16946","Sometimes I hate it when I'm right. Here they come!",""
"115740052-0-16947","Come on! We need to find a way out of here.",""
"115740052-0-16948","I need to get this door open. Hold them off while I work on this!",""
"115740052-0-16949","Pssst. Over here. This one used an illusion spell. Very little effort.",""
"115740052-0-16950","The door's finally open! Let's go!",""
"115740052-0-16951","Fjar, reporting in, sir.",""
"115740052-0-16952","Not rid of me yet. Sir.",""
"115740052-0-16953","Returning to duty.",""
"115740052-0-16954","<<1>> is tainted by evil. He will never again be fit to lead our people.",""
"115740052-0-16955","Our hope lies with these women, the Champions. One of them will be Mane. You must help them walk the Path … for you are the Moon Hallowed.",""
"115740052-0-16956","Without a new Mane, the Khajiit will fall. The Dominion will fall. Walk well in the light of Jode and Jone, and you shall succeed. Moon Hallowed.",""
"115740052-0-16957","That giant portal up ahead is the thing we need to smash? Hopefully this won't be too easy.",""
"115740052-0-16958","Been a while since we heard from you, sweetheart. We started thinking you might have run off. But you wouldn't do that, would you?",""
"115740052-0-16959","Oh no, I wouldn't think of doing that. We are all friends here—is it not so?",""
"115740052-0-16960","Yeah, we're all friends here. You're smart, Feraj. 'Course, being smart doesn't make up for being late. And you are very late.",""
"115740052-0-16961","The days have not been kind to us. You see, the harpies … please, just a few more days!  I will pay what you are owed—with interest!",""
"115740052-0-16962","I have to be honest with you, Feraj. That's not what I wanted to hear. So it's either the money or your teeth. I'll give you a minute to decide which.",""
"115740052-0-16963","So, what's the bet?",""
"115740052-0-16964","A hundred gold says there's an attempt on our lives within the week.",""
"115740052-0-16965","That's a sucker bet! The Hidden Armigers have hit us at least once a week for the past three months.",""
"115740052-0-16966","All right. Three hundred says when the Dominion spies contact us, it'll be Cariel, not Razum-dar.",""
"115740052-0-16967","Cariel? That wench knows better than to show her face around me. Mark my words, I'm going to have to hunt her down to slit her throat.",""
"115740052-0-16968","And after you do, that three hundred gold will buy you enough ale to celebrate for a year!",""
"115740052-0-16969","I'll take that bet!",""
"115740052-0-16970","And share the ale, if you win. Let's go. We have a lot of work to do.",""
"115740052-0-16971","Ah, health and vitality! Welcome back!",""
"115740052-0-16972","And now stamina returns. How I've missed you, old friend!",""
"115740052-0-16973","Stop fighting me, Zur! Stay put!",""
"115740052-0-16974","For the initial assault, Cadwell will assist you. Don't be fooled by his bizarre antics, for his heart is full of courage and honor.",""
"115740052-0-16975","What is this? It looks like the prisim I was kept in at the Black Forge.",""
"115740052-0-16976","This device seems to be drawing energy from the creature up there. Try adjusting it slightly.",""
"115740052-0-16977","Someone, get me out of here!",""
"115740052-0-16978","Release me!",""
"115740052-0-16979","No! What's happening to me?",""
"115740052-0-16980","Is it true? Did Hilka really sell us out?",""
"115740052-0-16981","It seems so.",""
"115740052-0-16982","Come on, Hald. You know how angry she is. I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner.",""
"115740052-0-16983","Yeah, but treason? Doesn't that seem a bit too, I dunno, subtle? Besides, she's the most patriotic of all of us.",""
"115740052-0-16984","We did it!",""
"115740052-0-16985","Yes, but what about that other thing?",""
"115740052-0-16986","Say what?!?",""
"115740052-0-16987","You know, the portal thing.",""
"115740052-0-16988","Damnit! Let's discuss this back in the Hollow City.",""
"115740052-0-16989","Turns out I'm glad you came, Virian. I'm calling in that favor.",""
"115740052-0-16990","Overcompensation.",""
"115740052-0-16991","You mean you called me here without knowing if you needed me, Thrush? Ugh. What's the favor?",""
"115740052-0-16992","Yeah. Maybe.",""
"115740052-0-16993","I need you to contact the other spy networks, the Eyes of the Queen of the Aldmeri Dominion and the Ring of Daggers in the Daggerfall Covenant.",""
"115740052-0-16994","Is someone out there? I'm in a cocoon! Help!",""
"115740052-0-16996","I knew that coward was a liability. If I ever see Hald again I'll gut him myself.",""
"115740052-0-16997","Get off it, Hilka. You can't honestly think Hald was capable of this.",""
"115740052-0-16998","Why because he had it rough? That only makes him more susceptible. He didn't have the stomach for the work anymore. Kind of like some other people I know.",""
"115740052-0-16999","All right, knock it. Let's just get through the rest of today without losing anyone else.",""
"115740052-0-17000","Over here. I know what Talmo wants. But I have an alternative proposal for you.",""
"115740052-0-17001","Fjar was the traitor? Family-man Fjar? I could kill that Daedra-spawn. Thragof, give me a month and dispensation, and I'll have his entire family in Pact hands.",""
"115740052-0-17002","Stendarr's Mercy, Hilka. Don't you think that's taking it a bit far?",""
"115740052-0-17003","Contact. You do mean with the tips of my daggers. Repeatedly. Right?",""
"115740052-0-17004","A traitor's a traitor, Hald. All traitors get what's coming to them.",""
"115740052-0-17005","No, no, this is a diplomacy thing. No killing.",""
"115740052-0-17006","Waste of a favor, Thrush. Should've asked for something your lackeys couldn't do. We're even after this, you know.",""
"115740052-0-17007","Grashla! Thushbeg! No! This cannot be!",""
"115740052-0-17008","I know, but this is important. Thanks, Naryu.",""
"115740052-0-17009","Nobody's getting anything right now. Cool off, the both of you. Fjar's not getting away from us. If the higher ups want Fjar, you'll be the first to know.",""
"115740052-0-17010","Murderer! I will crack open your bones!",""
"115740052-0-17011","My son! You took my son!",""
"115740052-0-17012","You've come too late. The ritual has begun, and you cannot strike me down.",""
"115740052-0-17013","Gadris' teleport spell worked! This one is here! Be careful, friend. The Dwarven constructs have awakened.",""
"115740052-0-17015","Whatever you say, Thrush.",""
"115740052-0-17016","Over here! The constructs have moved away from the forge.",""
"115740052-0-17017","Here they come!",""
"115740052-0-17018","Ready!",""
"115740052-0-17019","Fire!",""
"115740052-0-17020","Another little skeever? We'll gut you like the others.",""
"115740052-0-17021","Get out! Get out of my house!",""
"115740052-0-17022","I'll even ride with you as far as Auridon. Let's go.",""
"115740052-0-17023","Dro-m'Athra, free yourselves and destroy the intruder!",""
"115740052-0-17025","I'll see you on Stirk, friend.",""
"115740052-0-17026","They won't see reason. Their hatred runs too deep.",""
"115740052-0-17027","Some wounds take longer to heal. They have an abundance of time to learn that lesson.",""
"115740052-0-17028","The barrier is down! But before we proceed, I need to speak with you.",""
"115740052-0-17030","Once the Drom'Athra are free, all of Reaper's March shall be ours!",""
"115740052-0-17031","It's done. They're all dead.",""
"115740052-0-17032","I'll see you on Stirk, friend.",""
"115740052-0-17033","It's not enough. For what you're asking, I need more.",""
"115740052-0-17034","How can I possibly deliver the whole village?",""
"115740052-0-17035","Your village sits below a volcano. Volcanoes erupt. With the right prodding.",""
"115740052-0-17036","Now, Nidras …. Hmm. I guess he went upstairs. That boy's steps are as light as feathers.",""
"115740052-0-17037","The floodwaters rise! Our deal is good then, yes?",""
"115740052-0-17038","Yes. The village will be ours, and you shall have your gold.",""
"115740052-0-17039","Oh, how exciting! I wonder if I should've washed my hair first …. Nah!",""
"115740052-0-17040","Denthis, Dithis! You two guard the portal. Tell anyone coming through to push ahead. The source of the reinforcements must be cut off!",""
"115740052-0-17041","I'll scout on ahead. We need to know what we're going to face at that gatehouse.",""
"115740052-0-17042","I will not stand for this! I won't let you harm my children!",""
"115740052-0-17043","Excellent! Now, how do I get out of here?",""
"115740052-0-17044","That was not part of our deal. Enjoy your gold.",""
"115740052-0-17045","More of them coming! Keep those bows ready!",""
"115740052-0-17046","It is done. Soon, your father will be dead.",""
"115740052-0-17047","Then at last, I will lead.",""
"115740052-0-17048","You will, indeed, rule at last. When the rockslide swallows the entire stronghold.",""
"115740052-0-17049","What fortune!",""
"115740052-0-17050","This is Line 1 of Conversation 1.",""
"115740052-0-17051","This is Line 2 of Conversation 1.",""
"115740052-0-17052","This is Line 3 of Conversation 1.",""
"115740052-0-17053","Hmm. Perhaps <<1>> should examine her purchase.",""
"115740052-0-17055","I've fought beside each of you. I know you're worthy of  Sovngarde. It won't be long before we feast together in the Hall of Valor!",""
"115740052-0-17056","No! I won't let you harm my children!",""
"115740052-0-17058","No! What are you doing? No!",""
"115740052-0-17059","You're no guard. Grab that key on the table and open these cages!",""
"115740052-0-17060","Another successful mission, but we're not finished yet!",""
"115740052-0-17061","The diversion I set up is working. Hurry before the Daedra notice and come after us!",""
"115740052-0-17062","Enter the garden and collect the Lifeshadow Crystal. Then place it on the central dais at the entrance.",""
"115740052-0-17063","Enter the frozen alcove and collect the Flameshadow Crystal. Then place it on the central dais at the entrance.",""
"115740052-0-17064","Enter the library and collect the Mindshadow Crystal. Then place it on the central dais at the entrance.",""
"115740052-0-17065","You would think Zur would be fearless in the face of darkness. You would be wrong.",""
"115740052-0-17066","Help me find <<1>>! She must've gone further!",""
"115740052-0-17067","That's the beast that webbed me! Take care, friend.",""
"115740052-0-17068","I hope you know what you're doing, friend.",""
"115740052-0-17069","Well done, my friend. Now enter the oubliette and set me free.",""
"115740052-0-17070","<<1>>! Do you know how long I've been looking for you?",""
"115740052-0-17071","I'm sorry, sweetness … how did we get here again?",""
"115740052-0-17072","Strange … we were in a mine. But we're outside your father's house now ….",""
"115740052-0-17073","Never mind that silly daydream, my dearest.",""
"115740052-0-17074","You silly oaf! Oh, I can't stay mad at you, love!",""
"115740052-0-17075","Creature! I gladly take my love's place!",""
"115740052-0-17076","Hush now, sweetling. Come, and rest.",""
"115740052-0-17077","You have done well to make it this far, but there is still more to do to set me free.",""
"115740052-0-17078","You're in my head! Get out, get out!",""
"115740052-0-17079","There, now. Isn't that better? Don't fight, just … let go.",""
"115740052-0-17080","My body is imprisoned within a pillar of darkness, generated by the ebon shards to each side.",""
"115740052-0-17081","Place a Light of Meridia in both of the sconces. Each will create a beam of light that will strike a nearby crystal.",""
"115740052-0-17082","By rotating the crystals, you can change a beam's direction. You may need to rotate a crystal multiple times to connect the beams and form a path of light to the ebon shards.",""
"115740052-0-17083","Adjust the crystals until the beams of light destroy the ebon shards. Then the pillar of darkness will collapse and I shall be free.",""
"115740052-0-17084","Hello again, Manthir. Fine day this, don't you think?",""
"115740052-0-17085","Surely you know by now. I want us to be married. I will return the coin I stole in exchange.",""
"115740052-0-17086","I'm so happy you feel the same way!",""
"115740052-0-17087","Yes, yes. Let's get on with it. Make your demand, Farwen.",""
"115740052-0-17088","I thought as much. So I must marry you or be gutted by the fat cat's thugs. Oh, very well ….",""
"115740052-0-17089","I, Manthir, acknowledge that you Farwen rightfully stole my coin, and in exchange for its return, I agree to marry you.",""
"115740052-0-17090","Cadwell, your mastery of portals does you proud!",""
"115740052-0-17091","I-I'm sorry Haidar.",""
"115740052-0-17092","That strange gem over there may be important. Or valuable. Maybe you should take it.",""
"115740052-0-17093","Go. I will follow your lead, and deal with the tears as we find them.",""
"115740052-0-17094","I have waited a very long time for this moment. You have done well, my child.",""
"115740052-0-17095","Molag Bal's Dark Anchors form a vortex that sucks Nirn into his dark realm. We must break these vile chains.",""
"115740052-0-17096","My power is greater in this between place.",""
"115740052-0-17097","The Dark Prince will need stronger chains than that to stop me. Come, we have things to discuss.",""
"115740052-0-17098","I feel faint ….",""
"115740052-0-17099","Interfering wretch! You'll leave this place in pieces!",""
"115740052-0-17100","What're you doing, foreman?",""
"115740052-0-17101","Me? Uh, I'm just practicing. Nothing more!",""
"115740052-0-17102","Better not shoot any harpies. That's our job. And you don't want to take our job away, right?",""
"115740052-0-17103","What're you looking at? Get lost.",""
"115740052-0-17104","<<1>> sent another poor bleeding heart, boys! Get in here!",""
"115740052-0-17105","The harpies are much bolder. We need more coin, for supplies and the like.",""
"115740052-0-17106","I've heard disturbing rumors about your methods ….",""
"115740052-0-17107","Something is coming through the tear!",""
"115740052-0-17108","Have you heard about the traveler stirring up trouble in town … and look who's here.",""
"115740052-0-17109","Keep your opinions about our work to yourself.",""
"115740052-0-17110","Father! You need to know what's going on out there!",""
"115740052-0-17111","Who is this? Someone come to help?",""
"115740052-0-17112","Enough! I have no patience for your theories!",""
"115740052-0-17113","Fine. If you want the truth, come talk to me.",""
"115740052-0-17114","But if he leaves us…",""
"115740052-0-17115","If he is gone, how are we here?",""
"115740052-0-17116","Ugorz! Put out that fire!",""
"115740052-0-17117","I'm beside myself. You truly believe you've won.nnI didn't expect our little friends there could kill Erthas, but I stand corrected. All this trouble because of one Bosmeri woman? You are Gilraen, of the Whisper Grove, are you not?",""
"115740052-0-17118","I wish I had your confidence.",""
"115740052-0-17119","I am.nnAre you … Mehrunes Dagon?",""
"115740052-0-17120","A Wilderqueen! Wondrous news.",""
"115740052-0-17121","It was you who rallied this peasant village to contend with me. Fascinating that a mortal could be so troublesome.nnI need a replacement for your Erthas. Come. Meet with me, and I will close this Gate, spare your people.",""
"115740052-0-17122","Get up here, Zirani! It's time for your beatings.",""
"115740052-0-17123","Trust a Daedric Prince? You must think I was born yesterday. Still ….",""
"115740052-0-17124","I think … I think I have little choice. Tell the others to get as far away from here as they can.",""
"115740052-0-17125","We must put aside our differences and work together or this assault is doomed from the start.",""
"115740052-0-17126","How do we know this isn't a ruse? A clever plan to divert our forces while your armies take the Imperial City?",""
"115740052-0-17127","I thought backstabbing was your favorite tactic, Emeric!",""
"115740052-0-17128","Please! Are you both so arrogant? Your weapons are children's toys compared to the horrors that Molag Bal commands!",""
"115740052-0-17129","I will not wager the future of my people on the word of a snow barbarian and an adolescent female. I fear for Tamriel's future if either of you were to sit upon the Ruby Throne!",""
"115740052-0-17130","Since when do you care about your people? You never lift a finger except to count your gold!",""
"115740052-0-17131","Please, my lords! This bickering is pointless!",""
"115740052-0-17132","I need to conserve my energy for dealing with the Shackle, so I leave the hacking and slashing up to you.",""
"115740052-0-17133","We need to locate the source of energy that provides the power for the Shackle.",""
"115740052-0-17134","Remarkable! This could be what we were looking for.",""
"115740052-0-17135","Very interesting. It appears to be similar to the cage I was imprisoned in at the Black Forge. Examine this pedestal and tell me what you make of it.",""
"115740052-0-17136","The chains bind both planes. We cannot use the light until those chains are destroyed. Go quickly!",""
"115740052-0-17137","No! What have you done! Oh, wait. You reversed the energy flow. Good work! Now go upstairs and find the other conduits.",""
"115740052-0-17138","Something isn't right. Keep going on ahead!",""
"115740052-0-17139","We have to hurry! Molag Bal knows we're here!",""
"115740052-0-17140","Thank you. I thought I was done for!",""
"115740052-0-17141","By Akatosh's scales—your help is welcomed!",""
"115740052-0-17142","I grow weary of your games, Meridia!",""
"115740052-0-17143","Go, Warriors of Light! These dark chains must be broken!",""
"115740052-0-17144","You cannot stop me, Meridia. This realm will be mine!",""
"115740052-0-17145","We're running out of time. I'll make sure these anchors are destroyed. You have to keep moving! Place the light and disrupt this vortex.",""
"115740052-0-17146","I beg of you, daughter. Try to forgive me. What I did was a foolish mistake. I never imagined anyone else would be at risk.",""
"115740052-0-17147","Hello? Can you let me out of this cage, please?",""
"115740052-0-17148","I don't know what to do. I'm so angry at him … and yet … my father is all I have left.",""
"115740052-0-17149","You, there! Over here! Would you be so kind as to open this cage?",""
"115740052-0-17150","What nerve, running your mouth right in front of me!",""
"115740052-0-17151","I think I can forgive you, father, though it may take time. For now, it's best if we leave this place.",""
"115740052-0-17152","Oh, my dear girl. I will do everything in my power to make this up to you and to the others.",""
"115740052-0-17153","Go on! Damn that hurts … I'll make sure nothing follows after you. Go!",""
"115740052-0-17154","I'm sticking with her, my friend. Gabrielle and me, we've been through a lot. I'm not going to leave her alone.",""
"115740052-0-17155","Darien ….",""
"115740052-0-17156","No one else dies today. That's an order. Come on, let's go set the light in place.",""
"115740052-0-17157","By the Kwama Queen that hurts! No worries, I'll be all right. Should have done more stretches. Try not to do anything heroic without me. I'll only be a moment.",""
"115740052-0-17158","He … he has arrived! I can't ….",""
"115740052-0-17159","Keep watch while I close this.",""
"115740052-0-17160","I believe that is the focal point. Place the light and let's finish this.",""
"115740052-0-17161","Take your hands off me!",""
"115740052-0-17162","<<1>>! What's happening?",""
"115740052-0-17163","Bring me the heart!",""
"115740052-0-17164","Go! Get away from me! Run!",""
"115740052-0-17165","Your pitiful town won't survive without our protection.",""
"115740052-0-17166","We can do without you. Go, and never return.",""
"115740052-0-17167","And we'll run out anyone else who tries to bully us too!",""
"115740052-0-17168","May the sands take your accursed town!",""
"115740052-0-17169","If we see you again, we'll throw you to the harpies!",""
"115740052-0-17170","Let's head south. There's a ladder leading up into the city.",""
"115740052-0-17172","These are the great leaders of Tamriel? Pathetic. But how convenient to have them gathered together in one place, so I can crush them like insects.",""
"115740052-0-17173","I swear, I'll keep my nose so clean I could whistle through it!",""
"115740052-0-17174","Molag Bal!",""
"115740052-0-17175","Stay back, Countess!",""
"115740052-0-17176","Come, father. We need to make plans to travel to the Hollow City.",""
"115740052-0-17177","The insects fight back! How amusing, and yet so very sad.",""
"115740052-0-17178","I keep thinking of Gamirth and what happened to him. I don't think I can forgive you, father, but I'll try not to hate you.",""
"115740052-0-17179","Here it is, just as promised!",""
"115740052-0-17180","No, Nelhilda, please! What will we do? What will we do?",""
"115740052-0-17181","Listen, everyone! I am going to the Hollow City. We will be safer there. It is time for most of us to leave this cursed tavern.",""
"115740052-0-17182","You can stay here, father. In your precious tavern. Think about what your success has cost you and remember all that you have lost.",""
"115740052-0-17183","Maybe one day Nelhilda will find it in her heart to forgive me. I'll stay here and wait. Help anyone who happens by. And drink. There's always drink.",""
"115740052-0-17184","The light approaches. It brightens the shadows. It attempts to break the darkness.",""
"115740052-0-17185","But the darkness is strong. Our father, our god—he is the darkness. He shall repel the light.",""
"115740052-0-17186","Our father approaches. He will consume the light. He will tear it apart. He will destroy it. He will destroy you!",""
"115740052-0-17187","Our father has spoken. He wishes us to challenge you and you alone.",""
"115740052-0-17188","All of Nirn shall be mine!",""
"115740052-0-17189","Let's hope this works.",""
"115740052-0-17190","All right then.",""
"115740052-0-17191","What … what's going on? No!",""
"115740052-0-17192","You believe that light can destroy my Planemeld? Your Prince thinks I would allow this? She is more foolish than I thought.",""
"115740052-0-17193","Oh, how sad. You were drafted into a war you could never win. My council shall destroy you. I shall enjoy watching a hero die!",""
"115740052-0-17194","I live to serve. It will be my pleasure to destroy this one, my lord.",""
"115740052-0-17195","The hand of our king may fall, but his shadow reigns supreme!",""
"115740052-0-17196","The light purges the shadow, but darkness still exists. I curse the light!",""
"115740052-0-17197","Most curious. This light powers you somehow. Meridia … where are you hiding?",""
"115740052-0-17198","Merely fetching those who would stand against you.",""
"115740052-0-17199","Well done! With Molag Grunda defeated, the entirety of the Chasm is now under our control.",""
"115740052-0-17200","I tire of this game. Now you shall die!",""
"115740052-0-17201","Quickly, get behind my shield!",""
"115740052-0-17202","The light is ready! Quickly, release it!",""
"115740052-0-17203","Gathwen is rounding up the troops. I asked her to keep an eye on Darien, as well. He's a terror with a sword, but sometimes I think he takes too many chances.",""
"115740052-0-17204","Meet me outside. We have things to discuss and I find these Daedric halls extremely distasteful.",""
"115740052-0-17205","Come, Gabrielle, let us prepare the portal.",""
"115740052-0-17206","You don't have to do this alone. I can stay with you. Maybe shield you from whatever happens.",""
"115740052-0-17207","You have to go, Gabrielle. Please … just go and be safe.",""
"115740052-0-17208","You all must leave before it's too late. Remember … remember to tell stories of the Heroes of Coldharbour. The one who brought us all together. Who brought us to victory. Even in death, I shall remember each of you.",""
"115740052-0-17209","As I will remember you both as well, my friends. Gabrielle … come. It is time.",""
"115740052-0-17210","Darien … I …",""
"115740052-0-17211","I'll find a way back to you. Somehow. If we can defeat a Prince in his own realm … we can do anything, right? Be sure to tell stories about the handsome knight who defeated Molag Bal, eh?",""
"115740052-0-17212","I will … I promise.",""
"115740052-0-17213","We salute you, brave heroes.",""
"115740052-0-17214","Goodbye … everyone.",""
"115740052-0-17215","I will harvest your soul for the Deadlands.",""
"115740052-0-17216","Know that you may jump from here and rejoin your friends below. What power I still possess shall keep you safe.",""
"115740052-0-17217","The harpy's matriarch … was this the reason they started attacking in the first place?",""
"115740052-0-17218","Tharn is quite correct. We have little choice in the matter.",""
"115740052-0-17219","Where in blazes is everyone? This should be the right spot ….",""
"115740052-0-17220","I knew we couldn't be that lucky. The Shade has blocked the way.",""
"115740052-0-17221","Let's see.",""
"115740052-0-17222","These pedestals look as if they're still active.",""
"115740052-0-17223","Yes, I know what to do.",""
"115740052-0-17224","Tu'whacca extends his hand! You need only enter the portal, and you will be transported back to the desert below.",""
"115740052-0-17225","Help … me ….",""
"115740052-0-17226","Bakkhara? Is that you?",""
"115740052-0-17227","Now you're in for it, you weak-willed swabs!",""
"115740052-0-17228","I warn you—the Naemon you faced before was fettered by fear … and mortality. I have no such limitations.",""
"115740052-0-17229","You are throwing your life for naught. The Heart is already corrupted. There's nothing you can do about that now.",""
"115740052-0-17230","Rise my pretties!",""
"115740052-0-17231","Very well. Come and witness my wrath achieved. Then you will die.",""
"115740052-0-17232","Y'ffre's bones! He's turned so many … we have to stop this!",""
"115740052-0-17233","As formidable as you may be, I fear we couldn't get through here in the physical realm.",""
"115740052-0-17234","A house of stone? But how did they get the stone to move?",""
"115740052-0-17235","They dug it up and broke it into pieces and brought it here. I saw the wagons.",""
"115740052-0-17236","I wonder if I could climb it.",""
"115740052-0-17237","No!",""
"115740052-0-17238","You're no fun!",""
"115740052-0-17239","There's your proof, Master Pellingare. It was your children responsible for this madness.",""
"115740052-0-17240","Hrmf. Belike I'll just have to rely on me old shaman's tricks to put right me new crew.",""
"115740052-0-17241","These creatures the Prince throws at us are nothing!",""
"115740052-0-17242","I like Nords! They fight so cheerfully!",""
"115740052-0-17243","Let these creatures see the true power of my people. Nothing can stop us now.",""
"115740052-0-17244","We must be getting close and that must be making them nervous. Why else throw all these monsters at us?",""
"115740052-0-17245","We're approaching that vile portal of wrong-doing. I can feel it in my bones. It feels like … evil.",""
"115740052-0-17246","No matter how many creatures the Dark One sends against us, I will make each and every one of them bleed.",""
"115740052-0-17247","Ah finally, a formidable foe!",""
"115740052-0-17248","Ah, another beautiful creature has fallen under Molag Bal's spell of evil! We must set her free!",""
"115740052-0-17249","Now that is a worthy adversary! There will be no shame if we lose this battle.",""
"115740052-0-17250","With that portal closed, Molag Bal's reinforcements won't be able to overwhelm us. Now let's get to the Labyrinth.",""
"115740052-0-17251","Another victory! I'm going to run out of room on my scabbard! Where will I mark my kills?",""
"115740052-0-17252","This victory satisfies me greatly. Now let us go forth and find more blood to spill!",""
"115740052-0-17253","Haha! We did it. We make a pretty good team. You know, if I had to judge our performance. So … I guess we should keep heading on? Not sure how Vanus is going to reach us though.",""
"115740052-0-17254","Let's show them how we fight back in Skyrim, my friends!",""
"115740052-0-17255","This one shall miss you, my beloved. But this one must not despair.",""
"115740052-0-17256","This one has children … young ones that depend on me. Ahirunz shall find a way to return to them. On this pendant, so Ahirunz swears!",""
"115740052-0-17257","The way is open. Destroy Seris. Painfully. He deserves whatever horrors you decide to inflict upon him.",""
"115740052-0-17258","Jode's bones! What is that thing?",""
"115740052-0-17259","I will not leave my children!",""
"115740052-0-17260","I'm sure you know where you're going, but we still have work to do in the Orchard.",""
"115740052-0-17261","Come talk to me. I must explain your role in the next stage of the ritual.",""
"115740052-0-17262","Come. I need to explain the next steps to you. At this point, we can't afford for anything to go wrong.",""
"115740052-0-17263","My poor daughter. Why did you do this?",""
"115740052-0-17264","I'm tired of the forest realm. I want to see how the world has changed in our absence.",""
"115740052-0-17265","And ye're prepared to abandon family, father? Friends? The Wilderking?",""
"115740052-0-17266","I've given enough time to each, I think. I want to see the world before I die.",""
"115740052-0-17267","Ha! We'll make a necromancer of you yet.",""
"115740052-0-17268","Help! Is anyone there? Help!",""

"115740052-0-17299","Our brethren? You mean to consider those who would take up arms along side our former slave masters our brethren? I would sooner call a mud crab brother than anyone who would fight along side a Dunmer!",""

"115740052-0-17355","You couldn't just leave it sitting here, could you, Blackheart? Paranoid bastard.",""
"115740052-0-17356","A lich! Hope you're ready for a second death, you undead bastard!",""
"115740052-0-17357","This confirms my suspicions. Mannimarco has a terrible plan in mind for you and your soul. By chance, I wonder, or by design?",""
"115740052-0-17358","The Redguard's iron will cannot be overcome with standard interrogation techniques. Physical tortures appear to be useless.",""
"115740052-0-17359","I have therefore instructed the Daedra to move Sai Sahan into the Halls of Torment. The Duchess will be most pleased to have a new … guest.",""

"115740052-0-17362","<<1>>, what have they done?",""
"115740052-0-17363","You will not break me, King of Worms!",""
"115740052-0-17364","What does it look like? They dug up my barrow!",""
"115740052-0-17365","You cannot break the will of a son of Yokuda! I spit on you!",""
"115740052-0-17366","What? Why?",""
"115740052-0-17367","Wouldn't stop asking about the roots.",""
"115740052-0-17368","The roots? Why would they care about the …. Oh no.",""
"115740052-0-17369","Told them they were asking for trouble, but did they listen? Went right to the Barrowbough. Idiots.",""
"115740052-0-17370","Hey, friend! Listen, we have a problem.",""
"115740052-0-17371","Ah, the Amulet of Kings. Never has such an object been the focus of so much desire, or had the potential for so much chaos. This is what Sai Sahan hid away, and while this doesn't help us directly, it should give you some idea as to the stakes.",""
"115740052-0-17372","So, Sai Sahan is alive, and he has not been broken. An important piece of the puzzle, to be sure, but where is he being kept?",""
"115740052-0-17373","Leave us alone! I don't want anyone else to die.",""
"115740052-0-17374","This is the information we've been looking for!",""
"115740052-0-17375","Hey, friend! Listen, we have a problem.",""
"115740052-0-17376","By the Empyrean Light, move faster! The more bones you find, the sooner we can all get out of this pit.",""

"115740052-0-17380","What horror is this?",""
"115740052-0-17381","See to this one's brother. Bakkhara will destroy Canonreeve Oraneth's final altar, which sustains this realm.",""
"115740052-0-17382","Oraneth will be pleased with this progress.nnYou Orcs know how to dig in the dirt, I'll give you that.",""

"115740052-0-17388","We have to get out of here!",""
"115740052-0-17389","The Shackle formed a planar vortex. Kind of like an Oblivion straw that will suck Nirn right through and into Coldharbour. Quite amazing how I knew that!",""
"115740052-0-17390","What? Explain yourself, man! What planar vortex?",""
"115740052-0-17391","There we have it. We can talk here or back at the Mages Guild, at your discretion.",""
"115740052-0-17392","<<1>>! We need your help. It's an emergency!",""
"115740052-0-17393","<<1>>! Who put you back together? Are you to blame for these Worm Cultists?",""
"115740052-0-17394","Not at all! Well, not exactly. I'll let my friend fill you in.",""
"115740052-0-17395","Let's get this over with.",""
"115740052-0-17396","I'll talk to them. Make them understand. Maybe I'll get through this time.",""
"115740052-0-17397","This is for their sake. I don't them to hurt themselves. Everything I've done has been for them.",""
"115740052-0-17398","Be ready.",""

"115740052-0-17401","Thank you for coming, all of you.",""
"115740052-0-17402","We have all heard the grumblings. But if this is to be our home, we must end this talk of defying the Dominion.",""
"115740052-0-17403","Y'ffre can give us hatchlings, <<1>>. Peace with the Dominion is our only chance of survival.",""
"115740052-0-17404","I follow Y'ffre to forge a new path for our people. But you, Slim-Jah, command their respect. Please, listen to reason, we must join the Dominion.",""
"115740052-0-17405","You tail-lifting fool! Do we ignore the slave pen they build around us? This Wood Elf god you follow corrupts your mind.",""
"115740052-0-17406","While you whisper to trees, the Dominion measure our wrists for manacles! I cannot allow this.",""
"115740052-0-17407","<<1>>, you turn our people away from the Hist. I sanction you for your heresy!",""

"115740052-0-17471","They'll be here any moment. You three should get over there as soon as you can.",""
"115740052-0-17472","We're on our way. Thank you, Captain.",""
"115740052-0-17473","We must make haste.",""
"115740052-0-17474","I can't imagine venturing outside the city. There are so many horrible places out there.",""
"115740052-0-17475","I heard the Lightless Oubliette is the worse, Molag Bal only keeps his greatest enemies there.",""
"115740052-0-17476","As long as we stay inside the walls, Molag Bal's minions shouldn't be able to drag us off to the Court of Contempt.",""
"115740052-0-17477","I heard that Molag Bal is trying to pull Tamriel into Coldharbour.",""
"115740052-0-17478","You just heard that? Didn't you know that's why we're here?",""
"115740052-0-17479","He must be using lots of Daedra and some sort of machine to accomplish that!",""
"115740052-0-17480","Enter my mind, Vestige, and walk with me through the shadows of past events.",""
"115740052-0-17481","Fadalia, your life is spared. Leave, and never return.",""
"115740052-0-17482","So the Wood Elves have a friend who's not afraid to fight? Good. Give me your best.",""
"115740052-0-17483","My disciples, this stranger speaks the truth. We must go to the graveyard.",""
"115740052-0-17484","I will explain more soon. But for now, call upon an arbiter. She must hear my confession as well.",""
"115740052-0-17485","Leki grant me strength … I must not delay any longer!",""
"115740052-0-17486","Ahh, quite the view from up here, eh? I meant the landscape. Don't get any ideas.",""
"115740052-0-17487","All right, let's find the rest of me! Try searching the Wormie camps, or knocking some skeletons around until my bits fall out.",""
"115740052-0-17488","Efficient little nitwits. Could be a part of me in every skeleton here!",""
"115740052-0-17489","Soldier, I appreciate your vigilance, but the Argonians in <<c:1>> are guests. Refrain from any further displays of zeal or I'll have you scrub down the barricade. Dismissed.",""
"115740052-0-17490","Follow me, Vestige, and learn of the events that precipitated our current crisis.",""
"115740052-0-17491","That was my femur! Wait, no, my femur bends to the left. Carry on!",""
"115740052-0-17492","Ha, that tickles!",""
"115740052-0-17493","Look at all the dirt on my bones! I used to bathe weekly to keep myself presentable.",""
"115740052-0-17494","My pelvis is filthy! What did the Wormies do, use it as a shovel?",""
"115740052-0-17495","Ah, that's the last one. Quickly, now! Drop my pieces on the ground and I'll put myself back together.",""
"115740052-0-17496","Sai Sahan is where? Oh no …",""
"115740052-0-17497","<<1>>? What have you done?",""
"115740052-0-17498","What will you make us lose this time, <<1>>?",""
"115740052-0-17499","You should have left, <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-17500","<<1>> will not forgive you again.",""
"115740052-0-17501","Why, <<1>>? Why return?",""
"115740052-0-17502","My part in the story began when I awoke on the steps of the Abbey of the Moth Priests, with no memory of my prior life.",""
"115740052-0-17504","The Moth Priests took pity upon me and brought me into their fold. I was weak and near death.",""
"115740052-0-17505","The master commands your death.",""
"115740052-0-17506","<<1>>! You were banished, yet you dare return?",""
"115740052-0-17507","Die, bloodsuckers!",""
"115740052-0-17508","<<1>>, listen to me! We're in danger. Necromancers are trying to kill the Barrowbough!",""
"115740052-0-17509","You warn of danger. <<1>>, who leveled nations with his girth!",""
"115740052-0-17510","It was there I first set eyes upon the Elder Scrolls and devoted my life to their study.",""
"115740052-0-17511","Merciful Stendarr, hear my prayer. I've never prayed to the Divines before. Even when my wife… even when you took my wife, I accepted it as fate. But At'avar, how can I accept that?",""
"115740052-0-17512","The Scrolls allowed me to glimpse the very fabric of reality, but each profound insight dimmed my vision and eventually left me permanently blinded to the light of the world.",""
"115740052-0-17513","That … that was a mistake. But if the Worm cult gets its way, we will walk the world once more! Our bones will destroy the cities of Nirn and there will be nothing we can do to stop them!",""
"115740052-0-17514","If anyone deserves your mercy, it is At'avar. Please, Stendarr, free him from this curse. Bring me back my son.",""
"115740052-0-17515","Together? Since when have you done anything that wasn't for yourself?",""
"115740052-0-17516","<<1>>, wait!",""
"115740052-0-17517","My friend, make him see reason!",""
"115740052-0-17518","<<1>>!",""
"115740052-0-17519","The first companion, Lyris Titanborn, daughter of giants, was the mightiest warrior in the service of the Emperor.",""

"115740052-0-17521","The Redguard swordmaster Sai Sahan, leader of the Imperial Dragonguard.",""
"115740052-0-17522","The Imperial Emperor, Varen Aquilarios, who attempted to light the Dragonfires and failed.",""

"115740052-0-17524","The time has come, Champion.",""
"115740052-0-17525","Stendarr protect us all.",""
"115740052-0-17526","There it is. The Dragonfire brazier. Mannimarco, you're certain this will work?",""
"115740052-0-17527","It will work, my liege. The Amulet of Kings will rekindle the Dragonfires, and ensure your rightful place as Emperor. You have my word.",""
"115740052-0-17528","It better work, Mannimarco, or you'll find your neck at the business end of my axe.",""
"115740052-0-17529","My Lord, I wonder if you'd muzzle your half-giant pet? She really is annoying.",""
"115740052-0-17530","Enough, both of you! We are here to ensure My Lord's rightful claim to the Ruby Throne.",""
"115740052-0-17531","Quickly, now! Into the portal!",""
"115740052-0-17532","Abnur, begin the ritual. I have a destiny to fulfill.",""
"115740052-0-17533","Hello, what's this?",""
"115740052-0-17534","Tongues of Xarxes! What is that thing?",""
"115740052-0-17535","Make it go away! Make it go away!",""
"115740052-0-17536","The companions assemble once more. Travel to the harborage; it is time for our final preparations.",""
"115740052-0-17537","By the lighting of the Dragonfires, I claim my rightful lineage! By the fires of creation, let me be reborn! By the will of Akatosh, I proclaim myself … Dragonborn!",""
"115740052-0-17538","Stay back! This blade must not be touched!",""
"115740052-0-17539","Varen Aquilarios, you are no heir to Alessia! You will pay for your sacrilege! The veil between Tamriel and Oblivion tears and splits asunder!",""
"115740052-0-17540","Unlock the tower door!",""
"115740052-0-17541","This isn't supposed to happen! What's the meaning of this? Mannimarco, what have you done?",""
"115740052-0-17542","What's happening? The sky is opening up! This is bad! This is very bad!",""
"115740052-0-17543","Thank you, living one. I will relish this vengeance and then enjoy my rest.",""
"115740052-0-17544","Behold the fate of the King of Worms.",""
"115740052-0-17545","Stop. Before you enter this village, a word with you.",""
"115740052-0-17546","Please! No more! It was a misunderstanding, great one! Let me serve you. Let me prove my loyalty. No more, I beg of you!",""
"115740052-0-17547","Mannimarco's torment will be endless. The God of Schemes will use him to set an example. All who follow him will know, you cannot hope to betray the greatest of betrayers.",""
"115740052-0-17548","I cannot help but pity him, despite all he has done.",""
"115740052-0-17549","But, this is not why you were called here, Vestige. Come. Sai Sahan would speak with you first.",""
"115740052-0-17550","We should not tarry from our task.",""
"115740052-0-17551","Gullible fools! The veil between Oblivion and this world has been torn! My master, Molag Bal, is free to claim Tamriel for his own!",""
"115740052-0-17552","Oops! Are my vines getting in your way?",""
"115740052-0-17553","I'll open a portal to hasten your journey.",""
"115740052-0-17554","Akatosh! Forgive me! Have mercy on our souls!",""
"115740052-0-17555","You've done your part. Get back to <<1>> when you can.",""
"115740052-0-17556","Psst. Over here!",""
"115740052-0-17557","There you are.",""
"115740052-0-17558","Oh, <<1>>.",""
"115740052-0-17559","Wow. I wish <<1>> could have seen that thing.",""
"115740052-0-17560","Long ago it was written—so long as the Amulet of Kings was borne by Alessia's heirs, Tamriel would be protected from the forces of Oblivion. But the Soulburst tore the veil between worlds, and gave Molag Bal the opportunity he desired.",""
"115740052-0-17561","Thank you for freeing us! You can't imagine the things we've seen.",""
"115740052-0-17562","Those fools! What are they doing?",""
"115740052-0-17563","The town is just down the path.",""
"115740052-0-17564","Everything must follow the appropriate process, or a judgment can't be reached. We must begin again.",""
"115740052-0-17565","You have been accused of disseminating illicit materials that are an affront to Imperial law. Arrest him!",""
"115740052-0-17566","I've done no wrong. I merely studied the ancient texts. Is that a crime worthy of an Imperial prison?",""
"115740052-0-17567","That man can be rather … trying.",""
"115740052-0-17568","Don't worry, old man. You're not going to an Imperial prison. We have a very special place in mind for you.",""
"115740052-0-17569","What is this? The abbey burns!",""
"115740052-0-17570","I've read about such things, but the books don't do it justice.",""
"115740052-0-17571","I can't stand that man.",""
"115740052-0-17572","Molag Bal's Dark Anchors pierce the torn veil, and seek to draw Nirn into the depths of Coldharbour. These terrible engines of destruction have been appearing all throughout Tamriel.",""
"115740052-0-17573","The worms and their master will pay for this!",""
"115740052-0-17574","Kasura!",""
"115740052-0-17575","There!",""
"115740052-0-17576","Kasura! Are you injured? What happened?",""
"115740052-0-17577","Ah, Sai Sahan and company, at last! My pet has been waiting for you.",""
"115740052-0-17578","Thank you, friend! Meet us in Longhaven when we're all out of here. I'm sure Nivrilin will reward you for this!",""
"115740052-0-17579","Kill a few more of those overgrown lizards for me! I'll see you in Longhaven.",""
"115740052-0-17580","You have this one's gratitude. Jone and Jode protect you.",""
"115740052-0-17581","Areldur! You live!",""
"115740052-0-17582","I … perhaps you are right. Forgive an old warrior's foolish notions. This is not the time for silly dreams. You should go speak with Lyris now.",""
"115740052-0-17583","I do, though I've seen better days. The High Kinlord's power has grown.nnHe would not have been able to escape our predecessors as he has escaped us today. We need to go after him.",""
"115740052-0-17584","My lord, with your permission.",""
"115740052-0-17585","You needn't call me that anymore, Sai Sahan. We are equals now.",""
"115740052-0-17586","All those years ago, when we fought beneath our lord's banner to free the Empire from the Longhouse Emperors, we did so with a dream of freedom and peace in mind—not just for the Empire, but for all of Tamriel.",""
"115740052-0-17587","Together we forged a fellowship stronger than any blade, only to see it shattered upon the rocks of deceit by one of our own.",""
"115740052-0-17588","That fellowship is no more, yet we four have assembled here, united by a single purpose. It is not vengeance that drives us, but truth and loyalty and justice.",""
"115740052-0-17589","I, Sai Sahan, steward of the Abbey of Blades, call for the Five Companions to be reforged this day.",""
"115740052-0-17590","Stay down, Keeper, you're injured.nnIf the others yet live, we should find them—then deal with Rilis, if we can. He has already escaped. I will not suffer further dishonor by losing lives to him.",""
"115740052-0-17591","By the light of Stendarr, and the heart of Lorkhan, may our blade of fellowship be forged anew. And may the Vestige, our mutual friend and ally, become its tip, that we may thrust it straight into the heart of a Daedric Prince.",""
"115740052-0-17592","You're ever the optimist. An Altmer should not fear the end, Cirion.nnI would give the lives of all four of us to stop Rilis. The High Kinlord will rend Tamriel apart if he gets to the surface. And it will be our fault.",""
"115740052-0-17593","Sai Sahan is right. You are the member that we should have had all those years ago.",""
"115740052-0-17594","It is as the Scrolls foretold. The soulless one will become the brightest of five stars, and they shall guide us to the coming dawn.",""
"115740052-0-17595","Oh, please. You melodramatic sots! Fine, fine. If seeing one of your foolish prophecies come true will help to ensure the safety of the Empire, I'll play along.",""
"115740052-0-17596","There is a difference between fearing death and throwing your life away, Areldur. nnAnd as long as I lead the Keepers, you will do neither. If the others live, we'll find them.",""
"115740052-0-17597","We stand united once more—the Five Companions are reforged, and together we will strike down the God of Schemes!",""
"115740052-0-17598","Come here, my friend. I've got a few things I want to say before you go.",""
"115740052-0-17599","Jahi sent you, didn't she?",""
"115740052-0-17600","I'm sorry. I shouldn't have cut the plant. Please, spare me.",""
"115740052-0-17601","Honored leaders! You have seen the face of our enemy!",""
"115740052-0-17602","Molag Bal threatens every living being in Tamriel! The Mages Guild and the Fighters Guild have agreed to join forces to launch an assault on Coldharbour!",""
"115740052-0-17603","Your restlessness trapped us here in the first place!",""
"115740052-0-17604","There are a vast number of Elf bones in <<Ac:1>>. If we all use them together, we can drive out the invader!",""
"115740052-0-17605","Once more you bring danger upon us, then beg for our help to end it. No longer! You'll remain beneath the Barrowbough until the world forgets you!",""
"115740052-0-17606","I don't …",""
"115740052-0-17607","How many more of your friends must die, Sai Sahan? Where is the Amulet of Kings?",""
"115740052-0-17608","Trust in us! Sanction our actions! Give us your blessings! We will not let you down!",""
"115740052-0-17609","Oh, that one is definitely mine. I can feel it.",""
"115740052-0-17610","We will pour every iota of our strength into those items. Take them to the crypts beneath the ruined chapel.",""
"115740052-0-17611","I am the Snake. I hide in the tall grass and close on my prey with lightning speed. I'm cunning, agile, and fierce.",""
"115740052-0-17612","Vanus is right. The Guilds are our best and only choice. Send them to Coldharbour!",""
"115740052-0-17613","It is strange to return to these mountains. Memories of youth flood my mind, each one bringing its own sorrow, or its own smile.",""
"115740052-0-17614","Kasura often said that rudeness is a weak man's imitation of strength. She is wise beyond her years. You will like her, Snow Lily.",""
"115740052-0-17615","I hate to admit it, but I agree with Emeric.",""
"115740052-0-17616","Watch. My prey does not see me coming until it's too late.",""
"115740052-0-17617","As do I. It appears that much of the distrust between our alliances was sown and nurtured by the God of Schemes.",""
"115740052-0-17618","I'm the Spinner. The village expects more of me, and I failed them.",""
"115740052-0-17619","I didn't have a choice! It was just one plant—I would have died otherwise.",""
"115740052-0-17620","Molag Bal thrives on deception and chaos, but if you'll forgive me, this Alliance War is of your own making.",""
"115740052-0-17621","Let's not forget the struggles that got us to this point. We're almost home. We just have a bit further to fight.",""
"115740052-0-17622","Are you all insane? You do realize what we need to do, right? We have to fight a Daedric Prince. Amulet or no, this is going to mean more death. Vestige! Come here. I'll tell you what they're afraid to mention.",""
"115740052-0-17623","Arkay, forgive me. When I realized what they were doing to us, I tried to throw myself from this tower.",""
"115740052-0-17624","From such desperation, I found the anger and strength to resist this torment. We must slay the flesh abomination. We can do this. Together.",""
"115740052-0-17625","Countess Hakruba. Gather the surviving members of both Guilds in the <<1>>. The champion and I will go there now to open the portal.",""
"115740052-0-17626","Stibbons! Thank the Radiant Mother you're all right. When I saw <<1>> with your jewels, I feared the worst!",""
"115740052-0-17627","Poor Quintus.  Always a little clumsy … in his research, in murdering people. In … relationships.",""
"115740052-0-17628","It's Voranil! Areldur, see to him.",""
"115740052-0-17629","By the Empyrean Light! Let's hope he lives.",""
"115740052-0-17630","Ah, here come some new friends. Let's see if I've still got the touch.",""
"115740052-0-17631","Slaughter. Still delightful after all these years.",""
"115740052-0-17632","Deceive and strike. The way of the Snake is dark and calculated. Remember this.",""
"115740052-0-17633","All right? How can you say that? They have my dear Lady Laurent's jewels! She will be quite distraught if I don't retrieve them.",""
"115740052-0-17634","At least you're alive. That's something! I know a secret tunnel by the pools. I can lead you there while our friend fetches your lady's jewelry. What do you think?",""
"115740052-0-17635","Of course it is. The fact of the matter stands, however. One of the Five will need to give their life to fuel this attack, when the time comes.",""
"115740052-0-17636","So you said before the Vestige arrived. And I've already thought it over. I'll do it.",""
"115740052-0-17637","Snow Lily, no! You should not need to give your life this way. This is my duty—penance for my numerous failures. This is my chance to make things right.",""
"115740052-0-17638","The Scrolls said nothing of this moment, and so I am not bound to their dictates. Vestige, I ask that you let me do this one thing. All that has happened was because of my hubris. I shall be the one.",""
"115740052-0-17639","We'll be right behind you, Vanus.",""
"115740052-0-17640","Sire, you've done enough. This was Mannimarco's doing, not yours.",""
"115740052-0-17641","As the one who will fight the Daedric Prince, the Vestige should decide.",""
"115740052-0-17642","I don't see you leaping to volunteer, Tharn. Saving your own backside again?",""
"115740052-0-17643","Hard as it may be, Lyris, don't be an idiot. I am the only one who knows the ritual and we don't have time to teach anyone else.",""
"115740052-0-17644","That's enough. It won't be decided here and now. Vestige, come here. I have some final words for you.",""
"115740052-0-17645","Follow me. The hidden entrance will not be obvious.",""
"115740052-0-17646","Has he been slain?",""
"115740052-0-17647","He's not the model of well-being, but he lives.nnAre you satisfied, Cirion? I'm eager to pursue the High Kinlord.",""
"115740052-0-17648","Patience, Areldur. I need you to heal him. And Imiril is still unaccounted for. We'll need her to face Rilis.",""
"115740052-0-17649","The energy source is aligned—I think it's animating! Kill for your masters, Stormfist!",""
"115740052-0-17650","A valiant effort, but the invasion will proceed as planned. My storm will behead Malabal Tor, and the Maormer army will feast on its remains.",""
"115740052-0-17651","The storms are powerful, now! You'll die before I let you touch the Conduit Stone!",""
"115740052-0-17652","It's too late to stop the storm, now. Your death will be the first of many.",""

"115740052-0-18252","Wonderful. It's Telenger.",""
"115740052-0-18253","The captain in charge of security, Alphaury, is over there.",""
"115740052-0-18254","The vault is just past this room. We're almost there.",""
"115740052-0-18255","Good, you're finally coming out of it. We should … reintroduce ourselves.",""
"115740052-0-18256","Look out! Another anchor!",""
"115740052-0-18257","I swear by Stendarr's grace and the sword of my father, you will not win, Mannimarco!",""
"115740052-0-18258","Your pathetic efforts will not succeed! The Amulet of Kings will be mine!",""
"115740052-0-18259","Through the power of the Amulet of Kings, I will be transformed!",""
"115740052-0-18260","Champion. It is time. You are at the end of your path.",""
"115740052-0-18261","The vault door is open! Let's go!",""
"115740052-0-18262","As the Lunar Champion, you have proven yourself time and time again a leader of our people, but do you truly understand what it means to be the Mane?",""
"115740052-0-18263","Yes. I've walked the path and know what lies ahead and honor those left behind.",""
"115740052-0-18264","As the Lunar Champion, you have proven yourself time and time again a leader of our people, but do you truly understand what it means to be the Mane?",""
"115740052-0-18265","You've begun the path and know what lies ahead of our people. Are you prepared to lead your people?",""
"115740052-0-18266","Yes, I accept this role in service of kith and kin.",""
"115740052-0-18267","Then wear this as leader of our people and rise, Mane of our people.",""
"115740052-0-18268","Continue the path, young one, and accept this blessing for the journey ahead.",""
"115740052-0-18269","Rejoice one and all! Long live the Mane!",""
"115740052-0-18270","Draven, wait!",""
"115740052-0-18271","We can't go through the town. Not after what's happened.",""
"115740052-0-18272","Renchant, you bastard … I rue the day I gave you the throne. What you've done … is nothing less than treason.",""
"115740052-0-18273","Guard! Come get this coward out of my sight!",""
"115740052-0-18274","Such despair! Richer than a cheese sorbet!",""
"115740052-0-18275","Yes, Your Majesty. As you wish.",""
"115740052-0-18276","I'll come quietly, Guardsman.",""
"115740052-0-18277","Now that he's been dealt with, we have real work to do. Please, meet me outside.",""
"115740052-0-18278","<<1>> is near those glowing stones. Be careful!",""
"115740052-0-18279","The time has come to demonstrate the true power of my kind. We are not simply monsters who eat children! We are so much more.",""
"115740052-0-18280","One last quest, old chap! One last leap into the fire! Unless we survive, of course. But how likely is that?",""
"115740052-0-18281","You've come through these trials and emerged victorious.",""
"115740052-0-18282","And make it entertaining, would you? After spending so much time in this town, I finally know where the Colovians keep their fur hats.",""
"115740052-0-18283","I know I can activate the Welkynd Stones. Let's see what happens.",""
"115740052-0-18284","Bridge is out! My boredom washed it away. Really got in the cracks, there!",""
"115740052-0-18285","Well, well. It appears you're not so special after all!",""
"115740052-0-18286","Very well then. Arzhela, my fate is in your hands. You know I made the only rational choice.",""
"115740052-0-18287","I was wondering when you were going to arrive, Adusa.",""
"115740052-0-18288","I wouldn't call it rational, Renchant. I would call it cowardly. Eamond died defending this kingdom … and you'll die for betraying it.",""
"115740052-0-18289","Mara's bosom, Bugbekh! What do you plan on burying out here? A mammoth?",""
"115740052-0-18290","It was for King Eamond - but then I hear that they carted his body south to Bangkorai Garrison.",""
"115740052-0-18291","I had no idea the King was that fat.",""
"115740052-0-18292","Watch your tongue you lout. Our king was a good and honest man. It's a tragedy what happened to him.",""
"115740052-0-18293","Yes, yes, whatever you say. You never did answer my question though. What is this hole for?",""
"115740052-0-18294","Well we can't bury the king here so we got the next best thing.",""
"115740052-0-18295","If only I could turn back time … just a few hours ….",""
"115740052-0-18296","What's that?",""
"115740052-0-18297","His horse …. Mauloch's jawbone, I've got a lot of work to do.",""
"115740052-0-18298","Medya, what is it? Is Sir Etienne all right?",""
"115740052-0-18299","I had to dig three more crows out of my chimney flue this morning. We may have suffocated if not for the dog barking.",""
"115740052-0-18300","Believe me, I can empathize. I've found bird droppings in my porridge twice in the last week.",""
"115740052-0-18301","I've never seen the like. What could be causing it?",""
"115740052-0-18302","Witchcraft I should think. Or maybe something with the weather. Who knows—I'm hardly a scholar.",""
"115740052-0-18303","Well I'm off to Shara's shop to buy a bow and arrow.",""
"115740052-0-18304","Are you sure that's wise? If there truly is a hex on this town, I'd give those crows a wide berth.",""
"115740052-0-18305","Perhaps you're right. Maybe I'll just buy a cat and see what happens.",""
"115740052-0-18306","Do what you want. I have nothing left to live for.",""
"115740052-0-18307","Hey you, please wait!",""
"115740052-0-18308","Here she comes now …. Rashan. We have a volunteer to destroy Uela's totems.",""
"115740052-0-18309","I don't understand why you're so upset, darling. It's not like they need their valuables any more.",""
"115740052-0-18310","Those are our dearly departed! Because of you, our dead ancestors are trying to kill us!",""
"115740052-0-18311","This isn't my fault. You returned the cursed heirlooms, but your dear papa is still trying to kill us. Clearly, these two things aren't the least bit related.",""
"115740052-0-18312","Why do I get the feeling we're going to regret this?",""
"115740052-0-18313","This is your chance to fix this mess. Go, deal with the ""mayor."" If <<1>> bores him, <<2>> will leave.",""
"115740052-0-18314","There. That place should serve us well. Let us assemble and prepare the ritual.",""
"115740052-0-18315","It would be my pleasure!",""
"115740052-0-18316","Kill this worm.",""
"115740052-0-18317","Abnur, why don't you show this puppet, magic's true potential?",""
"115740052-0-18318","This just isn't your day. But your Uncle <<1>> can make it better!",""
"115740052-0-18319","Greetings, vestige. Although, perhaps that term no longer applies. Come — we must talk.","Saluti, spirito. Anche se, forse ora questa nomìa non è più idonea. Vieni - dobbiamo parlare."
"115740052-0-18320","What is this?",""
"115740052-0-18321","This has got to be the source of the spell. Let's destroy it!",""
"115740052-0-18322","Wait a moment. Let's regroup before we move on.",""
"115740052-0-18323","Free Will! Get out here, there's someone I want you to meet!",""
"115740052-0-18324","Toodles!",""
"115740052-0-18325","Ah, I found you at last! Come out of there so we can talk.",""
"115740052-0-18326","Renoit! Stay back!",""
"115740052-0-18327","Look what we have here.",""
"115740052-0-18328","Quiet … I think I hear something.",""
"115740052-0-18329","What is this?",""
"115740052-0-18330","It's time you paid for what you did to our world.",""
"115740052-0-18331","He's doing fine. And when he returns, you all will leave?",""
"115740052-0-18332","We'll stay until Murcien's Hamlet is free, or Sir Etienne and I both fall in the fight.",""
"115740052-0-18333","I see. Well, he'll be resting comfortably soon, don't you fret.",""
"115740052-0-18334","Sai Sahan! Intruders … cultists … they attacked the abbey. So many of my students have fallen ….",""
"115740052-0-18335","It's Draven! It's got to be! Come on!",""
"115740052-0-18336","The abbey is in ruins, Kasura! How could they …?",""
"115740052-0-18337","Let's go. There's nothing left for us in this town.",""
"115740052-0-18338","A gigantic beast … like nothing I've ever seen! The cultists … they're opening rifts to Oblivion!",""
"115740052-0-18339","Save your strength, Kasura. We will make them pay, I promise you!",""
"115740052-0-18340","Draven? Oh, you're … back to a werewolf.",""
"115740052-0-18341","You'll pay for this, Kerbol!",""
"115740052-0-18342","Draven is no more. He's an animal, only fit to be put down!",""
"115740052-0-18343","Save our village! Strike down the beast!",""
"115740052-0-18344","I'll go see to the poor knight now, then.",""
"115740052-0-18345","This looks like the place. I guess you're the one who's going in.",""
"115740052-0-18346","He's gone. I can only hope he'll be all right.",""
"115740052-0-18347","Foul troll. Begone!",""
"115740052-0-18348","I'm sorry, Renoit. Gods be with you.",""
"115740052-0-18349","No! What've you done?",""
"115740052-0-18350","Aha! More knucklebones for my necklace!",""
"115740052-0-18351","Remember, with gusto! A big steaming pile of it!",""
"115740052-0-18352","There. Back in the physical realm. Time to do this.",""
"115740052-0-18353","Good. Good, he's all right. Now, let's go over what we need.",""
"115740052-0-18354","All right! The door should be open now! Go get me that heart!",""
"115740052-0-18355","He's locked the door!",""
"115740052-0-18356","There must be some way to unlock it. Check around the altars.",""
"115740052-0-18357","Stand back from the door. This will take but a moment.",""
"115740052-0-18358","Confound that beast. Let's get moving! Looks like someone opened the door ahead.",""
"115740052-0-18359","It is done.",""
"115740052-0-18360","What do you mean, coming to kill me?",""
"115740052-0-18361","It's a gift! A chance to shine, to prove you have some backbone that won't snap at the lightest touch! Really, Aulie, I'm quite fond of you. Mmm. Fondue. What was I saying?",""
"115740052-0-18362","That you're fond of me. That you don't want to watch me die!",""
"115740052-0-18363","Watch you die horribly, all alone, and laughing my head off when it happens? That doesn't sound like me. Does it? But I'm sure you can work the matter out for yourself.",""
"115740052-0-18364","Good! Looks like everyone ended up in the right place. Let's get to our positions.",""
"115740052-0-18365","Please, don't do this! Maybe we can work something out?",""
"115740052-0-18366","There it is! The Amulet of Kings!",""
"115740052-0-18367","You're too late, old friend. This place is already slipping into Coldharbour. The Amulet of Kings is mine!",""
"115740052-0-18368","Show yourself, worm! Face us! Or are you a coward?",""
"115740052-0-18369","How can I refuse such a humble request? The Amulet of Kings is mine! I am the new God of Schemes! And yours will be the first soul I tear apart!",""
"115740052-0-18371","My friend tells me something's stirred up the Wood Orcs again.",""
"115740052-0-18372","Gods, I need help! My liege, no!",""
"115740052-0-18373","Pah! This one has had enough of Wood Orcs for a lifetime.",""
"115740052-0-18374","The Bramblebreach clan is under constant attack, lately.",""
"115740052-0-18375","No doubt the Dominion will offer their help, in exchange for an alliance. Turning the misfortunes of others to their advantage. That is their way.",""
"115740052-0-18376","I hear that someone drove the Wood Orcs away from Bramblebreach.",""
"115740052-0-18377","This one heard the same. Heard they ran away like cowards.",""
"115740052-0-18378","All except for their War Captain. He stayed and fought.",""
"115740052-0-18379","It's good for the Bramblebreach, but this one wonders how long their isolationist ways can last. Wood Orcs aren't the only threats in Valenwood.",""
"115740052-0-18380","I heard an interesting story the other day.",""
"115740052-0-18381","Not another of your stories.",""
"115740052-0-18382","The Wood Elves deep in the forest say there's a being called the Wilderking who shapes Valenwood.",""
"115740052-0-18383","Sounds like a load of superstition to me.",""
"115740052-0-18384","Strange happenings in the Court of the Wilderking. Did you hear?",""
"115740052-0-18385","More Wilderking nonsense.",""
"115740052-0-18386","No nonsense. This is real. They say an Altmer girl saved his life, and then took his place.",""
"115740052-0-18387","You are too gullible, friend.",""
"115740052-0-18388","I'd tell you how your sister was doing if I could.",""
"115740052-0-18389","Something's wrong. I know it! What aren't you telling me?",""
"115740052-0-18390","The Maulborn are here to help, my friend. I'm sure your sister is being well cared for. I'm sorry, I can't tell you anything else.",""
